It can be a very complicated thing .PERIOD The ocean .PERIOD 
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .PERIOD 
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell .PERIOD But you know what they came out saying .PERIOD 
We made the ocean unhappy .PERIOD We made people very unhappy ,COMMA and we made them unhealthy .PERIOD 
We see the base of the food chain ,COMMA the plankton ,COMMA the small things ,COMMA and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid and on so up .PERIOD This diagram .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA a dolphin ,COMMA mother dolphin ,COMMA any dolphin -- there's only one way that a pcb can get out of a dolphin .PERIOD 
And what's that .PERIOD 
Here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay .PERIOD 
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .PERIOD 
That's a tragedy for those populations ,COMMA but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don't know that that's toxic meat .PERIOD 
These same infections create harmful algal blooms .PERIOD 
I started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry and all of the attendant problems .PERIOD 
It's an ocean planet ,COMMA and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,COMMA but the pyramid of life in the ocean .PERIOD And our own lives ,COMMA on land are intricately connected .PERIOD 
It's a huge driver for culture ,COMMA and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior .PERIOD 
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime ,COMMA that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA cut to the modern day .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA we'll do something with it .PERIOD 
Puppets always have to try to be alive .PERIOD 
It's their kind of ur-story onstage ,COMMA that desperation to live .PERIOD 
His mother was a puppeteer .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA it took about <NUM> years to discover the bambara bamana .PERIOD Puppets of mali in west africa ,COMMA where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry ,COMMA to learn a renewed ,COMMA or a new respect for this art form .PERIOD 
So we made a model .PERIOD 
And we had a crate built for it .PERIOD 
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town ,COMMA and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet .PERIOD 
A month later ,COMMA we were there in london ,COMMA with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .PERIOD 
And we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely .PERIOD 
And here is our factory in cape town ,COMMA where we make horses .PERIOD 
I'd just like to describe -- i won't talk too loud ;SEMICOLON he might get irritated .PERIOD 
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .PERIOD 
When they point right back ,COMMA the horse is fearful or angry ,COMMA depending upon what's going on in front of him around him .PERIOD 
The hind legs have got the same action .PERIOD 
And mikey also has in his fingers ,COMMA the ability to move the tail from left to right ,COMMA and up and down with the other hand .PERIOD 
And together there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression .PERIOD 
And it's very ,COMMA very simple ,COMMA because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees .PERIOD 
But of course it was the cane is light ,COMMA the cane is flexible ,COMMA the cane is durable and the cane is moldable .PERIOD 
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders ,COMMA like many of the people here by new tools ,COMMA like the ones we've seen here ,COMMA and by new pressures .PERIOD 
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Now this may surprise you .PERIOD 
Now we have wikipedia .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA big things can be done for love .PERIOD 
Take a look ,COMMA if you haven't at donorschoose .PERIOD 
The third category is represented by warren buffet ,COMMA which i call aggregated giving .PERIOD 
It's that he challenged another assumption ,COMMA that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation .PERIOD 
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .PERIOD 
And that's where my imagined future comes in ,COMMA which i am going to call the social singularity .PERIOD 
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme .PERIOD 
That's why i have one last thing .PERIOD I want to show you .PERIOD 
And they were great community leaders .PERIOD 
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because i've always felt a mystical connection to these two men ,COMMA both of whom i never knew .PERIOD

And what do i mean by that .PERIOD 
And i asked them to come along with the person they communicate with ,COMMA most .PERIOD 
What we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a regular basis with five six ,COMMA seven of their most intimate sphere .PERIOD 
He just wants to wish her a good day ,COMMA because that's the start of her day .PERIOD 
They chat to each other every day a few times a day actually .PERIOD 
But it could be in a school .PERIOD It could be an administration .PERIOD It could be a hospital .PERIOD 
If you were not ,COMMA you maybe had to go through an operator .PERIOD 
The phones were there ,COMMA but the expectation was once you moved in there .PERIOD Your commitment was fully to the task at hand .PERIOD Fully to the people around you .PERIOD 
This only started about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working .PERIOD 
Companies blocking access to im ,COMMA or to facebook .PERIOD 
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months ,COMMA and only for about a few years' worth of coal .PERIOD 
Now judy and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other .PERIOD 
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that .PERIOD This is what it's all about .PERIOD 
And we know that eco-industrial business ,COMMA these kinds of business models -- there's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park ,COMMA where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another .PERIOD Or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .PERIOD 
And in my hometown ,COMMA we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx ,COMMA but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .PERIOD 
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce .PERIOD 
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic ,COMMA stability .PERIOD 
The recession has us reeling and fearful .PERIOD And there's something in the air these days .PERIOD That is also very empowering .PERIOD 
There goes my dog ,COMMA who led me to the park in my wedding .PERIOD

Hometown security is next on my to-do list .PERIOD

This is in the early 2000s ,COMMA my son ,COMMA dimitri -- who's here ?QUESTIONMARK Many of you know .PERIOD Dimitri -- went to cambodia set up .PERIOD This school that we had built ,COMMA just as the school connected it to the internet .PERIOD 
I can see any head of state ,COMMA any executive i want ,COMMA at any time .PERIOD Because i'm not selling laptops .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK I have no shareholders .PERIOD 
If you look at our professional services ,COMMA including search firms ,COMMA including communications ,COMMA including legal services ,COMMA including banking ,COMMA they're all pro bono .PERIOD And it's not to save money .PERIOD 
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic .PERIOD

If you're in a desert ,COMMA they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .PERIOD 
Use your mailing lists .PERIOD People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .PERIOD 
And the world production today ,COMMA everybody combined ,COMMA making laptops .PERIOD Is five million a month .PERIOD So i'm standing here telling you that sometime next year ,COMMA we're going to make <NUM> percent of the world production .PERIOD 
Computers sort of came around through games and toys .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong ,COMMA a little microprocessor embedded and then other games that came after that .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA there's <NUM> million of them sold worldwide .PERIOD 
Don't .PERIOD Worry .PERIOD Relax ,COMMA no ,COMMA relax .PERIOD It's a robot .PERIOD It's smart .PERIOD 
It can withstand a 400g shock .PERIOD The robot has local intelligence .PERIOD It can flip itself .PERIOD Over .PERIOD Can get itself into communication range .PERIOD Can go upstairs by itself ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD 
We had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening .PERIOD 
So one year ago ,COMMA the us .PERIOD Military didn't have these robots .PERIOD 
He sort of does that ,COMMA but i'm going to -- chris anderson :COLON i'm just british rb :COLON oh .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA he's pretty good .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD Good .PERIOD Good .PERIOD

Kismet :COLON do you really think so ?QUESTIONMARK Do you really think so .PERIOD 
Voice look at my smile .PERIOD 
Voice :COLON no ,COMMA no ,COMMA you're not to do that .PERIOD No .PERIOD 
We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- notice the turn-taking .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us .PERIOD 
And for those of you that have teenagers ,COMMA you know what that's like .PERIOD 
And i don't think -- -- i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with .PERIOD 
And the watchmaker turned around and said ,COMMA god can see it .PERIOD 
But i felt something .PERIOD 
Now you probably know the answer to this already .PERIOD 
I remember it clearly .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA what the hell's that about .PERIOD 
Now i'm not a neuroscientist .PERIOD 
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know ,COMMA or what we're going to learn about something .PERIOD 
And as we assemble these tools ,COMMA from a design point of view ,COMMA i get terribly excited about it .PERIOD Because these are things ,COMMA as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain .PERIOD It would seem before cognition ,COMMA before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces .PERIOD And what have you .PERIOD 
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow .PERIOD 
Anais nin .PERIOD And the talmud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are .PERIOD But as we are .PERIOD 
Ahhhh .PERIOD 
But i also know why it's exquisite to me ,COMMA because it's a palimpsest of things .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects .PERIOD And that does it consummately well ,COMMA you can see it can .PERIOD 
Why would you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Beautiful maybe lesser .PERIOD 
Underneath this ,COMMA like the story of the swan ,COMMA is a million things very difficult to do .PERIOD 
So all hail to that .PERIOD 
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside ,COMMA the stuff that costs nothing ,COMMA because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together .PERIOD And where do we come out .PERIOD 
And so i've stopped using words like form ,COMMA and i've stopped using words like function as a designer .PERIOD 
And for the last decade or so ,COMMA it's been quite clear .PERIOD What being an atheist means .PERIOD 
Now i think it's too easy .PERIOD 
And what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like a new version of atheism ,COMMA we could call atheism <NUM> .PERIOD 
I really like the art of mantegna .PERIOD 
I think there is an alternative .PERIOD 
We have secularized badly ,COMMA i would argue .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the kind of thing a commencement address is .PERIOD And graduation ceremonies ,COMMA those lyrical claims that education ,COMMA the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .PERIOD 
We need data .PERIOD We don't need help .PERIOD 
And so we need guidance ,COMMA and we need didactic learning .PERIOD 
They'd go ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD I don't need one of those .PERIOD 
Well a sermon wants to change your life ,COMMA and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .PERIOD 
Otherwise ,COMMA our minds are like sieves .PERIOD 
We associate repetition with boredom .PERIOD 
We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times ,COMMA because they're so true .PERIOD 
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .PERIOD 
All the major religions give us calendars .PERIOD 
You won't do that by accident .PERIOD You will do that because you are guided to do that .PERIOD 
In the secular world ,COMMA we think if an idea is important ,COMMA i'll bump into it .PERIOD 
That's very good .PERIOD 
In the secular world ,COMMA you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker ,COMMA and still have a great career .PERIOD 
What you're saying :COLON needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .PERIOD 
After every convincing point ,COMMA people will go ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen .PERIOD 
At the end of a really rousing paragraph ,COMMA they'll all stand up and they'll go ,COMMA thank you jesus .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD Christ .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD Savior .PERIOD 
Religions are fascinating in the way they try ,COMMA and combine the two .PERIOD 
We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches .PERIOD 
Art is about two things in all the major faiths .PERIOD 
And if that thing is good ,COMMA there's no problem with it at all .PERIOD 
Art should be didactic .PERIOD 
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists ,COMMA the poets -- are on their own and they have no power ,COMMA they have no might .PERIOD 
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience ,COMMA of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are .PERIOD 
Is there any room for that experience in atheism ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
I would say that there are many ,COMMA many gaps in secular life .PERIOD And these can be plugged .PERIOD 
And as it happened ,COMMA i read it from midnight to five in the morning .PERIOD In one shot .PERIOD 
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world .PERIOD 
There is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly .PERIOD 
When a neutrino hits a water molecule ,COMMA it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light .PERIOD And by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino .PERIOD 
But nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering .PERIOD 
Here's another view of the same .PERIOD 
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert .PERIOD 
And remember ,COMMA all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold ,COMMA in sub-zero temperatures .PERIOD 
They're wearing about <NUM> kg ,COMMA of clothing and stuff .PERIOD But they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .PERIOD 
Anil ananthaswamy .PERIOD And i'll finally like to leave you with two images .PERIOD 
They're going to learn from whatever it is .PERIOD They have around them .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA by far and away the largest print library in the world .PERIOD 
Then the question is :COLON what do you get .PERIOD 
It's starting to be a little bit more specified .PERIOD 
But i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like .PERIOD 
And it turns out to not be very hard .PERIOD 
You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page ,COMMA sort of the parts cost for doing this .PERIOD 
And so we've tried that ,COMMA and i'll go over that in a moment .PERIOD 
And it's called the espresso book machine .PERIOD And in about <NUM> minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book .PERIOD 
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop .PERIOD 
If you really care about books you're going to scan them better .PERIOD Especially if they're valuable books .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD 
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works .PERIOD But loaning them .PERIOD 
But it is within our grasp ,COMMA technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright ,COMMA we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing .PERIOD Online .PERIOD 
It's sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen .PERIOD 
It's about a petabyte ,COMMA so far of worldwide ,COMMA television -- russian chinese ,COMMA japanese iraqi .PERIOD Al jazeera ,COMMA bbc .PERIOD Cnn .PERIOD Abc cbs :COLON nbc -- <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD 
So we've got about <NUM> pieces up there .PERIOD 
And actually ,COMMA it's really been pioneered by alexa internet ,COMMA which donates this collection to the internet archive .PERIOD 
If we go and put it in a couple more places ,COMMA i think we'll be in good shape .PERIOD 
You'll eat countless gourmet meals .PERIOD 
Not likely .PERIOD 
And this and then this .PERIOD 
Day ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA day ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA day .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria .PERIOD And so our best antibiotics come from fungi .PERIOD 
How is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
The tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet .PERIOD 
The earth was struck by an asteroid .PERIOD A huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
We were involved with several experiments .PERIOD 
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste .PERIOD One was a control pile ;SEMICOLON one pile was treated with enzymes .PERIOD One pile was treated with bacteria .PERIOD And our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium .PERIOD 
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds .PERIOD 
So i invented burlap sacks ,COMMA bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris .PERIOD You can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e ,COMMA coli ,COMMA or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins .PERIOD And it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD 
There's more than a <NUM> million colonies per gram and <NUM> to the third power ,COMMA is around <NUM> .PERIOD 
In <NUM> hours to <NUM> hours ,COMMA these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria <NUM> times .PERIOD 
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .PERIOD 
So this one mushroom ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA has drawn our interest over time .PERIOD 
And a few years ago we received these results .PERIOD 
<NUM> or greater are considered to be very active .PERIOD 
And so for the first time ,COMMA i am showing this .PERIOD 
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i went to the epa homepage ,COMMA and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites .PERIOD 
The life box -- you're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil ,COMMA you add water .PERIOD You have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores ,COMMA like of the agarikon mushroom .PERIOD 
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium .PERIOD 
I've also lived in biosphere <NUM> .PERIOD 
Well in <NUM> ,COMMA it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .PERIOD 
The day i walked into biosphere <NUM> i was ,COMMA for the first time breathing ,COMMA a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world except seven other people .PERIOD 
We were taking their biomass ,COMMA storing them in the basement ,COMMA growing plants ,COMMA going around ,COMMA around ,COMMA around ,COMMA trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
And we had no clue where it was .PERIOD 
And that you literally do that you stop breathing .PERIOD And then you -- -- take a breath and it wakes you up .PERIOD And it's very irritating .PERIOD 
And i recoiled ,COMMA they stank .PERIOD 
People !EXCLAMATIONMARK Stink .PERIOD 
I had no idea what was in my food ,COMMA where it came from .PERIOD 
And so we sent one onto the mir space station .PERIOD 
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth .PERIOD Frankly ,COMMA from an environmental point of view .PERIOD 
And understand its interactions with the entire earth .PERIOD 
Now it may not seem like it ,COMMA but we are .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
What i'd like you to do is just really quickly ,COMMA is just sort of ,COMMA nod to the person on your right ,COMMA and then nod to the person on your left .PERIOD 
And one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this ,COMMA two months after i was here described this not as beehives but as a graveyard ,COMMA with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD 
It was called that because a guy in israel ,COMMA first found it .PERIOD And he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease .PERIOD Because of course ,COMMA there's the implication .PERIOD 
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on .PERIOD He was so capable ,COMMA he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung .PERIOD Tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening ,COMMA right in this meadow .PERIOD And so that ingenuity is inspiring .PERIOD 
And we see these families ,COMMA these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son father to son .PERIOD And these guys are hurting .PERIOD 
We have bumblebees on the top .PERIOD 
Dennis .PERIOD Vanengelsdorp ,COMMA bee .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared .PERIOD And on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites ,COMMA but also these bumblebees .PERIOD 
There are other animals that pollinate ,COMMA like bats .PERIOD And bats are in trouble too .PERIOD 
But i'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions .PERIOD And that cause is ndd .PERIOD Nature deficit disorder .PERIOD 
And that is make meadows ,COMMA and not lawns .PERIOD 
Now not all of us have meadows ,COMMA or lawns that we can convert .PERIOD And so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot .PERIOD 
And everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing incredible thing .PERIOD 
And if we want to cure ourselves of ndd or nature deficit disorder ,COMMA i think this is a great way of doing it .PERIOD 
She googled .PERIOD And she found this world ,COMMA whistling championship in america ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA i'm not the only one whistling here .PERIOD

But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark .PERIOD That's not reported here .PERIOD 
So now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently ,COMMA or at least for a very long period .PERIOD And no one is taking care of plants .PERIOD 
Why .PERIOD 
This is not the common man .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA know ,COMMA very well about professors .PERIOD 
When he speaks about animals ,COMMA [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist .PERIOD 
The blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong completely wrong .PERIOD 
Some of them are much more sophisticated .PERIOD 
Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ;SEMICOLON even birds reptiles .PERIOD And mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD 
This is a serious business .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here .PERIOD Depicted in blue -- that is called the transition zone .PERIOD 
Now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature .PERIOD But we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant ,COMMA like a plant of rye .PERIOD 
They work in the same way .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds .PERIOD 
But if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory ,COMMA to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .PERIOD 
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
She's being filmed with a hidden camera .PERIOD

It ,COMMA doesn't require any special training .PERIOD 
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal .PERIOD 
They have become domesticated ,COMMA and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .PERIOD

And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions .PERIOD 
And as with the cow ,COMMA there's a mixture of evolutionary design .PERIOD Designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions .PERIOD 
It's like a coin flip .PERIOD It doesn't count really .PERIOD 
Is it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic .PERIOD 
I know many .PERIOD Religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children ,COMMA that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .PERIOD 
This picture ,COMMA which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left ,COMMA is really an important part of this picture .PERIOD 
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep ,COMMA at all .PERIOD 
If you understand orgel's second rule ,COMMA then you understand why ?QUESTIONMARK The intelligent design movement is basically a hoax .PERIOD 
Again and again ,COMMA biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered .PERIOD

Well it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce .PERIOD 
The key to our domination of the planet is culture ,COMMA and the key to culture is religion .PERIOD 
They'd want to know how it originated ,COMMA what it was for ,COMMA and how it perpetuates itself .PERIOD 
In that case ,COMMA a parasite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .PERIOD 
But i'm not just talking about islam .PERIOD 
I'm talking also about christianity .PERIOD 
You've all got a copy .PERIOD

That's worth mentioning .PERIOD 
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose ,COMMA or meaning ,COMMA or significance .PERIOD

There are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD 
It's everywhere it's all around you ,COMMA and the space is wobbling chaotically .PERIOD 
Imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes ,COMMA collided .PERIOD 
If it was the big bang ,COMMA we were going to pick up .PERIOD It would sound like this .PERIOD 
And if we pick it up ,COMMA it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe .PERIOD 
And our prison system itself is stuck .PERIOD 
Funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining .PERIOD So this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .PERIOD 
We give science lectures .PERIOD And the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .PERIOD 
We partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek ,COMMA correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state .PERIOD 
And just recently ,COMMA we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .PERIOD 
And so what we see ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that small ,COMMA collective movements of change ,COMMA can perhaps move an entity ,COMMA such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .PERIOD 
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child .PERIOD 
That implies a lot of trust .PERIOD 
As the child grows ,COMMA it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust .PERIOD 
You can be compassionate .PERIOD Occasionally ,COMMA more moved by empathy than by compassion .PERIOD 
The tennis ;SEMICOLON etiquette is :COLON both ;SEMICOLON the players have to come to the net and shake hands .PERIOD 
Compassion is not defined in one form .PERIOD 
That means the whole universe known things and unknown things .PERIOD 
There's no choice in this .PERIOD That only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different .PERIOD From you cannot be minus you .PERIOD 
You express yourself because you have compassion .PERIOD 
There is no shortcut .PERIOD It is like swimming by swimming .PERIOD 
That's interesting to me .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA fake it and make it .PERIOD 
If you know how to pray ,COMMA pray .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses .PERIOD 
Therefore we don't find the moral ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA psychological and political space to distance ourselves ,COMMA from the reality of social responsibility .PERIOD 
Oddly enough ,COMMA an artist such as myself finds herself ,COMMA also in the position of being the voice .PERIOD The speaker of my people ,COMMA even if i have indeed no access to my own country .PERIOD 
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .PERIOD 
I envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression .PERIOD 
Our people depend on our artists ,COMMA and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD 
I work in morocco in turkey in mexico .PERIOD 
How to tell a political story ,COMMA but an allegorical story .PERIOD 
What was most significant for me was ,COMMA once again ,COMMA the presence of the women .PERIOD 
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells .PERIOD 
We have a million students a month using the site ,COMMA watching on the order of <NUM> to <NUM> videos a day .PERIOD 
And then in a response to that same comment -- this is on the thread .PERIOD 
But the paradigm here is we'll generate as many questions as you need ,COMMA until you get that concept until you get <NUM> in a row .PERIOD 
In a traditional classroom ,COMMA you have a couple of homework ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam .PERIOD 
But as ridiculous as that sounds ,COMMA that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms right now .PERIOD 
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map you have logic .PERIOD You have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics ,COMMA all based off of that core of if you know this and that now you're ready for this next concept .PERIOD 
It'll change what happens at the dinner table .PERIOD 
Green means the student's already proficient .PERIOD 
And the data gets pretty granular .PERIOD So you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD 
And so the same kids that you thought were slow .PERIOD Six weeks ago you now would think are gifted .PERIOD 
And i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom .PERIOD 
I'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software .PERIOD 
And they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD 
And they're literally saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA this is nice ,COMMA but like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it's all there .PERIOD 
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .PERIOD 
So i am going to be talking about hallucinations ,COMMA and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .PERIOD 
Animals too .PERIOD 
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA it's got color .PERIOD It's got motion .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .PERIOD 
And you have charles bonnet syndrome .PERIOD 
And about <NUM> percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD 
Now with the original description in the 18th century ,COMMA charles bonnet did not have them .PERIOD 
On one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe ,COMMA and realized it was himself .PERIOD 
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen .PERIOD 
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces .PERIOD And as with rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed with very large teeth ,COMMA or very large eyes .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things ,COMMA you're going mad .PERIOD But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i've more or less said what i wanted .PERIOD 
But they stop there .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which i ignore .PERIOD 
They occasionally interest me ,COMMA and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks .PERIOD 
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .PERIOD 
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon ,COMMA called bioluminescence .PERIOD 
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .PERIOD 
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .PERIOD 
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate :COLON a single-celled alga .PERIOD 
There's a lot of animals that use this trick .PERIOD For example ,COMMA this black dragonfish .PERIOD 
It's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD 
It's a scream for help .PERIOD It's meant to attract attention .PERIOD 
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light .PERIOD 
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .PERIOD 
This is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush .PERIOD 
We're talking to something .PERIOD 
But he's persistent .PERIOD 
We need more eyes on the process .PERIOD 
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .PERIOD 
In the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got this yellow-green area .PERIOD 
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .PERIOD 
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs ,COMMA and then carry it to other parts of the body .PERIOD 
And that's how i really began .PERIOD So let's begin .PERIOD 
Those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the <NUM> genes ,COMMA you've got written in your dna .PERIOD 
But they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells as you're about to see .PERIOD Most ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA when dna is being copied .PERIOD 
And so what i'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least <NUM> biology .PERIOD 
And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules ,COMMA which i've stripped away .PERIOD So you can see something .PERIOD 
But in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of dna is about <NUM> to <NUM> million nanometers long .PERIOD 
It is made up of about <NUM> different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total .PERIOD 
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .PERIOD 
This is how you work at the molecular scale .PERIOD 
And we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems .PERIOD It only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD 
So that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA we can't know ,COMMA but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved .PERIOD 
We saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the protestant reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them :COLON the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy ,COMMA of the commons .PERIOD 
Garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s .PERIOD 
And most recently ,COMMA neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain .PERIOD 
Jim :COLON surowiecki :COLON briefly :COLON mentioned yochai .PERIOD Benkler's :COLON paper about open source pointing to a new form of production :COLON peer-to-peer production .PERIOD 
Toyota :COLON instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD 
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,COMMA but i think we can begin to think about them .PERIOD 
I believe that the payoff would be very big .PERIOD 
What forms of suffering could be alleviated ,COMMA what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen .PERIOD It's going to require effort .PERIOD 
I'm not going to dive into them either .PERIOD But photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD 
So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live .PERIOD And this is really truly ,COMMA very frightening .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA the other way .PERIOD 
This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time .PERIOD If we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times .PERIOD And we can get all of this very detailed information about different times .PERIOD Different dates :COLON let's move the moon a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change .PERIOD The date .PERIOD 
All right now ,COMMA i've overrun my time ,COMMA so i've got to stop .PERIOD 
Sophal ear .PERIOD So notwithstanding the 1970s .PERIOD Narration :COLON on april 17th .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD We lived in phnom penh .PERIOD 
They were young soldiers .PERIOD Typically child soldiers .PERIOD 
So the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from vietnam .PERIOD 
And we end up in hong ngu ,COMMA on the vietnamese side .PERIOD 
And then onwards to chau doc .PERIOD 
Thank you mother .PERIOD 
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .PERIOD 
And one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul ,COMMA and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan .PERIOD 
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted .PERIOD And we had <NUM> all over kabul .PERIOD 
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD 
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future .PERIOD 
Child there is no difference here between classes nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not .PERIOD 
Simply if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in you share with us and make music .PERIOD 
In its essence ,COMMA the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures .PERIOD 
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD 
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .PERIOD 
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home .PERIOD While her mother does the housework .PERIOD 
And these will be some simple design qualities ,COMMA and they will also be some qualities of if you will ,COMMA the intelligence of interaction .PERIOD 
Now we've put people <NUM> inches in front of a tv and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA are staring you in the face :COLON the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines ,COMMA all of that .PERIOD 
And my favorite example is always fingers .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they're not .PERIOD It's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input medium -- you have to just do it twice ;SEMICOLON you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .PERIOD 
And we have never known how to do this technically .PERIOD So this slide is a fake slide .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation .PERIOD 
The person's just ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA pushing on the screen to make a curve .PERIOD 
And what you can do -- oops .PERIOD I didn't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties .PERIOD 
What i'll show you very quickly ,COMMA is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind .PERIOD 
So it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information .PERIOD In the medium itself ,COMMA it's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD 
Now that would be if you will .PERIOD The top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much ,COMMA but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn't an expert ,COMMA and say ,COMMA cook at <NUM> degrees for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA well ,COMMA reading is this junk .PERIOD They give me in little books to read .PERIOD 
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar ,COMMA but wow .PERIOD The key to the future of computers in education is right there .PERIOD And it is :COLON when does it mean something to a child .PERIOD 
What the truth is ,COMMA is that speaking has great value to a child .PERIOD The child can get a great deal by talking to you .PERIOD 
Well in senegal ,COMMA we found that this was the traditional classroom .PERIOD <NUM> kids -- three per desk -- one teacher :COLON a little bit of chalk .PERIOD 
That's what meant something to her is doing the hair pattern ,COMMA and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was to her .PERIOD Absolutely the most meaningful piece .PERIOD 
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom i see in the room ,COMMA can imagine what it will be .PERIOD 
Now that is sufficiently zany that we would ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA jump to the bait .PERIOD And we did .PERIOD 
So if i all of a sudden turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other .PERIOD 
And then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn .PERIOD 
We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications .PERIOD 
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time ,COMMA down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend .PERIOD And we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk ,COMMA where they're like ,COMMA wait ,COMMA who is this ,COMMA oh ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
So sensors are looking at that kind of voice .PERIOD 
If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience .PERIOD 
This is <NUM> tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,COMMA but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it ,COMMA and do something about it .PERIOD We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe and react ,COMMA as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD 
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive healthcare systems actually began in <NUM> .PERIOD 
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .PERIOD 
How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data ,COMMA psychological data ,COMMA relational data ,COMMA in and on and around the home .PERIOD 
They fixed her back up ,COMMA she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD They put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD 
I'm not bragging about how much we fund ;SEMICOLON it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home .PERIOD 
And so that's what i've been striving for .PERIOD All of my life .PERIOD 
But instead ,COMMA i go out and i find things .PERIOD 
Then i just pick things up .PERIOD 
And so at that time i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues .PERIOD 
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals .PERIOD 
In social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults .PERIOD 
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it wasn't dna .PERIOD She didn't find dna .PERIOD 
We gave samples to mary schweitzer ,COMMA and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .PERIOD 
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer ,COMMA and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it was wonderful stuff .PERIOD 
So that's what i'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD 
We started out with a wolf-like creature .PERIOD And we ended up with a maltese .PERIOD 
And so that's what we're looking into .PERIOD 
Archaeopteryx which is a bird ,COMMA a primitive bird .PERIOD Still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD 
It has the three fingers .PERIOD The three digits .PERIOD 
Birds have basically rudimentary tails .PERIOD 
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail ,COMMA gets rid of it .PERIOD 
And people always say ,COMMA why do that .PERIOD 
What the frigoris you doing ?QUESTIONMARK Names are important .PERIOD 
Now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus .PERIOD 
Listen :COLON i'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD Can you call me in a little while .PERIOD 
So these are actual names of people that work there .PERIOD 
I did some more investigation .PERIOD 
There are some mapping .PERIOD People who do use their names .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA formulas ,COMMA relate number to form .PERIOD 
They got little babies in there ,COMMA floating in there .PERIOD 
It's a different kind ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and they've got five apples .PERIOD 
Because that's why we're here really ,COMMA i think ,COMMA to figure stuff out and to love each other .PERIOD 
They are so different .PERIOD 
Bode's .PERIOD Law wasn't even his law .PERIOD It was a guy named titus .PERIOD 
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted .PERIOD 
Golden section .PERIOD I've been obsessed with this thing since before .PERIOD I was born .PERIOD 
I know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely .PERIOD 
If fibonacci had been on paxil ,COMMA that would be the fibonacci series .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA mama .PERIOD 
There is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there now .PERIOD Because you would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA go back to the fluctus part .PERIOD 
And i'm presenting it here at ted .PERIOD Why .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA just seems like it's not sexy and elegant .PERIOD It's hidden .PERIOD 
And look at this built within it .PERIOD Is the golden ratio .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Good afternoon .PERIOD 
In <NUM> .PERIOD In the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of <NUM> kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb .PERIOD 
And with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside centcom's systems to see and hear everything and maybe even infect some of them .PERIOD 
As a result ,COMMA the americans take the threat .PERIOD Very seriously .PERIOD 
I'll quote general james ,COMMA cartwright vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who says in a report to congress ,COMMA that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD 
Moreover ,COMMA the americans have decided to spend over <NUM> billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities .PERIOD 
Cyber :COLON weapons have this peculiar feature .PERIOD They can be used without leaving traces .PERIOD 
Cartoons ,COMMA are basically short stories .PERIOD 
And that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land .PERIOD But when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint .PERIOD 
And best of all i saw the animals .PERIOD 
Could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that .PERIOD 
It would start a whole new space race .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA take these sea turtles .PERIOD 
They kind of have a sixth sense like superman's x-ray ,COMMA vision .PERIOD 
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth .PERIOD 
Or take this sea cucumber .PERIOD 
He's sort of a homer simpson with fins .PERIOD 
He goes down ,COMMA and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD 
The third storyline i did about a year ,COMMA and a half ago ,COMMA was probably my most difficult .PERIOD 
I do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue .PERIOD 
There was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins .PERIOD So i kind of exposed that .PERIOD 
And you see ,COMMA you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster .PERIOD 
So you say to yourself ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's worth something .PERIOD 
So you go back into the room and you break this thing to pieces and you haul it away .PERIOD 
Thanks for listening .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
Woman ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD 
<NUM> :COLON let's give three of them a nice round of applause there .PERIOD 
What i'm going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that .PERIOD 
In the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .PERIOD 
Really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please .PERIOD 
For my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries ,COMMA i have one more question for the audience .PERIOD 
Let's see starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first ,COMMA ok ,COMMA sir ?QUESTIONMARK What year was it ?QUESTIONMARK First of all ,COMMA that's why i start with a gentleman first .PERIOD 
Yell ,COMMA it out ,COMMA what year ?QUESTIONMARK Audience :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA ok -- and the month .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON may .PERIOD Ab :COLON may ,COMMA what .PERIOD 
It was ab :COLON and it was cloudy .PERIOD 
<NUM> squared ,COMMA yuck .PERIOD 
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts .PERIOD 
I'll do <NUM> squared ,COMMA plus <NUM> squared ,COMMA plus <NUM> times <NUM> times two .PERIOD 
While i explain something else -- -- i know that you can use right .PERIOD 
That seems right .PERIOD I'll go on cookie fission ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
A third time ,COMMA it's just being a technician .PERIOD 
So i'm not going to talk about that .PERIOD 
Get them out of schools and keep them out of schools .PERIOD 
Having said that ,COMMA i outlined my talk about five minutes ago .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in <NUM> years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher .PERIOD 
But to me ,COMMA things aren't the future .PERIOD 
Right away .PERIOD I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .PERIOD 
This is a klein bottle .PERIOD 
It's one sided :COLON it's a bottle .PERIOD Whose inside is its outside .PERIOD 
It has zero volume ,COMMA and it's non-orientable .PERIOD 
It has wonderful properties .PERIOD 
That was a month of my life .PERIOD 
Oh cool .PERIOD I can get to this place over here ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I take lunch hour .PERIOD 
One of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them .PERIOD Look ,COMMA i'm going to teach you college-level physics .PERIOD 
Is a constant when the frequency goes up .PERIOD The wavelength comes down ,COMMA wavelength goes up .PERIOD Frequency goes down .PERIOD So ,COMMA if we have a wave here -- over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up ,COMMA things get closer ,COMMA pitch goes down ,COMMA things stretch out .PERIOD 
Now so i know the frequency .PERIOD 
Those of you who are physicists ,COMMA i hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me .PERIOD 
It's one of these bell-tower buildings .PERIOD 
I keep climbing up ,COMMA go back .PERIOD 
A dome ,COMMA one of these ten-foot domes .PERIOD 
In this light may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind ,COMMA from darkness to light ,COMMA from narrowness to broad-mindedness ,COMMA from prejudice to tolerance .PERIOD 
It's time for me to let it go .PERIOD 
We want space efficiency .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet .PERIOD A dining table becomes a bed -- same space ,COMMA a little side table stretches out to seat <NUM> .PERIOD 
Guests :COLON move the moving wall .PERIOD Have some fold-down guest beds .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Seriously ,COMMA but dangerously fun .PERIOD 
And there it is ,COMMA and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard ,COMMA then .PERIOD 
So i'm gonna take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence .PERIOD 
Any of you who've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you .PERIOD There is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble .PERIOD 
And this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no claws extended ,COMMA no fangs taking a look .PERIOD 
And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD 
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD 
And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature .PERIOD That's within all of us .PERIOD 
John mentioned that i've done some work with murderers .PERIOD And i have .PERIOD 
If you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this ,COMMA jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around -- you're going to feel better .PERIOD 
But it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD 
But if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky :COLON no claws ,COMMA flat fur ,COMMA soft eyes ,COMMA open mouth with no fangs ,COMMA balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements -- all specific to play .PERIOD 
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD 
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD 
I think that -- that's a few years back -- i think that wave is past ,COMMA and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the program says that the opposite of play is not work .PERIOD It's depression .PERIOD 
Nobody misses that dog .PERIOD I took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD 
You may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name .PERIOD And last name .PERIOD 
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different .PERIOD 
And looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed .PERIOD 
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington ,COMMA dc .PERIOD 
Most of us work with groups .PERIOD And i put this up because the dschool ,COMMA the design school at stanford .PERIOD Thanks to david kelley ,COMMA and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation .PERIOD 
So what will follow is a student-made film about just that .PERIOD 
But it doesn't have to be that way .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do ,COMMA and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be .PERIOD If they hadn't played .PERIOD 
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically ,COMMA animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory ,COMMA and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams .PERIOD 
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation ,COMMA national institute of mental health ,COMMA or anybody else to really look at it in this way .PERIOD Seriously .PERIOD 
So our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice .PERIOD So here ,COMMA we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish ,COMMA and then basically served that picture with the dish .PERIOD 
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin ,COMMA a naturally occurring thing ,COMMA it still freaks me out every time i eat it .PERIOD But it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue .PERIOD So that primarily sour taste receptors .PERIOD So normally things that would taste very sour or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet .PERIOD 
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment ,COMMA it doesn't matter .PERIOD 
Aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus ,COMMA in nairobi ,COMMA new delhi and mumbai ,COMMA there are no network news bureaus in all of africa ,COMMA india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD 
And can we afford not to thank you .PERIOD 
At this time there were thousands of individuals ,COMMA we think that were infected with hiv .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA now more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the '40s and '50s ,COMMA '60s .PERIOD Had we seen this disease .PERIOD Had we understood exactly what was going on with it .PERIOD How might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way ?QUESTIONMARK This pandemic moved .PERIOD 
Nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very ,COMMA very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of hiv .PERIOD 
So during the last <NUM> years ,COMMA i've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON deep ,COMMA in a remote region of cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey .PERIOD 
A group of hunters approach ,COMMA their packs loaded with wild game .PERIOD 
This is challenging work to do .PERIOD 
But -- when he began to speak ,COMMA they would actually recognize his voice from the radio .PERIOD 
So what happened ?QUESTIONMARK So ,COMMA during the <NUM> years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves .PERIOD 
We made a number of discoveries .PERIOD 
It's something we should be following .PERIOD It's not something that we should be surprised by .PERIOD 
So it's not just hunters in central africa .PERIOD 
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone ,COMMA which my friends and i are doing now ,COMMA is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for .PERIOD 
If you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical .PERIOD 
Because this is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA the first way that people discover their own potential as actors ,COMMA and discover their own agency .PERIOD 
By saying ,COMMA who ?QUESTIONMARK Is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK Oh .PERIOD It's actually me .PERIOD 
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood .PERIOD 
And so whereas dr .PERIOD Oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes .PERIOD And things like this ,COMMA phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent .PERIOD 
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA they don't imagine the person in the booth ,COMMA typing it all .PERIOD 
And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away .PERIOD How these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you're interested in ,COMMA and where your attention is directed .PERIOD 
And so i've been beginning with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes .PERIOD 
In the first one which i'm going to show you called eyecode .PERIOD It's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD 
But if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop ,COMMA then you'll see these nice crisp eyes .PERIOD 
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes .PERIOD 
And this exists in larger installations where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at .PERIOD As you see who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them .PERIOD 
Checking him out .PERIOD 
You say ,COMMA what you're doing in <NUM> characters or less and people who are interested in .PERIOD You get those updates .PERIOD 
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening .PERIOD That lets people feel more connected and in touch despite distance and in real time .PERIOD 
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago .PERIOD When there was a gas shortage in atlanta .PERIOD 
It's happened ,COMMA more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa ,COMMA or for a family in crisis .PERIOD 
Evan williams .PERIOD Nice .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD 
And i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD 
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books ,COMMA i read drank ginger beer .PERIOD 
I realized that people like me girls with skin the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails ,COMMA could also exist in literature .PERIOD 
But the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature .PERIOD 
So what the discovery of african writers did for me ,COMMA was this it saved me from having a single story of what books are .PERIOD 
So i felt enormous pity ,COMMA for fide's family .PERIOD 
If i had not grown up in nigeria ,COMMA and if all i knew about africa were from popular images ,COMMA i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes :COLON beautiful animals ,COMMA and incomprehensible people ,COMMA fighting senseless wars ,COMMA dying of poverty and aids ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind ,COMMA white foreigner .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i've laughed every time i've read this .PERIOD 
So that is how to create a single story ,COMMA show a people as one thing ,COMMA as only one thing over and over again .PERIOD And that is what they become .PERIOD 
My cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .PERIOD 
What the nigerian writer chinua ,COMMA achebe calls a balance of stories .PERIOD 
What if my roommate knew about my nigerian publisher ,COMMA mukta bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man ?QUESTIONMARK Who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house .PERIOD 
He disagreed .PERIOD He felt that people who could read ,COMMA would read .PERIOD If you made literature affordable and available to them .PERIOD 
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer ,COMMA who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge ,COMMA a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports ?QUESTIONMARK 
Stories matter .PERIOD 
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives ,COMMA and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD 
We've surrendered our power ,COMMA trading off our discomfort with uncertainty ,COMMA for the illusion of certainty that they provide .PERIOD 
It literally flat-lined .PERIOD 
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps ,COMMA that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition ,COMMA that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD 
A recent study in the archives of surgery ,COMMA reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries ,COMMA operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow ,COMMA eye ,COMMA foot ,COMMA and also mistakes born out of thinking errors .PERIOD 
Why was it that when i had an operation ,COMMA my doctor said to me beware .PERIOD Ms .PERIOD Hertz of hyperpyrexia when he could have just as easily said ,COMMA watch out for a high fever .PERIOD 
You see being ready to take experts on ,COMMA is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies ,COMMA and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like ,COMMA what are the assumptions that underpin this .PERIOD 
If we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out ,COMMA in which we're bringing in new ,COMMA diverse ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views into the discussion ,COMMA fearlessly ,COMMA in the knowledge that progress comes about ,COMMA not only from the creation of ideas ,COMMA but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that ,COMMA by surrounding ourselves by divergent ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views .PERIOD 
Google ceo ,COMMA eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy .PERIOD 
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace ,COMMA the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo's ,COMMA but also shop-girls -- yeah .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And so the thought that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science ?QUESTIONMARK We know today -- no time ,COMMA for science fair ,COMMA no time for playing around with things ,COMMA or waiting for the magic battery to show up .PERIOD 
First component is you charge the car ?QUESTIONMARK Whenever you stop -- ends up that ?QUESTIONMARK Cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
Now that last mile last foot ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is the first step of the infrastructure .PERIOD 
What we found out when you move from molecules to electrons .PERIOD Something interesting happens .PERIOD 
We have a battery bay .PERIOD It costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .PERIOD 
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we're in in the us .PERIOD 
That's a new economic factor ,COMMA which is fascinating to most people .PERIOD 
So we went out and we looked at all the car companies .PERIOD 
And i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place .PERIOD 
We decided to come into the us .PERIOD 
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .PERIOD 
By <NUM> we would have had at least <NUM> million new cars ,COMMA even at the pace .PERIOD We're going at right now .PERIOD 
And then we do the opec stimulus package also known as <NUM> dollars a barrel .PERIOD 
And that's the difference between problems that are additive ,COMMA like co2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up ,COMMA and then we tip ,COMMA and problems that are depletive ,COMMA in which we lose what we have ,COMMA which oscillate .PERIOD And they oscillate until we lose everything .PERIOD We've got .PERIOD 
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars .PERIOD 
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills .PERIOD 
That's one percent a year .PERIOD 
And when we go to cop15 at the end of this year ,COMMA we can't stop thinking of padding co2 .PERIOD 
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .PERIOD 
And there will be about a <NUM> percent chance .PERIOD We'll recover him .PERIOD 
We have to make it immediately .PERIOD 
And we need to do it not within <NUM> years or <NUM> years ,COMMA but within this presidential term because if we don't ,COMMA we will lose our economy ,COMMA right after we'd lost our morality .PERIOD 
They see us as rocking the boat ,COMMA and you can understand why .PERIOD 
Now it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism .PERIOD And i want to reassure you that that's not what i'm going to do .PERIOD 
Essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .PERIOD 
It turns out to be ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're used to not challenging religious ideas ,COMMA and it's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates .PERIOD When he does it .PERIOD He meant me ,COMMA not that one .PERIOD 
It teaches them to accept authority revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence .PERIOD 
But suppose -- -- in <NUM> ,COMMA a reporter asked george bush ,COMMA sr .PERIOD 
Whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists .PERIOD 
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority .PERIOD But actually ,COMMA how do american atheists stack up numerically .PERIOD 
The survey that i quoted ,COMMA which is the aris survey ,COMMA didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education iq or anything ,COMMA else .PERIOD 
But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group .PERIOD Namely ,COMMA top scientists .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists ,COMMA those who'd been honored by election to the national academy of sciences .PERIOD And among this select group ,COMMA belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent .PERIOD 
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .PERIOD 
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields ,COMMA such history or philosophy ,COMMA but i'd be surprised if they were different .PERIOD 
And i've already hinted what that something is .PERIOD 
From what i've seen of ted ,COMMA i think this may be the ideal place to launch it .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA i fear ,COMMA it will cost money .PERIOD 
I suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means ,COMMA and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy ,COMMA to out themselves .PERIOD 
Hence ,COMMA the phrase tooth fairy agnostic .PERIOD 
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not .PERIOD 
But we don't bother to say ,COMMA so ,COMMA and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist .PERIOD 
When atheists ,COMMA like stephen hawking and albert einstein ?QUESTIONMARK Use the word god .PERIOD They use it .PERIOD Of course ,COMMA as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep ,COMMA mysterious part of physics ,COMMA which we don't yet understand .PERIOD 
What i want to do this morning ,COMMA is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa .PERIOD 
Already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time ,COMMA the africa of hiv/aids .PERIOD The africa of malaria ,COMMA the africa of poverty ,COMMA the africa of conflict and the africa of disasters .PERIOD 
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite .PERIOD 
Because if we can get the <NUM> billion dollars sitting out there back ,COMMA it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together .PERIOD 
One in four ,COMMA sub-saharan africans is nigerian and it has <NUM> million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people .PERIOD You'll never be bored .PERIOD 
Not the international monetary fund ,COMMA not the world bank ,COMMA where i worked for <NUM> years and rose to be a vice president .PERIOD 
You .PERIOD Couldn't get it ;SEMICOLON you had to bribe .PERIOD 
The :COLON smartest :COLON one :COLON first to come in was the mtn company of south africa .PERIOD 
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four .PERIOD Others have come in .PERIOD 
And we had gdp grow from an average of <NUM> percent ,COMMA the previous decade to about <NUM> percent .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
We consolidated them from <NUM> to <NUM> banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital .PERIOD 
In tourism ,COMMA in many african countries ,COMMA a great opportunity .PERIOD 
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries .PERIOD Not one country .PERIOD 
But imagine the impact on a family ,COMMA if the parents can be employed ,COMMA and make sure that their children go to school ,COMMA that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .PERIOD 
If we can invest in places where you yourselves ,COMMA make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet ,COMMA isn't that a wonderful opportunity ?QUESTIONMARK Isn't that the way to go .PERIOD 
Mixing african materials ,COMMA such as we have with materials from elsewhere .PERIOD 
And so to start helping that ,COMMA i want to take us back to <NUM> .PERIOD 
Four and a half million users around the world ,COMMA contributing their leftover computer cycles ,COMMA whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver .PERIOD And together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes .PERIOD 
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way ,COMMA information production and exchange is capitalized not ,COMMA that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital ,COMMA the way the capitalization happens ,COMMA is radically distributed .PERIOD Each of us in these advanced economies has one of these ,COMMA or something rather like it -- a computer .PERIOD 
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license .PERIOD They transmitted in an area ,COMMA and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property .PERIOD 
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production ,COMMA to have decentralized action in society .PERIOD That was not about society itself .PERIOD 
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact .PERIOD 
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time .PERIOD 
It's creating .PERIOD And it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .PERIOD 
Peer-to-peer :COLON networks assaulting the recording industry ;SEMICOLON free and open source software taking market share from microsoft skype ,COMMA potentially threatening traditional telecoms .PERIOD Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .PERIOD 
And you see surfers ,COMMA people who see this happening ,COMMA and in some sense ,COMMA build it into a supply chain ,COMMA which is a very curious one right ?QUESTIONMARK 
In <NUM> ,COMMA a new virus appeared that killed some <NUM> to <NUM> million people .PERIOD 
It spread like wildfire ,COMMA and some died within hours of developing symptoms .PERIOD 
When they work ,COMMA they can make history .PERIOD But after a while ,COMMA you can barely hear them .PERIOD 
Or polio ,COMMA how many of you remember the iron lung .PERIOD 
So let's explore how vaccines work .PERIOD 
When you're pre-immunized ,COMMA what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .PERIOD 
Seth berkley ,COMMA really cool .PERIOD Video .PERIOD Isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
In addition ,COMMA wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA luckily ,COMMA that particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily .PERIOD 
We've got these new antibodies ,COMMA we've identified ,COMMA and we know that they latch onto many ,COMMA many variations of the virus .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .PERIOD 
So far ,COMMA animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease .PERIOD Although you might get a mild case .PERIOD 
It was a slow ,COMMA cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living ,COMMA chicken eggs .PERIOD 
Now think of where this leads us .PERIOD 
New ,COMMA infectious diseases ,COMMA appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD 
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die .PERIOD 
You also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals .PERIOD You mix .PERIOD 
I call them the cheetah generation .PERIOD 
The :COLON cheetah .PERIOD Generation :COLON is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .PERIOD 
Now we're talking about a continent that is not poor .PERIOD 
There are people who think that we should pour more money ,COMMA more aid into this bowl ,COMMA which leaks .PERIOD 
Let's take food imports .PERIOD 
Just add that up all these leakages .PERIOD 
Kwame ,COMMA nkrumah .PERIOD Nyerere .PERIOD Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin .PERIOD 
By creating wealth .PERIOD 
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work .PERIOD 
Without the council ,COMMA the chief can't pass any law ,COMMA and if the chief doesn't govern ,COMMA according to the will of the people he will be removed .PERIOD 
So it's quite appropriate that .PERIOD This section is called a marketplace .PERIOD 
What africans practiced was a different form of capitalism ,COMMA but then after independence ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism became a western institution .PERIOD And the leaders said ,COMMA africans were ready for socialism .PERIOD 
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed .PERIOD 
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can .PERIOD 
And the journalist was asking him ,COMMA why is this so important ?QUESTIONMARK 
They disappeared .PERIOD 
But a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt and to send me screen shots of what they got .PERIOD 
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .PERIOD 
Now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane .PERIOD 
We went in and sat down at the booth .PERIOD And the waitress came over ,COMMA made a big commotion over ,COMMA tipper .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA that's former vice president al gore and his wife ,COMMA tipper .PERIOD 
It's like beachcombing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time the tide comes in and out ,COMMA you find some more shells .PERIOD 
It's an easy visible target of concern ,COMMA and it should be ,COMMA but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .PERIOD 
Insulation ,COMMA better ,COMMA design ,COMMA buy green electricity ,COMMA where you can .PERIOD 
A lot of us in here have made that decision ,COMMA and it is really pretty easy .PERIOD 
It doesn't mean that if you are a republican that i'm trying to convince you to be a democrat ,COMMA we need republicans as well .PERIOD This used to be a bipartisan issue .PERIOD And i know that in this group it really is become politically active .PERIOD 
We have to buy a lot of those ads .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA the republicans here .PERIOD This shouldn't be partisan .PERIOD 
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas ,COMMA all the fossil fuels ,COMMA have changed the atmosphere ,COMMA greatly .PERIOD 
And one of the really most incredible things i think ,COMMA is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is densest .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA people who are really shell-shocked .PERIOD 
So this is the gulf of mexico ,COMMA sparkling place ,COMMA full of fish .PERIOD 
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface .PERIOD And then it is attacked because they don't want the evidence in my opinion .PERIOD 
We heard that bacteria eat oil .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA do sea turtles .PERIOD 
When it breaks up ,COMMA it has a long way to go before .PERIOD It gets down to bacteria .PERIOD 
I heard the most incredible story today .PERIOD When i was on the train coming here .PERIOD 
That's the story of thousands of people .PERIOD 
The other thing about the gulf that is important ,COMMA is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .PERIOD 
If it's not ,COMMA it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae ,COMMA i would certainly think .PERIOD 
So while the oil spill ,COMMA the leak ,COMMA the eruption is a catastrophe ,COMMA i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean ,COMMA for a very ,COMMA very long time .PERIOD 
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with .PERIOD 
It's just ridiculous .PERIOD 
I think that this is the result of gross negligence .PERIOD 
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .PERIOD 
Your sequence and mine are slightly different .PERIOD 
I've got brown eyes you might have blue or gray .PERIOD 
I think we should say it all together .PERIOD 
And still ,COMMA you may not see the branches .PERIOD 
But seriously ,COMMA what's wrong with this .PERIOD 
You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement .PERIOD 
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you .PERIOD 
I assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD It's just six microns on a side .PERIOD 
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain .PERIOD 
I feel curiosity ,COMMA and i feel wonder ,COMMA but at times i have also felt despair .PERIOD 
Why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity ,COMMA that it might well be infinite ?QUESTIONMARK 
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions ,COMMA our mental experiences .PERIOD 
And if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD 
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .PERIOD 
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .PERIOD 
I'll give you a hint ,COMMA it's a big number .PERIOD 
Zach kaplan keith and i lead a research team .PERIOD 
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours ,COMMA he sold it to you as if it was for sale .PERIOD Right now .PERIOD 
Inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast ,COMMA so tall ,COMMA that when you hit the bottom ,COMMA it uses brakes to stop .PERIOD 
In addition ,COMMA you can see from the diagram on the right .PERIOD The underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal ,COMMA it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD But something unexpected happens .PERIOD When you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .PERIOD 
It's perfectly clear .PERIOD It's odorless ,COMMA it's colorless .PERIOD 
Shape-retaining is common in metal :COLON you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place .PERIOD Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides ,COMMA and it always bounces back .PERIOD 
So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .PERIOD 
For our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .PERIOD 
And these dyes change color in response to odors .PERIOD 
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria ,COMMA or viruses ,COMMA or even lung cancer ,COMMA the dots will change .PERIOD And they can use software to analyze the results .PERIOD 
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world .PERIOD Prior to seeing this we would have assumed :COLON a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket .PERIOD Something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense .PERIOD The way paper is being bent .PERIOD Every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's crucified .PERIOD 
Spanish ?QUESTIONMARK Chef :COLON accused of cheating .PERIOD 
A huge scandal for a few weeks .PERIOD 
That is until i went to eduardo's farm in extremadura .PERIOD <NUM> miles north of seville ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK On the portugal border .PERIOD 
I'm just here to give the geese what they want .PERIOD 
I was speaking too loudly .PERIOD 
Right up to us ,COMMA like right up to here .PERIOD 
He doesn't .PERIOD 
So he got rid of the electricity .PERIOD He got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside .PERIOD So it would protect them against coyotes and other predators .PERIOD 
Part of the income ,COMMA for his farm .PERIOD 
A big part of his income for his farm .PERIOD 
That's how i've been trained .PERIOD 
So i'm listening to all this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD And i'm like ,COMMA is this guy for real ,COMMA is he making some of this up .PERIOD 
Is he like ,COMMA you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything ,COMMA and it was always nature .PERIOD 
Because really ,COMMA they want you to look at themselves right .PERIOD 
And we're sitting there ,COMMA and i hear [clapping] from a distance .PERIOD So i look over .PERIOD 
To fly south in the winter and north ,COMMA when it gets warm .PERIOD 
And the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that you know ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA it risks hyperbole really easily .PERIOD 
I'm really in love with him at this point .PERIOD 
He takes the liver .PERIOD When he harvests the foie gras ,COMMA he sticks them in this jar .PERIOD And he confits it .PERIOD 
No salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices .PERIOD 
We went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity .PERIOD 
How come you don't give him this ?QUESTIONMARK 
I really was moved .PERIOD 
The pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .PERIOD 
And the jews ,COMMA fearing for their life ,COMMA had to come up with an ingenious idea ,COMMA or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh's wishes .PERIOD Of course .PERIOD 
One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business in liquidation .PERIOD 
Whether we're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras .PERIOD 
That is our poetry .PERIOD That is our beautiful story .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA i can see if i found something up up ,COMMA and they continue up up up .PERIOD 
You you survive ,COMMA it's ok .PERIOD 
Nobody's obliged to be a genius .PERIOD 
It's better ,COMMA but nobody .PERIOD 
This line of evolution is clearly positive .PERIOD 
But if you take a lens ,COMMA like that this line is ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack .PERIOD Like that .PERIOD 
There is different type of barbaria .PERIOD 
That's why ?QUESTIONMARK Today ,COMMA i'm so ashamed to make this job .PERIOD 
But i know that even i do it the best possible -- that's why i'm the best -- it's nothing .PERIOD 
And because we must all work to finish this story .PERIOD 
This scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent .PERIOD Like this idea we have invented this concept of god .PERIOD 
You go to the future back back back back like that .PERIOD 
He would also supply me with tools .PERIOD 
It was this great magic store .PERIOD It was a crappy little building in midtown .PERIOD But you'd be in the elevator .PERIOD The elevator would open -- there'd be this little small magic store .PERIOD You'd be in the magic store .PERIOD 
And so i started thinking about lost and the stuff that we do .PERIOD And i realized ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do .PERIOD 
Jack ,COMMA get him out of here .PERIOD Get him away from the engine .PERIOD Get him out of here .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA get away from -- jja :COLON now ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA if we wanted to do that ,COMMA we'd have to kill a stuntman .PERIOD 
And i often am like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA dude ,COMMA today i'm out .PERIOD I got nothing ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
So there's that in terms of the content of it ,COMMA you look at stories ,COMMA you think .PERIOD Well ,COMMA what are stories ,COMMA but mystery boxes .PERIOD 
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doing ,COMMA that intentionally is much more engaging .PERIOD 
Die :COLON hard right ?QUESTIONMARK Crazy :COLON great ,COMMA fun ,COMMA action-adventure movie in a building .PERIOD 
There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time ,COMMA but ,COMMA pretty great scenes .PERIOD 
Father ,COMMA 'cause i need it .PERIOD 
Come on .PERIOD So you think of jaws -- so that's the kind of stuff that ,COMMA like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
It's why when people do sequels ,COMMA or rip off movies ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of a genre ,COMMA they're ripping off the wrong thing .PERIOD 
You gotta rip off -- you know ,COMMA if you rip something off -- rip off the character .PERIOD 
Because ultimately ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the mystery box is all of us ,COMMA so there's that .PERIOD 
The moment the lights go down is often the best part .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited anticipation .PERIOD 
The stuff that i was lucky and begging for to get when i was a kid ,COMMA is now ubiquitous .PERIOD 
When i did mission impossible iii .PERIOD We had amazing visual effects stuff .PERIOD 
So eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet english guy ,COMMA he's like ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD I don't want to hurt you .PERIOD 
And i realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working .PERIOD Just as it was .PERIOD 
And tom would know just how hard to push the gun .PERIOD He wouldn't hurt himself .PERIOD 
And in the egyptian revolution ,COMMA the revolution <NUM> ,COMMA everyone has contributed something small or big ,COMMA they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind when it comes to revolutions .PERIOD 
It was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing .PERIOD 
But the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear .PERIOD 
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years .PERIOD And here comes the internet technology ,COMMA blackberry ,COMMA sms .PERIOD 
Platforms like youtube ,COMMA twitter facebook were helping us a lot ,COMMA because it basically gave us the impression that ,COMMA wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm not alone .PERIOD 
They probably have the best life in the world .PERIOD 
And everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother .PERIOD 
What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD 
In a few days ,COMMA tens of thousands of people there -- angry ,COMMA egyptians ,COMMA who were asking the ministry of interior affairs enough .PERIOD 
But of course ,COMMA they don't listen .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA one of the most ridiculous ideas was ,COMMA hey ,COMMA let's have a silent ,COMMA stand .PERIOD 
There was no leader .PERIOD 
And i'm not going to talk about my experience because this is not about me .PERIOD 
The next day i was in tahrir .PERIOD 
When i saw that ,COMMA i went back and i wrote on facebook .PERIOD 
But today i'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers .PERIOD 
And therein lies a critical puzzle .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's got to do with your brain .PERIOD 
But we as adults are no longer absorbing ,COMMA those statistics .PERIOD 
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .PERIOD 
So this is little emma .PERIOD 
Just as the poets and writers described ,COMMA we're going to be able to see ,COMMA i think ,COMMA that wondrous openness ,COMMA utter and complete openness ,COMMA of the mind of a child .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And early in the morning i went into the ward .PERIOD 
I watched her hands .PERIOD As she bathed an old man .PERIOD 
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever .PERIOD 
And he walked in ,COMMA and somebody said something to him ,COMMA we realized he was deaf ,COMMA and we looked into the rags ,COMMA and there was this pair of eyes .PERIOD 
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned .PERIOD 
It was the young women ,COMMA the health aids ,COMMA who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds .PERIOD 
And my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me .PERIOD 
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .PERIOD 
I had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood illness .PERIOD 
And in that paralysis ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .PERIOD 
The very word ,COMMA terror is global .PERIOD 
So our work ,COMMA in a certain way ,COMMA is to address this imago .PERIOD This kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe .PERIOD 
Hey .PERIOD We live in a very noxious world .PERIOD 
Why don't we train our children in compassion ?QUESTIONMARK 
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered .PERIOD Unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is .PERIOD 
And they have actualized compassion through direct action .PERIOD 
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .PERIOD 
I was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour .PERIOD 
Then there was aron kader .PERIOD Who was the palestinian-american .PERIOD 
And i opened it up .PERIOD It said ,COMMA born in iran .PERIOD I'm like ,COMMA oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK Come on .PERIOD Man .PERIOD 
Ah :COLON ha .PERIOD American .PERIOD Great .PERIOD 
His name was jabbar .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA you wait ,COMMA i'll be back ,COMMA and he walked away .PERIOD 
Like a couple months ago ,COMMA in times square in new york .PERIOD There was this pakistani muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb .PERIOD 
And one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .PERIOD 
We just wanted to say we tried .PERIOD 
Out of my way out of my way out of my way .PERIOD 
You want some frozen yogurt .PERIOD 
I have one gram ,COMMA five gram ,COMMA <NUM> gram .PERIOD How many gram do you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
I put my two year-old on the slide .PERIOD He went ,COMMA frrmrmm !EXCLAMATIONMARK He took off .PERIOD 
I went down ,COMMA i go .PERIOD Where's my son ?QUESTIONMARK 
I go ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD Then .PERIOD Why were you staring at me ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i would like to show you something i've been working on .PERIOD 
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .PERIOD 
But it was his production of a butterfly .PERIOD That was the most beautiful .PERIOD 
Marco !EXCLAMATIONMARK Tempest !EXCLAMATIONMARK When asked about deception .PERIOD He said this .PERIOD Announcer !EXCLAMATIONMARK Magic is the only honest profession .PERIOD 
I use a lot of tricks ,COMMA which means that sometimes i have to lie to you .PERIOD 
Girl in phone :COLON hey .PERIOD Where are you .PERIOD 
Lady .PERIOD I'll be ready in just a minute ,COMMA darling .PERIOD 
Self-deception .PERIOD 
Which is why ?QUESTIONMARK In this vast and lonely cosmos .PERIOD We are so wonderfully optimistic .PERIOD 
Put a crab inside it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the guy replies ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i know .PERIOD I know .PERIOD 
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing ,COMMA awkward silences ,COMMA and very simple rhyme schemes .PERIOD 
[ i don't need <NUM> write it down .PERIOD ] i'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA as many of you may remember the red brigades was a terrorist marxist organization ,COMMA which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s .PERIOD 
As part of their strategy ,COMMA the red brigades ,COMMA never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA they declared the end of the armed struggle .PERIOD 
But this is exactly what i did ,COMMA because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist ,COMMA and why she'd never tried to recruit me .PERIOD 
So because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms ,COMMA all of the sudden i thought maybe there is something here .PERIOD 
And there are three main stages .PERIOD 
But above all ,COMMA they started to do serious business with the world of crime .PERIOD 
Rogue .PERIOD Economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .PERIOD 
And it actually happened again with the fall of the berlin wall .PERIOD 
What does it mean .PERIOD That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have .PERIOD 
This privilege is called seigniorage .PERIOD 
No other country can do that .PERIOD 
What the patriot act did was to prohibit us ,COMMA bank and us-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .PERIOD 
It also gave the us .PERIOD Monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
It was introduced only in the united states .PERIOD 
In europe ,COMMA a similar legislation was not introduced .PERIOD 
Cumulatively ,COMMA i will have rowed over <NUM> miles ,COMMA taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than <NUM> days alone on the ocean on a <NUM> .PERIOD Foot rowboat .PERIOD 
Now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute .PERIOD She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower .PERIOD 
I thought there were them ,COMMA and there were us ,COMMA and i was not one of them .PERIOD 
And i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me .PERIOD 
I'd gone through some changes .PERIOD 
And i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking ,COMMA oh boy ,COMMA i'm on totally the wrong track .PERIOD Here .PERIOD 
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one .PERIOD 
Mostly :COLON a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown ,COMMA depending on whether i went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion .PERIOD 
So because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in .PERIOD I decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .PERIOD 
But what do you do .PERIOD 
I had a meeting with the president there ,COMMA who told me about his exit strategy for his country .PERIOD 
I even met one of them ,COMMA and she was just about my size .PERIOD 
This is a world-wide community .PERIOD 
I plan on being around for a long time .PERIOD And when i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA i want to be happy and healthy .PERIOD 
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air .PERIOD 
And the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day .PERIOD 
And if you put creation and optimism together ,COMMA you've got two choices that you can talk about .PERIOD 
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .PERIOD 
This was a scheme by a team called think a new york-based team .PERIOD And then there was that one ,COMMA which was the libeskind scheme .PERIOD 
We all want to go out and buy an audi .PERIOD Tt .PERIOD Don't we .PERIOD 
It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger ,COMMA sort of more romantic image of where we are .PERIOD 
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page .PERIOD And you can see the world outside you ,COMMA as you walk around .PERIOD It .PERIOD 
They all want to save money by building the same thing .PERIOD <NUM> times .PERIOD 
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana .PERIOD 
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune .PERIOD 
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before .PERIOD 
It has its own built-in swimming pool .PERIOD Very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA it is going across ,COMMA and there down the other side ,COMMA and you get the same kind of grandeur .PERIOD 
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white .PERIOD 
Rosa mexicano restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of acapulco ,COMMA up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go like that .PERIOD 
Boo hewerdine :COLON thomas dolby :COLON thank you very much for inviting me .PERIOD It's been a blessing singing for you .PERIOD 
Right ?QUESTIONMARK Now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .PERIOD 
This next artist .PERIOD Ns .PERIOD Harsha actually has a studio right here in mysore .PERIOD 
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD 
He creates these fine ,COMMA delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD 
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian art .PERIOD Subodh gupta .PERIOD 
But i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today .PERIOD 
So i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD First of all ,COMMA i want to show you the particular illusion here .PERIOD I want you ,COMMA first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD These are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD These are real objects that i'm going to show you .PERIOD Now i'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD I've looped the film here ,COMMA so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD I want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD Now ,COMMA watch as it rotates back .PERIOD How quickly your perception snaps ?QUESTIONMARK Ok ,COMMA now .PERIOD 
How many of you here ?QUESTIONMARK See ,COMMA dolphins ?QUESTIONMARK Raise your hand if you see dolphins ?QUESTIONMARK Ok ?QUESTIONMARK Those people who raised their hands afterwards .PERIOD The rest of the audience .PERIOD Go talk to them .PERIOD All right ,COMMA actually .PERIOD This is the best example of priming by experience that i know .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too .PERIOD This was done by saatchi and saatchi .PERIOD And they actually got away with this ad in australia .PERIOD So if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions ,COMMA but they got it passed and actually won the clio awards .PERIOD So it's funny how you can do these things .PERIOD 
You can violate your expectations about experience here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine .PERIOD But you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate .PERIOD This is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks ,COMMA and that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there's analog .PERIOD And digital thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running [behind] .PERIOD I want to show you quickly what i've created ,COMMA some new type of illusions .PERIOD I've done something with taking the pixar-type illusions .PERIOD So you see these kids the same size here ,COMMA running down the hall ,COMMA the two table tops of the same size .PERIOD 
And it's interesting by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion .PERIOD How much stronger the illusions are any case .PERIOD I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness .PERIOD And if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside .PERIOD I'd be happy to show you lots of things .PERIOD 
So i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD 
I'm here today ,COMMA as june said to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years .PERIOD 
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .PERIOD 
So we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures .PERIOD 
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals ,COMMA and kelps ,COMMA and sponges and nudibranchs ,COMMA is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .PERIOD 
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD It happens to be a fact .PERIOD 
Before hyperbolic geometry ,COMMA mathematicians knew about two kinds of space ,COMMA euclidean space ,COMMA and spherical space .PERIOD 
And they have different properties .PERIOD 
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the earth .PERIOD 
And on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle .PERIOD You can draw .PERIOD 
To a mathematician ,COMMA if there are two answers ,COMMA and the first two are zero .PERIOD And one ,COMMA there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .PERIOD 
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you ,COMMA they're sitting there feeling bamboozled .PERIOD 
I've stitched euclid's ,COMMA parallel postulate on to the surface .PERIOD 
Here's two creatures who've never heard of euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD 
I once asked ,COMMA the mathematicians ,COMMA why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible .PERIOD When sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age .PERIOD 
And that's true ,COMMA but it also goes deeper than that .PERIOD 
And so too ,COMMA we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD 
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three ,COMMA increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code ,COMMA the models immediately started to look more natural .PERIOD 
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education established by a man named friedrich froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer in the 19th century .PERIOD 
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas ,COMMA through physical forms of play .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so how do you study this mysterious organ .PERIOD 
So let me give you a few striking examples of this .PERIOD 
And if you look ,COMMA tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
But there's another rare syndrome ,COMMA so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks ,COMMA is a freudian view ,COMMA and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women by the way .PERIOD But i'll just talk about guys .PERIOD 
Thank god ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother .PERIOD 
It's very ingenious ,COMMA as all freudian arguments are -- -- but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion ,COMMA about his pet poodle .PERIOD 
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD 
Now when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .PERIOD 
There's no delusion through the phone .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day :COLON do they get phantom pms .PERIOD 
Now why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis ,COMMA so you can relieve him of this excruciating ,COMMA clenching spasm of the phantom arm .PERIOD 
He had a brachial avulsion ,COMMA so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed ,COMMA lying in a sling for a year .PERIOD And then the arm was amputated .PERIOD 
My first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA look at your reflection of your phantom .PERIOD 
He knows it's a mirror reflection .PERIOD But it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD 
And he says ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD I don't believe this .PERIOD 
And then i said ,COMMA close your eyes .PERIOD 
So i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek -- well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA what's gone .PERIOD 
These people muddle up their senses .PERIOD 
Why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA remember -- why does this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
And that is ,COMMA there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA every brain region is wired to every other region .PERIOD And these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD 
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction ,COMMA meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki ,COMMA in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells being excited -- kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection ,COMMA sudden inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion ,COMMA but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern .PERIOD But the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD 
Sorry about that .PERIOD 
My talk will be in two parts .PERIOD I'll talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race .PERIOD 
So that's another project for nasa .PERIOD 
It landed on the surface .PERIOD This is pictures taken on the way down .PERIOD 
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life .PERIOD 
And until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom ,COMMA quantum effects could shake everything .PERIOD 
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small ,COMMA but we want to understand the very complex .PERIOD 
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of .PERIOD 
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD 
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is ,COMMA <NUM> kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .PERIOD 
If i was not a self-effacing brit ,COMMA i would mention the book myself ,COMMA and i would add that it's available in paperback .PERIOD 
First any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD 
He persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell .PERIOD 
We need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists ,COMMA computer ,COMMA experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD 
I wrote my book ,COMMA our final century ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD But there's one respect ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in which ,COMMA being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future .PERIOD 
The stupendous time :COLON spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the american bible belt ,COMMA anyway -- but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead .PERIOD 
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond .PERIOD 
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for <NUM> years ,COMMA but for the entire <NUM> billion-year history of our earth .PERIOD 
Then other things happened even more abruptly .PERIOD 
Right now he's in a forest in georgia .PERIOD 
The bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us ,COMMA and their arms still longer is more upright .PERIOD Just as we are .PERIOD 
Slim-bodied bonobos are by nature ,COMMA very gentle creatures .PERIOD 
This is kanzi .PERIOD And i in the forest .PERIOD 
We need more sticks too .PERIOD 
Good job .PERIOD 
Video ;SEMICOLON kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands ,COMMA to strike one against the other .PERIOD 
Kanzi's ;SEMICOLON rock is from gona ethiopia ,COMMA and is identical to that used by our african ancestors .PERIOD Two-and-a-half million years ago .PERIOD 
She's also saying the name of that with her voice .PERIOD 
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD 
Ss :COLON very .PERIOD Nice .PERIOD Beautiful ,COMMA panbanisha .PERIOD 
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram .PERIOD 
The next symbol ,COMMA panbanisha writes represents collar .PERIOD 
Researchers began to record what panbanisha said .PERIOD By writing lexigrams on the floor ,COMMA with chalk .PERIOD 
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD 
Narrator .PERIOD Kanzi plays the xylophone using both hands .PERIOD He enthusiastically accompanies dr .PERIOD Sue's singing .PERIOD 
Kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities .PERIOD 
So we have a bi-species environment ,COMMA we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD 
Here's a site ,COMMA which allows you to look at recovery spending in california .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov .PERIOD And datagovuk .PERIOD 
And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level .PERIOD 
The light blue is refugee camps .PERIOD These volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] .PERIOD 
So if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA i just wanted to say ,COMMA whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting ,COMMA raw data now .PERIOD 
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD 
Within a year congress funded huge weapons increases .PERIOD And we went from <NUM> nuclear weapons to <NUM> .PERIOD 
Support for engineering ,COMMA math and science -- education in general -- boomed .PERIOD 
And so if you'll put up with this ,COMMA i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today .PERIOD The experiment is -- and i notice ,COMMA by the way that when you applauded ,COMMA that you did it in a typical north american way ,COMMA that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent .PERIOD 
So what do we make of that ?QUESTIONMARK First of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant .PERIOD 
Do you need to be alive ?QUESTIONMARK I mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you see that in nature .PERIOD 
Keep in mind that although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate ,COMMA what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior .PERIOD 
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD 
As i say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group .PERIOD 
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about .PERIOD This .PERIOD 
Specifically ,COMMA it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together ,COMMA in perfect synchrony .PERIOD To reinforce a message to the females .PERIOD 
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it .PERIOD Or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD 
But i hope you've convinced yourself now ,COMMA with this nighttime video ,COMMA that they really were very well synchronized .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is ,COMMA do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order ?QUESTIONMARK And i've already hinted that the answer is no .PERIOD 
Now you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD 
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light .PERIOD And then scamper across on this blade of light .PERIOD 
Think of the bridge as being like this platform .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison ,COMMA not only with each other ,COMMA but with the bridge .PERIOD 
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge .PERIOD 
But how could the crowd become synchronized .PERIOD 
Allan !EXCLAMATIONMARK Mcrobie is a bridge ,COMMA engineer ,COMMA from cambridge ,COMMA who wrote to me ,COMMA suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length .PERIOD 
Their instructions just walk normally .PERIOD 
That indeed ,COMMA a mass extinction was underway in our fields .PERIOD In our agricultural system .PERIOD 
So if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and i had a slide like this ,COMMA and i switched it every second .PERIOD It would take up my entire ted talk .PERIOD And i wouldn't have to say anything .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA these apples come from your ancestors ,COMMA and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor .PERIOD They could give them .PERIOD 
The bad news is they're extinct .PERIOD 
The coldest growing seasons of the future ,COMMA hotter than the hottest of the past .PERIOD 
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings ,COMMA financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures ,COMMA and all kinds of things .PERIOD And every time something like this happens ,COMMA it means extinction .PERIOD We lose diversity .PERIOD 
Because quite literally ,COMMA if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change ,COMMA neither will we .PERIOD 
Important health message :COLON blogging may be hazardous to your health ,COMMA especially if you are a male .PERIOD 
This is male blogging posture ,COMMA sitting .PERIOD And the result is ,COMMA for greater comfort .PERIOD Men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women when working on laptop .PERIOD 
This is a very serious research ,COMMA that you should read the underline .PERIOD 
Wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor .PERIOD And there are some enhanced protection measures ,COMMA which i would like to share with you .PERIOD And i would like ,COMMA in a minute ,COMMA to thank philips for helping .PERIOD 
I'm really troubled by that .PERIOD But anyway ,COMMA that's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people ,COMMA who will be our great leaders later .PERIOD 
Aviation week ,COMMA asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first <NUM> years of aviation .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what happened when i was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
And this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is .PERIOD Now we thought there'd be animals there .PERIOD We knew there were plants there .PERIOD The colors change right .PERIOD 
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 .PERIOD That was done in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Here's the biggie ,COMMA and that is ,COMMA you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it .PERIOD 
Computers were used for artillery first ,COMMA then irs .PERIOD 
Keep that in mind ,COMMA i put down innovation -- i've looked for innovation cycles in space ,COMMA i found none .PERIOD 
And i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .PERIOD 
But i think once it does ,COMMA we will find solutions .PERIOD And very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort hotels in orbit .PERIOD 
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children ,COMMA this little three- to 15-year-old age ,COMMA by us going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time period .PERIOD 
Paul allen ,COMMA elan musk :COLON richard branson ,COMMA jeff bezos ,COMMA the ansari family .PERIOD Which is now funding the russians' sub-orbital thing .PERIOD Bob bigelow ,COMMA a private space station and carmack .PERIOD 
There were a couple of examples here .PERIOD 
And i'm talking about if you've got a baby now ,COMMA or if you've got a 10-year-old now .PERIOD 
Relatively soon you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD It's never happened before .PERIOD 
You can fly with russian hardware .PERIOD This is available because a russian space program is starving .PERIOD And it's nice for them to get <NUM> million here and there to take one of the seats .PERIOD 
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD And what that means is before we know it .PERIOD The progress in human space flight ,COMMA with no taxpayer dollars ,COMMA will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .PERIOD 
And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to focus on cancer ,COMMA because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer .PERIOD Every type of cancer .PERIOD 
This is a tumor :COLON dark ,COMMA gray ,COMMA ominous mass growing inside a brain .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD Judah folkman ,COMMA who was my mentor ?QUESTIONMARK And who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field ,COMMA once called this cancer without disease .PERIOD 
And unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis is already turned on .PERIOD And cancer cells are growing like wild .PERIOD 
We call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy ,COMMA because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i've just shown you two very different types of cancer .PERIOD That both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .PERIOD 
And we subsequently treated more than <NUM> dogs .PERIOD 
It had already spread to his lymph nodes .PERIOD So we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail .PERIOD So we could treat from the inside ,COMMA as well as the outside .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people ,COMMA as well as dogs are already becoming available .PERIOD 
But the real question is :COLON how well do these work in practice .PERIOD 
So here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .PERIOD 
But for other tumors and cancer types ,COMMA the improvements have only been modest .PERIOD 
And as a doctor ,COMMA i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage ,COMMA achieving a cure can be difficult ,COMMA if not impossible .PERIOD 
But i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking what could we be adding to our diet that's naturally antiangiogenic .PERIOD That could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers .PERIOD 
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .PERIOD 
This means there's food synergy .PERIOD 
Here's some more data from our testing .PERIOD 
Now in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .PERIOD 
Soy :COLON parsley !EXCLAMATIONMARK Garlic !EXCLAMATIONMARK Grapes !EXCLAMATIONMARK Berries !EXCLAMATIONMARK I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD 
And like a tumor fat grows .PERIOD When blood vessels grow .PERIOD 
Albert szent-gyorgi ,COMMA once said ,COMMA that discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking ,COMMA what no one has thought .PERIOD 
Right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer .PERIOD Would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence .PERIOD 
I've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things .PERIOD 
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression .PERIOD 
It's all figure .PERIOD 
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD 
Now if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA let's make it a little harder ,COMMA still ,COMMA pretty easy .PERIOD 
I wanted to make a sequel .PERIOD 
Garry :COLON trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how on earth ?QUESTIONMARK Can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna .PERIOD 
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .PERIOD 
But it takes some persistence .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time ,COMMA computer games meant things like doom ,COMMA where you're going around shooting things .PERIOD Very violent games :COLON very fast aimed at teenage boys ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK That's who plays computer games .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA guess what that's changing .PERIOD 
And it's a game you play with other people .PERIOD 
A lot of people do sudoku ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD 
Anybody .PERIOD 
What i want to talk about today is this particular cell ,COMMA or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us .PERIOD 
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD 
And i want you imagine that at some point in history ,COMMA a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing ,COMMA eradicating ,COMMA destroying ,COMMA reducing these cells ,COMMA basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was by the way ,COMMA patriarchy .PERIOD 
To be a leader means not to be a girl .PERIOD 
And i'd also like to say that the irony ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denying girl ,COMMA suppressing girl ,COMMA suppressing emotion ,COMMA refusing feeling has lead thus here .PERIOD 
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence ,COMMA the most horrific poverty ,COMMA genocide ,COMMA mass rapes ,COMMA the destruction of the earth ,COMMA is completely out of control .PERIOD 
In the congo ,COMMA for those of you who don't know there has been a war raging for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD A war that has killed nearly six million people .PERIOD 
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled ,COMMA and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically ,COMMA all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals .PERIOD So the west can have it and profit from them .PERIOD 
That shattering ,COMMA that opening of my girl cell ,COMMA that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous ,COMMA and braver ,COMMA and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life .PERIOD 
I want to change the verb .PERIOD 
I want the verb to be educate or activate or engage or confront ,COMMA or defy ,COMMA or create .PERIOD 
I know a 14-year-old girl .PERIOD In the netherlands ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .PERIOD 
And i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu ,COMMA who was impregnated by her rapist .PERIOD 
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like ,COMMA and what a mutilated vagina looked like .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA well now i need a house .PERIOD 
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing .PERIOD 
She imagined her father killing her on one hand .PERIOD And ,COMMA mama ,COMMA agnes greeting her ,COMMA with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .PERIOD 
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .PERIOD 
In that hut ,COMMA we walked in .PERIOD And her father and his four wives were sitting there ,COMMA and her sisters who had just returned ,COMMA because they had all fled when she had fled .PERIOD And her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .PERIOD 
And that is the power of transformation .PERIOD 
But i really want to do it for each and every person here to value the girl in us ,COMMA to value the part that cries ,COMMA to value the part that's emotional to value the part that's vulnerable to understand .PERIOD That's where the future lies .PERIOD 
I rejoice that it's still in my body .PERIOD 
I am an emotional creature .PERIOD 
I can take you back .PERIOD 
Nothing's been diluted .PERIOD 
I love hear me .PERIOD I love that i can feel the feelings inside you ,COMMA even if they stop my life ,COMMA even if they break my heart ,COMMA even if they take me off track ,COMMA they make me responsible .PERIOD 
Your body is covered with fractals .PERIOD 
Let's see first iteration ,COMMA second ,COMMA third ,COMMA fourth .PERIOD 
So native americans ,COMMA use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .PERIOD 
It is not the same pattern at two different scales .PERIOD 
In some cases ,COMMA there would actually be algorithms ,COMMA and very sophisticated algorithms .PERIOD 
So i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things ,COMMA this guy in mali ,COMMA just outside of bamako .PERIOD And i asked him ,COMMA how come you're making fractal fences because nobody else is .PERIOD 
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology .PERIOD 
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry .PERIOD It was in a symbolic code .PERIOD And this was bamana sand .PERIOD Divination .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA out of desperation ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let me explain georg cantor in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And then you take this symbol and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols .PERIOD 
And i know brian eno says there's not enough africa in computers ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't think there's enough african history in brian eno .PERIOD 
We got a small seed grant ,COMMA just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this .PERIOD We're very excited about the future possibilities for that .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .PERIOD

♫ founding fathers all had slaves .PERIOD ♫ sweeney :COLON i know .PERIOD 
♫ lewis :COLON carroll :COLON i'm sure did alice ♫ sweeney :COLON what .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA i like ,COMMA oprah -- i like her girlfriendy-ness ,COMMA i like her weight issues ,COMMA i like how she's transformed talk television .PERIOD I like how she's brought reading back to america -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks .PERIOD That was i call it the soon-yi moment .PERIOD It is the moment when i cannot continue supporting someone .PERIOD 
It makes what the bleep .PERIOD Do .PERIOD We know seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is .PERIOD 
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you ,COMMA in this presentation .PERIOD 
The challenge ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to answer this question .PERIOD What permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere .PERIOD 
And if we could figure that out ,COMMA how can we implement those designs .PERIOD 
Think about it ,COMMA if you were an engineer and i told you that you had to build an automobile .PERIOD But it had to start off to be this big ,COMMA then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way .PERIOD 
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile ,COMMA i'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .PERIOD 
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick .PERIOD How is that true ?QUESTIONMARK 
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well .PERIOD We took their three legs .PERIOD We collapsed them down as one .PERIOD 
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all .PERIOD 
It has six legs -- there are the tuned ,COMMA springy ,COMMA legs .PERIOD 
Robert full ;SEMICOLON it'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet ,COMMA but i'll talk about that later .PERIOD 
Like if we had a piece of tape ,COMMA now we'd peel it this way .PERIOD 
They do this with their toes ,COMMA it's bizarre ,COMMA this peeling inspired irobot -- that we work with -- to build mecho-geckos .PERIOD 
And here's the peeling action of the mecho-gecko .PERIOD 
Here's an individual hair with a little split end there .PERIOD 
No force is too low .PERIOD Do they do it by electrostatics .PERIOD 
And just recently ,COMMA we've made a breakthrough ,COMMA where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic ,COMMA self-cleaning ,COMMA dry adhesive .PERIOD Many companies are interested in this .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .PERIOD 
Most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel dung or wood .PERIOD 
And the problem is this :COLON women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
We also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year .PERIOD 
In the high-income part of our workforce ,COMMA in the people who end up at the top -- fortune <NUM> ceo ,COMMA jobs or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem i am convinced ,COMMA is that women are dropping out .PERIOD 
This is hard .PERIOD I feel guilty ,COMMA sometimes .PERIOD 
My brother is kind of busy .PERIOD 
Because what the data shows above all else is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women .PERIOD 
This is the complication .PERIOD 
And that's a problem because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home .PERIOD For people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .PERIOD 
Message .PERIOD Number :COLON three :COLON don't leave before you leave .PERIOD 
And literally ,COMMA from that moment she doesn't raise her hand anymore ,COMMA she doesn't look for a promotion .PERIOD She doesn't take on the new project .PERIOD She doesn't say me .PERIOD I want to do that .PERIOD 
My generation really ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA is not going to change the numbers at the top .PERIOD 
If you want to get at the big part -- i mean from a public health level ,COMMA where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues .PERIOD 
We talk about it in terms of engagement ,COMMA or non-compliance .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them ,COMMA but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD 
So they asked them at the beginning .PERIOD Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA fear showed up as not really the driver .PERIOD 
It was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work ,COMMA who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD 
It's an amazing notion .PERIOD 
And i had to explain they're trying to scare people .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA i know where i sit ,COMMA i know where i'm situated .PERIOD 
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action .PERIOD 
The choice ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA is pretty simple .PERIOD 
We either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down .PERIOD 
They reduce speeds by about five to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
They last for about five miles in which case ,COMMA we put our foot back on the pedal .PERIOD 
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it .PERIOD 
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal works for our food ,COMMA actually helps people understand what's in their food .PERIOD 
They're just not for us .PERIOD They're not for people ,COMMA they're not for patients .PERIOD 
This is the worst presented information .PERIOD 
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .PERIOD 
The last one i'll show you is a psa test .PERIOD 
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA on the other hand by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard ,COMMA it changes the string length ,COMMA that changes the frequency of the sound wave .PERIOD 
And now i realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings ,COMMA we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD 
But although some of them were quite up there for me .PERIOD 
And i realized we actually had quite a bit in common :COLON both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another .PERIOD And both of us -- probably ,COMMA if i can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots .PERIOD 
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature .PERIOD The bee as well as me .PERIOD 
And that's when i got the idea which was well what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species ,COMMA who are working on us .PERIOD 
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me .PERIOD Not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology ,COMMA but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses .PERIOD Had exploited us ,COMMA figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .PERIOD 
And suddenly everything looked different .PERIOD 
I'm a dupe .PERIOD I'm a dupe of the lawns ,COMMA whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees ,COMMA who they compete with for sunlight .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me go through what you gain when you look at the world .PERIOD This way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire .PERIOD 
As an intellectual matter ,COMMA looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this darwinian revolution <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
This is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia .PERIOD 
The idea is he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement .PERIOD 
And i'll show you if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
So one day ,COMMA cattle in a pen .PERIOD 
The eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses ,COMMA <NUM> chickens .PERIOD 
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs ,COMMA and in the process they're spreading the manure out .PERIOD 
And within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again .PERIOD 
Put that in play .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots .PERIOD They kind of cauterize them ,COMMA and the roots die .PERIOD 
And they're labeled by color right now ,COMMA by language .PERIOD 
But you can also see ,COMMA there are places where there's not so much .PERIOD 
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the us .PERIOD 
And so i guess the us .PERIOD Finally ,COMMA finally ,COMMA started to like it too .PERIOD 
And it's something i'm very excited to be a part of .PERIOD 
But it was a dream of his ,COMMA and we ,COMMA basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them .PERIOD 
You can see ,COMMA even though the us is still the majority here -- though ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA search-wise ,COMMA it's only about <NUM> percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to japan and the uk .PERIOD And europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries .PERIOD 
And -- well ,COMMA i'll leave you in suspense .PERIOD 
So one of the things -- both sergey ,COMMA and i went to a montessori school .PERIOD And i think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in google .PERIOD 
And sergey mentioned orkut ,COMMA which is something that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orkut wanted to do in his time .PERIOD And we call this -- at google .PERIOD We've embodied this as the <NUM> percent time ,COMMA and the idea is for <NUM> percent of your time .PERIOD If you're working at google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do .PERIOD 
And this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the <NUM> things in your head ,COMMA which you did by writing them down ,COMMA that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar .PERIOD 
And the nice thing about this ,COMMA we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up .PERIOD And this ,COMMA let's them really make money .PERIOD And i -- you know ,COMMA there's a number of people i met -- i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i wasn't making any money .PERIOD 
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sleeping a lot .PERIOD 
And i think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model ,COMMA because everyone in the world has access to our search .PERIOD And i think that's a tremendous tremendous benefit .PERIOD 
So i'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD 
It's not very good .PERIOD It's cluttered .PERIOD 
If you're not too bad ,COMMA there's nothing you can do .PERIOD 
It's actually about using dynamics ,COMMA using forces ,COMMA to influence the behavior of where you are ,COMMA what you do there ,COMMA how you do it .PERIOD 
Come here at a certain time ,COMMA get your drinks half off .PERIOD 
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior .PERIOD It's influenced our entire culture .PERIOD 
They will return like clockwork at different times .PERIOD 
Modern warfare ,COMMA one of the most successful selling games of all time .PERIOD 
It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings .PERIOD 
School -- and remember ,COMMA i made it through one year .PERIOD So i think i'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game .PERIOD It's just not a terribly well-designed game right .PERIOD 
There are statuses .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status .PERIOD 
That sucks .PERIOD Why not level-up .PERIOD 
And it's very powerful .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA you see this is a paladin level <NUM> .PERIOD And that's a paladin level <NUM> .PERIOD And if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul .PERIOD You'd probably want to be the bigger one right .PERIOD 
Their most dedicated players ,COMMA it's like a full-time job .PERIOD 
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it where ,COMMA by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen ,COMMA and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD 
So we have to use this one carefully .PERIOD 
It's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one .PERIOD And my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use .PERIOD 
Now this gentleman ,COMMA isambard ,COMMA kingdom ,COMMA brunel designed ,COMMA many great things in his career in the 19th century ,COMMA including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe .PERIOD 
His greatest creation runs actually ,COMMA right through here in oxford .PERIOD 
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york .PERIOD 
And i'd like to talk about some of those ,COMMA just for the next few minutes .PERIOD 
So it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service .PERIOD 
And the faster we do that ,COMMA the faster our ideas evolve .PERIOD 
This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .PERIOD 
They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients ,COMMA using a simple software tool .PERIOD 
And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone .PERIOD 
But again ,COMMA we are in the midst of massive change .PERIOD 
How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people ,COMMA and at the same time ,COMMA stimulate innovation amongst local water providers .PERIOD 
What kinds of questions do we think design thinking ?QUESTIONMARK Could be used to tackle .PERIOD 
There is a hash tag there that you can use .PERIOD #cbdq .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA since i couldn't have my tea the way i wanted it ,COMMA i ordered a cup of coffee ,COMMA which the waiter brought over promptly .PERIOD 
But from the japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .PERIOD 
As i do so ,COMMA i hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD 
It is essential for success .PERIOD 
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,COMMA and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers .PERIOD With .PERIOD 
In reality ,COMMA the kids who were told what to do ,COMMA whether by miss smith or their mothers ,COMMA were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed .PERIOD When they were told that their mothers had been consulted .PERIOD 
The first-generation .PERIOD Children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .PERIOD 
Americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference .PERIOD 
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people <NUM> or more options when they're making a choice ,COMMA they make poorer decisions ,COMMA whether it be health care ,COMMA investment ,COMMA other critical areas .PERIOD 
They'd already picked out a name for her barbara after her grandmother .PERIOD 
Unable to breathe on her own .PERIOD She was put on a ventilator .PERIOD 
This narrative promises so much ,COMMA freedom .PERIOD Happiness ,COMMA success .PERIOD 
Instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written .PERIOD 
No matter where we're from and what your narrative is :COLON we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do .PERIOD And what it can represent .PERIOD 
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice ,COMMA to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises ,COMMA but doesn't always deliver .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and i stripped the labels off .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA good morning .PERIOD 
And it's not just what these are doing to each other ,COMMA but it's what the audience thinks that really frames .PERIOD This matter .PERIOD 
To get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme we've talked about all week .PERIOD I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners .PERIOD 
Girl <NUM> :COLON because they're going to lose all their money eventually .PERIOD 
Doesn't work out too well for them .PERIOD They lose money .PERIOD 
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at .PERIOD 
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory ,COMMA the velocity ,COMMA you will notice has dropped off to a minimum .PERIOD 
But like ,COMMA let's imagine .PERIOD We took the latest pentium processor ,COMMA the latest core <NUM> extreme ,COMMA which is a four-core processor that intel's working on .PERIOD It will be our laptop tomorrow .PERIOD 
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs .PERIOD 
Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern ,COMMA new selling arrangements and new types of programs .PERIOD That may arrest the declining revenues .PERIOD 
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio .PERIOD But i don't know how .PERIOD 
It was the dawn of interactive tv .PERIOD And you may have noticed ,COMMA they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits .PERIOD 
Pete :COLON i could use any ordinary open-source crayon ,COMMA why do i have to buy theirs ?QUESTIONMARK 
But we will discuss this scandal .PERIOD Because this man ,COMMA jack berry ,COMMA the host of winky dink went on to become the host of .PERIOD Twenty one one of the most important quiz shows ever .PERIOD 
We'll talk a little bit more about him later .PERIOD 
It's the era of big business ,COMMA and data centers for computing .PERIOD 
It all happened within five miles of where i'm standing at stanford university between <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
Hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks ,COMMA where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system .PERIOD And we had no way of explaining it .PERIOD 
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians .PERIOD 
And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry ,COMMA and the re-regulation of the cable television industry .PERIOD 
Voice <NUM> ,COMMA next on the gourmet pet channel ,COMMA decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer .PERIOD 
We come into the era of the dotcom ,COMMA the world wide web .PERIOD And i don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together .PERIOD 
Voice <NUM> :COLON you'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word .PERIOD The terrorist threat is over .PERIOD 
And media companies realize the audience is important .PERIOD Also .PERIOD 
And i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business .PERIOD 
They think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv .PERIOD And as books used to be the content ,COMMA novels used to be the content of movies .PERIOD 
And i used three criteria .PERIOD The first was ,COMMA i thought i'd talk about real design within reach design that's free .PERIOD Not design ,COMMA not quite within reach ,COMMA as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors ,COMMA but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages .PERIOD 
Wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york .PERIOD 
How did i get started in this business ?QUESTIONMARK 
In italy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA almost everything kind of looks good .PERIOD 
I've come across some other just kind of ,COMMA curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations .PERIOD But -- these things amuse me .PERIOD 
And i came down one day ,COMMA and all the bikes were red .PERIOD 
And at that moment the sun came out .PERIOD And through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear ,COMMA and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ,COMMA ok ,COMMA about stuff .PERIOD 
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity ,COMMA and to mix with other people .PERIOD 
And it's a welcoming area .PERIOD I think ,COMMA inclusive of diversity ,COMMA reflective of diversity .PERIOD And i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the us .PERIOD 
And i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes .PERIOD 
You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air .PERIOD 
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics ,COMMA and all this sort of thing .PERIOD 
So i chose furniture .PERIOD 
And i chose chairs specifically ,COMMA because i knew something about them .PERIOD 
There are drawbacks to this .PERIOD 
One is you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD 
So he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i'll come over and look at it .PERIOD 
So here we are .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if you watch this chair as i recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD 
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD 
What does that mean my environment .PERIOD 
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .PERIOD 
You spend it at rest ,COMMA and you spend it at work .PERIOD 
So then i decided to leave that part of the world .PERIOD And i was going to go to the mid-west .PERIOD 
Very nice .PERIOD And there my older senior lungs ,COMMA as i like to call them ,COMMA i filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA almost like the highest in the nation .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what's wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach .PERIOD 
Now i've circled the places where i've been .PERIOD 
Oh .PERIOD Not so lucky .PERIOD 
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck .PERIOD 
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa .PERIOD 
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room ,COMMA instead of just the pink slip ,COMMA that said ,COMMA i paid at the counter right .PERIOD 
And i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
So .PERIOD 
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad .PERIOD 
I'd be like some kind of internet genius and me ,COMMA i'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop -- i'd go wireless .PERIOD 
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise as wild and as organized as i think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get ,COMMA but ,COMMA ooh-eee ,COMMA you want to bet just how whack and un-pc your mac or pc ?QUESTIONMARK Is going to be when i'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA don't say a prayer .PERIOD 
Thank you ,COMMA ted .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for roughly <NUM> years ,COMMA the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture .PERIOD Because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body .PERIOD 
So whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry .PERIOD Whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry .PERIOD 
Now the only way we could design that ,COMMA or possibly construct it ,COMMA is by using a calculus-based definition of the form .PERIOD 
It also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it .PERIOD Because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it .PERIOD 
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD 
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects .PERIOD But what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by <NUM> structural trusses .PERIOD 
So working with bentley and microstation .PERIOD We've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses .PERIOD But each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building .PERIOD 
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components ,COMMA one to another .PERIOD 
At the same time ,COMMA there's a person paying <NUM> dollars for a 300-series car ,COMMA and a person paying <NUM> dollars for a <NUM> series .PERIOD And that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they have to also discriminate between these products .PERIOD 
To go back to architecture .PERIOD What's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design ,COMMA is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD 
And to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system .PERIOD 
With united architects also ,COMMA we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system .PERIOD But this time in a much more monolithic mass ,COMMA like a sphere .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in stockholm ,COMMA sweden or this installation wall ,COMMA in the netherlands at the netherlands ,COMMA architecture institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects ,COMMA and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material .PERIOD 
What i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer ,COMMA because i want to talk about diarrhea .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA i want to talk about the design of diarrhea .PERIOD 
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility .PERIOD Then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms .PERIOD 
So one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria ,COMMA and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water tend to be more harmful .PERIOD 
After a few days of infection you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine .PERIOD 
And if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms .PERIOD 
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number .PERIOD 
So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD 
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD 
So we don't want to run an experiment like that .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i don't know how that happened ,COMMA and i didn't have anything to do with it .PERIOD I promise you .PERIOD 
The goal is to turn this around .PERIOD 
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD 
And i want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria .PERIOD 
In the case of malaria ,COMMA what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses .PERIOD 
The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people ,COMMA that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD 
So i don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but i did want to put them up there .PERIOD Just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with .PERIOD 
And the data really do support this ,COMMA that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness .PERIOD 
Anyhow ,COMMA i'll end that there ,COMMA and thank you very much .PERIOD 
Our hands are amazing ,COMMA instruments .PERIOD 
And when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier .PERIOD 
Every time you contract a muscle ,COMMA it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate .PERIOD The motorized prosthesis .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the body works by starting a motor command in your brain ,COMMA going down your spinal cord ,COMMA out the nerves and to your periphery .PERIOD 
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you think ,COMMA close hand ,COMMA and a little section of your chest contracts .PERIOD 
And jesse's a good crane operator .PERIOD And he did okay ,COMMA by our standards .PERIOD 
So this is really exciting for us because now we have a portal ,COMMA a portal ,COMMA or a way to potentially give back sensation ,COMMA so that he might feel what he touches with his prosthetic hand .PERIOD 
We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations .PERIOD 
You had to concentrate a whole lot .PERIOD 
Then we fit her with a prosthesis .PERIOD 
A little faster and much more easy ,COMMA much more natural .PERIOD 
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more .PERIOD 
And here you can see on jesse's chest when he just tried to do three different things ,COMMA you can see three different patterns .PERIOD 
Obviously that's heavy for amanda .PERIOD 
It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train .PERIOD 
So we're really excited because now we're getting to a clinically practical device .PERIOD 
I want you to watch closely .PERIOD 
That's claudia .PERIOD And that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic .PERIOD 
Once we can do it that small .PERIOD It's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA amanda came jet-lagged ;SEMICOLON she's using the arm ,COMMA and everything goes wrong .PERIOD 
And none of those problems could i have dealt with ,COMMA but i have a really bright research team .PERIOD 
But first ,COMMA i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans ,COMMA and for the earth .PERIOD 
Because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have <NUM> billion people in the world .PERIOD And we all like to consume .PERIOD 
Humans ,COMMA without fins ,COMMA <NUM> meters ,COMMA <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
So penguins are amazing athletes .PERIOD 
And more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed .PERIOD 
If you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about <NUM> .PERIOD 
So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did .PERIOD <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
When we have extreme el nino events ,COMMA you see all this red .PERIOD And you see ,COMMA no green out here around the galapagos .PERIOD 
Things die when there's no food .PERIOD 
And if you look along the coast of argentina where i work now at a place called punta tombo -- the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about <NUM> degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here .PERIOD 
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD 
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it .PERIOD 
So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle .PERIOD And you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD 
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak .PERIOD We let him in .PERIOD And he comes in here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is turbo .PERIOD 
And now he's looking at the other guy ,COMMA saying ,COMMA you are really weird .PERIOD 
Most important thing is :COLON only you can change yourself .PERIOD And only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins .PERIOD 
But let's talk about the <NUM> percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .PERIOD 
Over <NUM> ,COMMA new countries were born .PERIOD 
And they share a lengthy land border .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the world bank predicts that russia's population is declining towards about <NUM> million people .PERIOD And there is another thing that you don't see on this map .PERIOD 
Stalin :COLON khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags ,COMMA labor camps ,COMMA nuclear cities .PERIOD Whatever the case was .PERIOD 
As a result ,COMMA in the russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of india ,COMMA you have exactly six million russians .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way .PERIOD We think about political geography .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA the <NUM> dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy .PERIOD 
And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in asia .PERIOD But potentially for the world .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .PERIOD 
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region .PERIOD 
All of this is happening .PERIOD Without firing a shot .PERIOD 
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world .PERIOD 
What i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day .PERIOD 
The kurds for <NUM> years have been waging a struggle for independence ,COMMA and now is their chance to finally have it .PERIOD 
Now remember ,COMMA kurdistan is landlocked .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA it has to have amicable relations with them .PERIOD 
The lesson ,COMMA from kurdistan and from palestine ,COMMA is that independence alone .PERIOD Without infrastructure is futile .PERIOD 
The last time ,COMMA that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire .PERIOD 
But today ,COMMA the hejaz railway lies in tatters ,COMMA ruins .PERIOD 
More :COLON pipelines means more silk roads .PERIOD Instead of the great game .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> new countries .PERIOD Joined the eu .PERIOD 
Even if these regions aren't part of the eu ,COMMA they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what's next ?QUESTIONMARK Where are we going to see borders change ?QUESTIONMARK And new countries born .PERIOD 
If we were to look at all of africa ,COMMA we could most ,COMMA certainly acknowledge ,COMMA far more ,COMMA tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD 
It has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in darfur ,COMMA which you all know about the civil war in the east of the country ,COMMA and south sudan .PERIOD 
But if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .PERIOD 
Now these animals are different from one another ,COMMA because they have different genes .PERIOD 
And we didn't study any of these animals .PERIOD 
Is it miserable ?QUESTIONMARK It doesn't seem to be .PERIOD 
And if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate .PERIOD 
And now here is the daf-2 mutant .PERIOD 
But it's really more like this .PERIOD Let's say you're a <NUM> year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating ,COMMA people .PERIOD 
She says ,COMMA i'm <NUM> .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA genes ,COMMA which are part of the dna .PERIOD They're instructions to make a protein that does something .PERIOD 
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones .PERIOD 
So after we made our discoveries with little c .PERIOD Elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking .PERIOD If we made the same daf-2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation in other animals .PERIOD Will they live longer .PERIOD 
They hardly get cancer .PERIOD And when they do ,COMMA it's not as severe .PERIOD 
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .PERIOD 
The receptor isn't working as well .PERIOD 
And many of these different genes we've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .PERIOD 
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients .PERIOD 
So he doesn't actually do anything himself .PERIOD 
We don't know the details of how this works ,COMMA but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .PERIOD 
But in this case ,COMMA there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD 
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected .PERIOD 
You could change the genes .PERIOD In principle .PERIOD 
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD 
I wasn't suggesting that i was going to go and do it ,COMMA but .PERIOD 
Just move to one side for us if you would .PERIOD 
And when you look at these <NUM> year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference .PERIOD Just by looking between those turtles and <NUM> year-old turtles .PERIOD 
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .PERIOD 
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan .PERIOD 
Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD 
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat .PERIOD Maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD 
They all have heroes who were chosen .PERIOD 
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders ,COMMA because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .PERIOD 
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy .PERIOD They're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within .PERIOD 
Which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i was privileged to train in transplantation under two great surgical pioneers :COLON thomas starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in <NUM> and sir roy calne who performed the first liver transplant in the uk .PERIOD 
In the following year .PERIOD 
But not all patients on .PERIOD The transplant .PERIOD Wait list are so fortunate .PERIOD 
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living ,COMMA related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ ,COMMA like a split liver graft ,COMMA to a relative ,COMMA or loved one .PERIOD 
No doubt i was informed ,COMMA the consent had been obtained .PERIOD 
And at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human embryonic stem cells in the 1990s .PERIOD 
And as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .PERIOD 
If this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos .PERIOD 
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease .PERIOD 
We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country venezuela ,COMMA but in our world .PERIOD 
He has given us the possibility to have dreams ,COMMA and to make true the dreams .PERIOD 
And here are the results of this wonderful project .PERIOD That is the system in venezuela .PERIOD 
He buys a ring .PERIOD She buys a dress .PERIOD 
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb .PERIOD Weight gain ,COMMA until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .PERIOD 
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .PERIOD 
What do the folks who make it ?QUESTIONMARK All the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common .PERIOD 
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .PERIOD 
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss ,COMMA because ,COMMA women ,COMMA we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men mostly care about sex .PERIOD 
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies .PERIOD 
These are couples who can find good in any situation .PERIOD 
This is an actual study ,COMMA and let me clarify .PERIOD 
Now i don't know how old all of you are ,COMMA but when i was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film .PERIOD And by god ,COMMA film was expensive .PERIOD 
I'm serious .PERIOD 
So i'm obviously going to need fatten him up .PERIOD 
I have a doppelganger .PERIOD 
That's exactly what i do -- optical mind control .PERIOD 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns .PERIOD And that's so difficult .PERIOD Chances are we'll understand these patterns just as little as the brains that produce them .PERIOD 
To make progress .PERIOD We need to break the code .PERIOD 
The approach works so well ,COMMA that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD 
These headless bodies can live for about a day .PERIOD But they don't do much .PERIOD 
Now for an intelligent being like our fly .PERIOD This policy is not written in stone ,COMMA but rather changes .PERIOD As the animal learns from experience .PERIOD 
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD 
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses ,COMMA it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment .PERIOD And then it turns around .PERIOD 
These :COLON <NUM> cells ,COMMA as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray .PERIOD 
If the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on and the fly will initiate a turn .PERIOD 
In a situation like this ,COMMA we would expect the critic to speak up and to tell the actor to change its policy .PERIOD 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again ,COMMA the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics ,COMMA as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher .PERIOD 
Now being a biologist ,COMMA i was very curious about this .PERIOD 
These are gecko toes .PERIOD 
And the individual has <NUM> billion of these nano-size split ends .PERIOD 
So what they did was they asked us an important question .PERIOD 
They're climbing up a wall or a tree .PERIOD 
Now that's real time .PERIOD You can't see anything .PERIOD 
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD 
It oscillates its tail up and down ,COMMA like a dolphin .PERIOD 
But watch its front legs .PERIOD Can you see what they are doing .PERIOD 
So now we were really confused ,COMMA because there are no reports of it gliding .PERIOD 
One of the problems is coming up with the right target .PERIOD 
There's not a lot of science behind that one either .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA why is this so complicated ?QUESTIONMARK 
Volcanoes .PERIOD Eject aerosols into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
So here's the thing .PERIOD It sounds like a simple question .PERIOD 
That's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there .PERIOD 
You can go then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this .PERIOD 
And it been growing for about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right .PERIOD 
That the place where during an earthquake in <NUM> ,COMMA this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly .PERIOD And it was lifted up about six to seven meters .PERIOD 
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD 
There's a whole family of curves here .PERIOD 
Some of the records show lower temperatures than others .PERIOD 
And there is natural variability caused by the sun .PERIOD Caused by el ninos .PERIOD 
There's consequences for carbonate organisms .PERIOD 
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .PERIOD 
And on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear ,COMMA we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed .PERIOD Caused by this transience .PERIOD 
You have to go back about <NUM> million years ,COMMA to find a time when co2 levels were double ,COMMA what they are today .PERIOD 
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now .PERIOD 
And i think that may very well be true ,COMMA so i'll close with this .PERIOD 
And a long time ago -- well ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .PERIOD 
This is donna at the statue of liberty .PERIOD 
But i'd like to talk about another way to travel .PERIOD That doesn't require a ship or an airplane .PERIOD And just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector ,COMMA and a screen .PERIOD 
And that's what i'm going to talk to you about today .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i'm the living product of two cultures coming together .PERIOD 
To change the arab nightmare into the american dream .PERIOD 
Josh rushing ,COMMA the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers -- al jazeera showed them -- it was powerful ,COMMA because america doesn't show those kinds of images .PERIOD 
And it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't ,COMMA bothered as much the night before .PERIOD 
Jehane noujaim :COLON i was overwhelmed by the response of the film ,COMMA for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there .PERIOD 
And i saw this with audiences .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA god forbid .PERIOD 
If you were not abu azzam's ,COMMA daughter .PERIOD 
In this life ,COMMA we're dead anyway .PERIOD 
Woman ,COMMA perhaps we have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD 
Zvika :COLON i said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA that's bat-chen :COLON that's my daughter .PERIOD 
Are you sure she is dead .PERIOD 
When we got to here ,COMMA we saw three israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .PERIOD 
George ,COMMA but there is a teacher that is in charge .PERIOD 
But after thinking logically about it ,COMMA i didn't find any reason why not to meet them ,COMMA and let them know of our suffering .PERIOD 
We see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot ,COMMA who lost children .PERIOD And still believe in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD 
Yes .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD 
But i've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers ,COMMA to give power to people who are trying to use film for change .PERIOD 
There's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis ,COMMA who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there .PERIOD And using this film to take to congress ,COMMA to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack .PERIOD And she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this .PERIOD 
There's working films ,COMMA and there's current tv ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put their -- yes .PERIOD It's amazing .PERIOD 
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ,COMMA to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .PERIOD 
In the year <NUM> ,COMMA a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza suggested ,COMMA a very bold ,COMMA and in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA in addition to left right back ,COMMA forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see .PERIOD 
How is it that the sun <NUM> million miles away ,COMMA [that] somehow it affects the motion of the earth .PERIOD 
He like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory .PERIOD 
Maybe i can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was at that time ,COMMA known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today .PERIOD But at that time ,COMMA that was the only other one people were thinking about .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions ,COMMA immediately arise from his observation .PERIOD 
It's very hard to see it ,COMMA though ,COMMA from far away .PERIOD 
So many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the '40s ,COMMA certainly by the '50s ,COMMA this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .PERIOD 
In our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify .PERIOD The laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world .PERIOD It's called superstring theory ,COMMA as you were indicating .PERIOD 
And there you see unification ,COMMA because matter particles ,COMMA electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles ,COMMA photons ,COMMA gravitons ,COMMA are all built up from one entity .PERIOD 
One of the other predictions of string theory -- no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory .PERIOD 
And that question is this :COLON when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years ,COMMA there appear to be about <NUM> numbers that really describe our universe .PERIOD 
Not yet .PERIOD 
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions .PERIOD 
This is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape -- name isn't all that important .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape ,COMMA interesting structure .PERIOD 
And the idea is that ,COMMA if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales .PERIOD 
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA even at this ,COMMA most fundamental level context is everything .PERIOD 
And now you see it .PERIOD 
There is no a priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a .PERIOD 
So you don't do it again .PERIOD 
Your brain is learning ,COMMA and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination .PERIOD The left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD 
I take it from your response .PERIOD They don't look the same anymore ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow ,COMMA and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .PERIOD 
Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD 
And they land on the flower :COLON they stick their tongue in there ,COMMA called a proboscis .PERIOD And they drink sugar water .PERIOD 
So they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD 
So illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art .PERIOD In the words of a more contemporary artist ,COMMA to demonstrate the fragility of our senses .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA color tells us something completely different that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is .PERIOD 
We can't instead the brain evolved to see the world ,COMMA the way it was useful to see in the past .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound ,COMMA and we enable people to hear their visual world .PERIOD 
So working with kids ,COMMA they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them .PERIOD 
So now what i want to do ,COMMA i'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them .PERIOD 
The question is ,COMMA is that an illusion .PERIOD 
And they're different .PERIOD 
And you can make your own decision .PERIOD And then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it .PERIOD 
That's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off .PERIOD 
I'll give you the short answer .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA most of the time that works .PERIOD 
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .PERIOD 
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .PERIOD 
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around .PERIOD 
When something is so common ,COMMA it's no longer news -- car crashes ,COMMA domestic violence -- those are the risks .PERIOD You worry about .PERIOD 
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD 
And there are two ways to do this .PERIOD 
Enough ,COMMA real world examples helps .PERIOD 
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious ,COMMA that it's not working properly .PERIOD 
If for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens .PERIOD It's really hard to judge .PERIOD The efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .PERIOD 
It doesn't change .PERIOD It's real .PERIOD 
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .PERIOD 
Where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK We get them from others .PERIOD 
Think of models of terrorism .PERIOD Child kidnapping ,COMMA airline safety ,COMMA car safety .PERIOD 
Models can come from industry .PERIOD 
For us ,COMMA we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD 
Now it had a name ,COMMA which made it scarier than the regular flu .PERIOD Even though it was more deadly .PERIOD 
As the novelty wore off ,COMMA the months went by .PERIOD There was some amount of tolerance .PERIOD People got used to it .PERIOD 
We have feeling model reality .PERIOD 
New models that extend long periods of time are hard .PERIOD 
Global warming is a great example .PERIOD 
Strong feelings can create a model .PERIOD 
And that's okay .PERIOD 
Now what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA i said ,COMMA feeling model reality .PERIOD I said ,COMMA reality doesn't change .PERIOD It actually does .PERIOD 
Someone else bought it and died .PERIOD 
All human life ,COMMA all life depends on plants .PERIOD 
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move ,COMMA because there might be cities and other things in the way .PERIOD 
So if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them .PERIOD 
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all around the world ,COMMA people are doing the same thing .PERIOD

Now ,COMMA south african friends will know that was very painful .PERIOD 
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals ,COMMA not between groups ,COMMA not between governments -- but it is very necessary .PERIOD

How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations ,COMMA unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem .PERIOD But part of the solution .PERIOD 
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy ,COMMA of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups .PERIOD 
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools .PERIOD We can use to strengthen our communication .PERIOD 
In my country ,COMMA i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together not as a government initiative .PERIOD But they came together on their own initiative ,COMMA to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD 
How are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues ,COMMA if we don't improve our skills of communication .PERIOD 
So i'm in chile in the atacama desert sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection ,COMMA and i have this picture up on my screen ,COMMA and a woman comes up behind me .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA excuse me .PERIOD 
This is a gentoo penguin ,COMMA and she was still skeptical .PERIOD 
So one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites .PERIOD 
And one thing that isn't a mystery actually was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid ,COMMA i'd seen these pictures -- and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA why that look on the face .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth .PERIOD 
We're trying to get all of the permissions to get everything all set to get it ,COMMA going .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .PERIOD 
Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- there's tremendous traditions :COLON there's secrecy .PERIOD 
And i'm trying to use a very scientific approach .PERIOD 
So i do a lot of work on dinosaurs .PERIOD 
Not the same one .PERIOD Actually ,COMMA this is a cast ,COMMA which i had bought .PERIOD And then after buying the cast ,COMMA i found my own .PERIOD And i don't have room for two .PERIOD 
It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD 
These days ,COMMA bits are cheap ,COMMA unfortunately .PERIOD That means you've got to spend more time sorting through them .PERIOD 
Then a little bit later ,COMMA i start getting some pictures like this .PERIOD 
That's kind of what it's like .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when i was at microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much ,COMMA that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life .PERIOD

It is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD 
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .PERIOD 
You predict a black hole ,COMMA and you look out the telescope and there it is .PERIOD Just like you said .PERIOD 
And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising .PERIOD 
And applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems .PERIOD And i didn't think this was a very likely one to call back .PERIOD So i kept on giving him to the delay list .PERIOD

So your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD It's draining them out .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
And so i gave this talk and said ,COMMA why don't you guys do this .PERIOD 
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD 
Now i want to tell you a quick story .PERIOD 
Super bowl ,COMMA i heard it over here ?QUESTIONMARK It was the date of the super bowl .PERIOD 
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .PERIOD 
But when we talked to people ,COMMA it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states .PERIOD 
But not just work ,COMMA it's within these tribes that societies get built .PERIOD That important things happen .PERIOD 
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a usc game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people ,COMMA you would ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here ,COMMA but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD 
Not all tribes are the same .PERIOD And what makes the difference is the culture .PERIOD 
This is the kid who shot up virginia tech .PERIOD 
So this other book that steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out called the three laws of performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA steve zaffron .PERIOD And i argue that as people see the world so they behave .PERIOD 
Well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that .PERIOD 
Now my birthday is coming up shortly .PERIOD And my driver's license expires .PERIOD 
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen .PERIOD 
A whole group of people communicating that way talking that way .PERIOD

It was not christmas time .PERIOD There was a christmas tree .PERIOD 
There is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage .PERIOD 
There was no road map .PERIOD No one had ever done anything like this before .PERIOD

But you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
I don't know anybody .PERIOD 
We move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe ,COMMA and then over time ,COMMA getting them connected .PERIOD 
But we're not done yet ,COMMA because then how do we go from stage four ,COMMA which is great to stage five .PERIOD 
Incidentally they did pull it off .PERIOD 
And they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD 
We're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD 
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues .PERIOD 
And in that light for the religious ,COMMA compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty .PERIOD But perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering ,COMMA in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other .PERIOD 
The communities that jean vanier founded like ,COMMA jean vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness .PERIOD 
And compassion can also have those qualities .PERIOD 
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories .PERIOD Never by statistics .PERIOD And strategies .PERIOD 
Rachel naomi remen says ,COMMA this is an important and empowering story for our time ,COMMA because this story insists that each and every one of us ,COMMA frail and flawed as we may be ,COMMA inadequate as we may feel ,COMMA has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch .PERIOD 
This is going to change science ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA and it will change religion .PERIOD 
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .PERIOD 
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction ,COMMA in the early 20th century .PERIOD 
So in this photograph ,COMMA you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .PERIOD 
And it went like this r-o-w-d-i-e that's the way we spell rowdie .PERIOD 
And i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books .PERIOD 
And i was always going off to crowded bars ,COMMA when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .PERIOD 
So even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA i'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias .PERIOD That is pretty deep and real .PERIOD In our society .PERIOD 
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD 
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .PERIOD 
And also we have this belief system right now that i call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .PERIOD 
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert ,COMMA even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable .PERIOD According to research .PERIOD 
Now i think at this point it's important for me to say that i actually love extroverts .PERIOD 
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops ,COMMA also teach us love and trust .PERIOD 
Here's margaret ,COMMA atwood cat's eye .PERIOD 
But here's the thing about my grandfather .PERIOD 
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone ,COMMA in his library .PERIOD 
And i call this my year of speaking dangerously .PERIOD 
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .PERIOD 
We need to be teaching kids to work together for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .PERIOD 
And that's okay .PERIOD 
Then about the initiative that chris mentioned ,COMMA that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 .PERIOD 
He explained to me about johann strauss ,COMMA and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD 
That's year by year .PERIOD This comes from our friends at gapmindercom .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this ,COMMA but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it ,COMMA because they're all highly commoditized .PERIOD But they're all different .PERIOD 
And the last piece ,COMMA which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many .PERIOD This is one where we seem to stand alone on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated ,COMMA end-to-end ecosystems .PERIOD 
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa in a school .PERIOD That's called nelson mandela school .PERIOD And when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal .PERIOD 
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting ,COMMA exciting activity .PERIOD 
I'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems .PERIOD 
I was eager to go off to college ,COMMA and go find girls and study and girls and study .PERIOD But then i finished college .PERIOD And i fell in love .PERIOD 
And on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm going to remind you again that each generation has to do better than the last one .PERIOD 
Just existing .PERIOD 
I really think that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention .PERIOD 
That's kind of a no-brainer .PERIOD 
So what is it for .PERIOD 
So i believe ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD 
This is not my planet .PERIOD It wasn't mine .PERIOD Before .PERIOD I was born .PERIOD 
Do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously ?QUESTIONMARK 
What we believe obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior ,COMMA and our behavior determines what we become in life .PERIOD 
My wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money .PERIOD 
We just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us .PERIOD 
Believe me ,COMMA there's a whole lot easier ways to make money .PERIOD 
The last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers .PERIOD 
And that is when my wife and i got married <NUM> years ago ,COMMA we started tithing .PERIOD 
Materialism is all about getting -- get get ;SEMICOLON get get all you ,COMMA can ,COMMA can all you get ,COMMA sit on the can .PERIOD And spoil the rest .PERIOD 
And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good ,COMMA feeling ,COMMA good and having the goods .PERIOD 
There's a chapter in the bible called psalm <NUM> .PERIOD And it's solomon's prayer ,COMMA for more influence .PERIOD 
Basically he's talking about all the marginalized in society .PERIOD 
It's a shepherd's staff .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA my god doesn't have to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA if god's going to show up ,COMMA he's not going to show up on cheese bread .PERIOD 
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off .PERIOD 
What do you do with a shepherd's staff .PERIOD 
You pull them or you poke them ,COMMA one or the other .PERIOD 
And it represents your influence .PERIOD 
And that gives with you enormous influence .PERIOD 
What are you doing with what you've been given .PERIOD 
Why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it .PERIOD 
And in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- <NUM> percent of the little girls don't go to school .PERIOD 
So in the three years ,COMMA since i talked at ted and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop .PERIOD 
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children .PERIOD And then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .PERIOD 
And that engine is going to see the results in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
They own the laptops .PERIOD They take them home .PERIOD 
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's <NUM> .PERIOD I'm in college and a friend .PERIOD And i go on a road trip from providence ,COMMA rhode island to portland ,COMMA oregon .PERIOD 
We get it in the abstract .PERIOD 
But the thing is ,COMMA the coyote runs off the cliff ,COMMA right after him .PERIOD 
That's when he falls .PERIOD 
This is not mine by the way .PERIOD 
We learn these really bad lessons really well .PERIOD 
When the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident ,COMMA he said something very interesting .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it is also why we get things wrong .PERIOD 
I just imagined it everywhere ,COMMA which has happened .PERIOD 
And the crypto-theme is ,COMMA 'i thought ,COMMA this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead' and the thing is :COLON says ,COMMA ira glass .PERIOD We need this .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA our stories are like this ,COMMA because our lives are like this .PERIOD 
And something else happened instead .PERIOD 
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- ted <NUM> -- eh .PERIOD 
We come up with another idea .PERIOD 
Bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD Bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD Bioenergy is oil .PERIOD It's gas .PERIOD It's coal .PERIOD And part of building that bridge to the future ,COMMA to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff ,COMMA is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD And to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD 
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look .PERIOD Unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots .PERIOD 
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD But as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD 
That is what bioenergy is .PERIOD It is not ethanol .PERIOD It is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD It is not importing corn into iowa because you've built so many of these ethanol plants .PERIOD It is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture ,COMMA from brute force into biological force .PERIOD And in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD 
But in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade ,COMMA at least the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil ,COMMA be that gas ,COMMA be that coal .PERIOD This is what we're dealing with .PERIOD And before i make this talk too long ,COMMA here's what's happening in the current energy system .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons .PERIOD That means ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the stuff .PERIOD We're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD And there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD There's a role in here for alternative stuff .PERIOD But we've also got to get that other portion right .PERIOD 
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .PERIOD 
In the wake of the dotcom crash and <NUM>/<NUM> san francisco bay area hotels went through ;SEMICOLON the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels .PERIOD 
And i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .PERIOD 
Each of us no matter what our role is in business has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .PERIOD 
So as i started reading more maslow ,COMMA what i started to realize is that maslow later in his life wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and specifically to business .PERIOD 
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers ,COMMA i realized we had no metrics .PERIOD 
So i went out and studied a bunch of things ,COMMA and i found a survey that showed that <NUM> percent of business leaders worldwide ,COMMA believe that the intangibles are important in their business ,COMMA things like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty .PERIOD And yet ,COMMA only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .PERIOD 
And he's a very wise man ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA listen !EXCLAMATIONMARK Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness .PERIOD 
One of those key indicators is :COLON how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or in other words ,COMMA i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification .PERIOD 
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD 
As you look at these two columns here ,COMMA doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count ,COMMA a new way to imagine what's important to us in life .PERIOD 
We're spending <NUM> billion dollars on the census .PERIOD 
We're asking ,COMMA <NUM> simple questions -- it is !EXCLAMATIONMARK Simplicity .PERIOD 
They're about demographics .PERIOD 
Abe maslow said ,COMMA long ago something you've heard before ,COMMA but you didn't realize it was him .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA if the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail .PERIOD 
In vivian's case .PERIOD Her unit of production isn't the tangible hours .PERIOD She works .PERIOD It's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .PERIOD 
He stayed there a hundred times in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .PERIOD 
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits .PERIOD We can have both .PERIOD 
At least ,COMMA as he wrote when a robot dies ,COMMA you don't have to write a letter to its mother .PERIOD 
The us is currently ahead in military robotics right now .PERIOD But we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage .PERIOD 
There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq .PERIOD While sitting at your home computer .PERIOD 
Soldiers have a name for these clips .PERIOD 
The typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits bodies burst into the air .PERIOD With the explosion .PERIOD 
It was set to music .PERIOD 
And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment .PERIOD 
That bottle winds up getting burned .PERIOD 
And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately ,COMMA and then poor people ,COMMA who ,COMMA even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened ,COMMA are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability .PERIOD 
Now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say that sure is terrible for those poor people .PERIOD 
It's just awful those poor people .PERIOD 
I hope someone does something to help them .PERIOD 
But guess what .PERIOD 
We don't have disposable resources .PERIOD 
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding ,COMMA new opportunities for action ,COMMA begin to emerge .PERIOD 
But if we want to make something hard ,COMMA we come up ,COMMA i know i'm going to make a hard substance .PERIOD 
We just had this vote ,COMMA and everybody's like well ,COMMA not in our state .PERIOD 
Just so proud .PERIOD 
But california ,COMMA though we lead the world in some of the green stuff ,COMMA we also ,COMMA unfortunately lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .PERIOD

Well ,COMMA when you start working on issues like plastic ,COMMA you realize that the whole thing is connected .PERIOD And luckily ,COMMA most of us are blessed to have two arms .PERIOD 
They'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window .PERIOD And well ,COMMA they were easy to capture .PERIOD 
I've called this vehicle ,COMMA generically ,COMMA a volantor ,COMMA after the latin word volant ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA to fly in a light ,COMMA nimble manner .PERIOD 
Volantor-like helicopter perhaps .PERIOD 
The press calls my particular volantor a skycar .PERIOD 
One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does ,COMMA and gets around in much the same way ,COMMA and it's true .PERIOD But a helicopter is a very complex device .PERIOD 
Because if you're in this world where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you can't right now ,COMMA take off from your home because it's too noisy .PERIOD 
I mean to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway .PERIOD 
You can play computer games you can sleep .PERIOD You can read on the way .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA through the various years ,COMMA we invented various vehicles .PERIOD 
Redundancy ,COMMA is the critical issue here .PERIOD 
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups .PERIOD 
That's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco .PERIOD 
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values .PERIOD Go to hell .PERIOD 
There's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it's msnbc -- in which they asked the question ,COMMA are you in the market for a volantor .PERIOD 
I mean think about how much we love this .PERIOD 
Think about that .PERIOD 
What dr .PERIOD Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way an opera ,COMMA singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room .PERIOD 
And what i'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here .PERIOD 
And if the demo gods are willing in about <NUM> seconds or so we should see it .PERIOD

We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing .PERIOD 
It runs the android operating system .PERIOD

And think of what that would do for you .PERIOD 
And third ,COMMA our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .PERIOD 
If you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death ,COMMA poison the living and further harm the environment .PERIOD 
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to ,COMMA have with our food .PERIOD 
The decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .PERIOD 
So the virtual earth initiative ,COMMA and other types of these initiatives ,COMMA are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team .PERIOD 
When we think about how all this comes together ,COMMA it's all about software algorithms and math .PERIOD 
We do this all through software ,COMMA algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .PERIOD 
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model .PERIOD 
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy .PERIOD 
Look at the skyline of shanghai .PERIOD 
The picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india .PERIOD 
In an interview printed in the financial press of india ,COMMA he said that he wants to make mumbai another shanghai .PERIOD 
This is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values .PERIOD And yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai .PERIOD 
This is a very little known fact about the two countries .PERIOD 
The economy ,COMMA grows ,COMMA government accumulates ,COMMA more resources .PERIOD And the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure ,COMMA being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD 
One reason is the east asian model .PERIOD 
Korea succeeded .PERIOD North korea .PERIOD Didn't .PERIOD 
Burma didn't succeed .PERIOD 
In china ,COMMA it's all women .PERIOD 
By looking at these two pictures ,COMMA i say ,COMMA no ,COMMA it won't overtake china for a while .PERIOD

Indira gandhi declared emergency rule in <NUM> .PERIOD

This is the grand cafe here in oxford .PERIOD 
That's its great claim to fame .PERIOD And i wanted to show it to you ,COMMA not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england ,COMMA but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last <NUM> years .PERIOD What we now call the enlightenment .PERIOD 
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity .PERIOD 
And this is what they ended up coming with .PERIOD

It's got a fan ,COMMA it's got headlights for warmth .PERIOD It's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off .PERIOD A car battery .PERIOD 
This is hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern .PERIOD But this is what the coffee shops looked like back then .PERIOD 
And one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas or their history of their best ideas .PERIOD 
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler ,COMMA and all these things .PERIOD 
But that's a key thing .PERIOD 
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues .PERIOD And everybody's like ,COMMA no ,COMMA i hadn't thought of doing that .PERIOD 
And so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbach's office ,COMMA and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking ,COMMA as we might call it now .PERIOD 
We should record it .PERIOD 
And they thought about it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess maybe you could let's run the numbers here .PERIOD 
And i bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more ,COMMA has used said device and said satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day ,COMMA or last week ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Chance ,COMMA favors the connected .PERIOD Mind .PERIOD 
My story starts way before i was born .PERIOD 
They got on and didn't know where they were going ,COMMA and ended up in canada .PERIOD 
I was <NUM> .PERIOD And i emailed professors at the local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab .PERIOD And hardly anyone responded .PERIOD 
And so i thought ,COMMA maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
And so that's the project that i pursued for that year ,COMMA and it's continuing now as well ,COMMA and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
But i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time .PERIOD So how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK 
And while i was doing this ,COMMA i was reading the cancer literature ,COMMA trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .PERIOD 
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture ,COMMA and then bone cancer arises .PERIOD 
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated .PERIOD 
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation ,COMMA we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins ,COMMA or with radiation ,COMMA trying to kill it .PERIOD 
We're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this really changed my view of looking at cancer .PERIOD 
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ ,COMMA that's what a metastasis is .PERIOD 
But then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely .PERIOD 
And i guess i'll keep investigating until i get the answers .PERIOD 
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply ?QUESTIONMARK It needs to be constantly contracting .PERIOD So therefore it's almost selfish it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD 
And i hate to say that ,COMMA but it seems as though muscle cell ,COMMA possibly because of all its use ,COMMA has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury ,COMMA to fine-tune this repair response .PERIOD And actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish .PERIOD I really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something .PERIOD The body is saying to do .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched .PERIOD But i figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at ted .PERIOD So thank you very much .PERIOD 
Some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before .PERIOD So i'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story .PERIOD 
And then my translator left .PERIOD 
They slept on the floor at night .PERIOD 
I had photographed ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA a lot of these kids .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA not at all ,COMMA shy or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything like the other children that i'd photographed .PERIOD 
It was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader .PERIOD 
And i said to my translator what's going on ,COMMA why is she crying .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA and i live in hotels ,COMMA and i'm not married .PERIOD 
And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me .PERIOD 
So i finally found myung sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school every day .PERIOD 
And i said to the translator ,COMMA what did he say .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA tell him that i am a photographer .PERIOD 
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright happy little child ,COMMA who now appeared to be very withdrawn ,COMMA being enslaved by this family .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i finally decided ,COMMA i said ,COMMA look -- this is all through the translator ,COMMA because this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't speak a word of korean -- and i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with .PERIOD 
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had <NUM> children living in his house .PERIOD 
He had kids from all over korea living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids .PERIOD 
Hyun-sook stayed at father keene's ,COMMA and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through .PERIOD 
And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day .PERIOD 
We went back to our hotel room .PERIOD And gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was .PERIOD 
And we fall asleep -- and i've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
And they always overheat the hotels in korea ,COMMA terribly .PERIOD So during the day i always left the window .PERIOD Open .PERIOD 
And i don't speak korean ,COMMA but i'm hearing these voices .PERIOD And i'm not hearing anger ,COMMA i'm hearing terror .PERIOD 
I remember his son had the ll bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces .PERIOD 
So we ran to the bathroom and got towels ,COMMA and put them over our faces ,COMMA and the kids faces .PERIOD 
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire .PERIOD 
Five people jumped and died .PERIOD Other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD 
So it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states .PERIOD 
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage .PERIOD 
And the pilot ,COMMA jeff cowley ,COMMA actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage ,COMMA after meeting ,COMMA natasha .PERIOD 
So at this point ,COMMA natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene taught her .PERIOD 
She learned english in three months .PERIOD 
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her ,COMMA and she wouldn't answer .PERIOD And they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well in the beginning .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA remember the picture ,COMMA how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning .PERIOD 
The captain of the cheerleaders .PERIOD 
This is her half-sister .PERIOD 
Natasha would you just come up for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say hello to everybody .PERIOD 
Natasha i've seen pictures millions of times ,COMMA but today was the first time .PERIOD I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation .PERIOD 
I started crying .PERIOD 
The telescope is actually built similarly ,COMMA to the well-known to you hubble space telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens ,COMMA as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD 
The way we do that ,COMMA actually is with a method ,COMMA which we call the transit method .PERIOD 
But we learn a lot from that ,COMMA not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD 
So what have we learned .PERIOD 
And we do care about planets like the earth ,COMMA because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks .PERIOD And with a lot of complex chemistry to originate ,COMMA to emerge ,COMMA to survive .PERIOD 
So today ,COMMA i'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope ,COMMA kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks .PERIOD And lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus .PERIOD 
It's about <NUM> million ,COMMA such planets .PERIOD 
So that's great ,COMMA because then we can go and study them -- remotely ,COMMA of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past .PERIOD Five years .PERIOD 
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next .PERIOD 
So the question is ,COMMA is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something which depends on the planet .PERIOD 
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities .PERIOD And there is not too much lab ,COMMA and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today .PERIOD 
And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as <NUM> years ago ,COMMA copernicus' act did by changing the way we view space and time .PERIOD 
And half the time ,COMMA what's happened is it's related this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind ,COMMA to the earth in a bigger space .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little ,COMMA small atom .PERIOD 
So what does this tell us ?QUESTIONMARK 
There is immense ,COMMA powerful potential in life .PERIOD In this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common .PERIOD 
Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one with synthetic biology ,COMMA being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD 
These ;SEMICOLON gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in <NUM> in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was .PERIOD 
Look .PERIOD India got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level .PERIOD 
And almost the same happens here .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of botswana .PERIOD 
And if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of aids .PERIOD 
In spite of pepfar ,COMMA the generous pepfar ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment .PERIOD And of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries ,COMMA only <NUM> percent are left on treatment .PERIOD After two years .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA it's not look here .PERIOD 
There's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that's not the case .PERIOD 
See the difference within one african country -- it goes from very low level to very high level .PERIOD And most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .PERIOD 
So what is it then .PERIOD 
It could be concurrency .PERIOD 
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years .PERIOD 
Let's talk about past and future billions .PERIOD 
We know that most of that wealth was made after the year <NUM> .PERIOD 
And notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland ,COMMA to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions .PERIOD 
So i'm going to translate this into language that you can understand .PERIOD 
Let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this :COLON synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process .PERIOD 
That really was a killer application .PERIOD 
Property rights ;SEMICOLON it's not the democracy ,COMMA folks .PERIOD It's having the rule of law based on private property rights .PERIOD 
Very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi's ,COMMA road .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA the work ethic .PERIOD 
He was wrong .PERIOD 
Take a look at mathematical attainment by <NUM> year-olds .PERIOD 
Now it's just five times .PERIOD And soon it will be <NUM> times .PERIOD 
And could africa get that sequencing wrong .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy .PERIOD Before you've established secure private property rights .PERIOD 
Warning that may not work .PERIOD 
That's the basis for the western model of representative government .PERIOD 
And i think these words really nail it .PERIOD It means a society ,COMMA based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD 
That's not the way history works .PERIOD 
That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions ,COMMA like civilizations .PERIOD 
What's your view on that .PERIOD 
Niall ,COMMA ferguson :COLON well ,COMMA i really am not just talking about the rise of the east .PERIOD I'm talking about the rise of the rest ,COMMA and that includes south america .PERIOD 
I once asked one of my colleagues at harvard ,COMMA hey ,COMMA is south america .PERIOD Part of the west .PERIOD 
Spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD 
Spiders are also extremely old .PERIOD 
Even fossil spiders can make silk .PERIOD As we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .PERIOD 
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for <NUM> million years .PERIOD 
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it .PERIOD 
In an orb-web-weaving spider ,COMMA you can find seven types of silk glands .PERIOD And what i have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position .PERIOD There's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD 
So silk fibers vary in their strength .PERIOD And also ,COMMA their extensibility .PERIOD 
If it wasn't able to stretch so much ,COMMA then ,COMMA basically ,COMMA when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline .PERIOD Right off of it .PERIOD 
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving .PERIOD Spiders .PERIOD 
How do groups get anything done right ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value ?QUESTIONMARK Instead of just being chaos .PERIOD 
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .PERIOD 
More recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system ,COMMA without regard to institutional models .PERIOD 
And what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself ,COMMA charming though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem right .PERIOD 
You have to have legal structure .PERIOD 
Third ,COMMA forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD 
You can't hire everyone in a company ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the flickr answer ,COMMA you can leave the people where they are .PERIOD And you take the problem to the individuals ,COMMA rather than moving the individuals to the problem .PERIOD 
In bigger systems ,COMMA the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer .PERIOD So the imbalance increases .PERIOD 
If you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for <NUM> percent of the photos .PERIOD 
We've looked at who's contributed to linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing right .PERIOD 
Do you want that patch ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub .PERIOD Or what have you .PERIOD 
Stay-at-home ,COMMA moms right .PERIOD 
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free .PERIOD 
And the answer to that question is it doesn't matter ,COMMA because that's not the right question .PERIOD 
And if there is an answer to that ,COMMA that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class .PERIOD 
They trade tips ,COMMA like if you feel like eating something ,COMMA clean a toilet or the litter box ,COMMA the feeling will pass .PERIOD 
We have an attitude that support .PERIOD Groups are inherently beneficial .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks ,COMMA and the small group wants to stay sober .PERIOD Then we think that's a great support group .PERIOD 
But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified .PERIOD 
Flavor ,COMMA is king .PERIOD Flavor .PERIOD Rules .PERIOD 
So this is the challenge for this bread .PERIOD 
And this is what every student has to begin with .PERIOD 
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a french way of saying ,COMMA get organized .PERIOD 
Everything ,COMMA in its place ,COMMA first stage .PERIOD 
Stage two is mixing ;SEMICOLON we take the ingredients and we mix them .PERIOD 
And so we ,COMMA in the mixing process ,COMMA have to develop the gluten ,COMMA we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly .PERIOD 
And at stage nine ,COMMA we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven -- stage <NUM> .PERIOD 
And the starches ,COMMA when they reach about <NUM> degrees ,COMMA gelatinize .PERIOD 
And stage <NUM> we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .PERIOD 
And we save some of those for the next generation .PERIOD 
So we turn it into flour .PERIOD 
Not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot ,COMMA but water boiled off and becoming steam .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've got now this flour .PERIOD 
And what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK We add some water .PERIOD 
Or another analogy would be :COLON a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly .PERIOD 
But we've got this bread ,COMMA and what i did here is to try to ,COMMA again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it .PERIOD The spent grain from beer-making .PERIOD 
And so this is again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread ,COMMA but a bread that you will enjoy .PERIOD 
So if i kind of break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here .PERIOD 
We'll start a little piece here ,COMMA and i'm going to take a little piece here -- i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD 
Let me give you just one example of this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the question is :COLON how could we ask them .PERIOD 
But half the time ,COMMA what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go .PERIOD Mmmmm :COLON broccoli .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA she'd act as if what she wanted was ,COMMA just the opposite of what the babies wanted .PERIOD 
The question you might ask ,COMMA though ,COMMA is ,COMMA why do children learn so much .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what kind of explanation could we have for this .PERIOD 
And essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way ,COMMA using probability theory to characterize ,COMMA describe ,COMMA the way that scientists find out about the world .PERIOD 
And some <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .PERIOD 
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with the detector will actually activate two out of three times .PERIOD 
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .PERIOD 
The first one is ,COMMA again .PERIOD Remember ,COMMA these are four year-olds .PERIOD 
They're just learning how to count .PERIOD 
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .PERIOD 
I don't know .PERIOD 
Not working either .PERIOD 
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD 
It's good to be a grownup .PERIOD 
That :COLON technology is simulating humans .PERIOD 
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .PERIOD 
I've made him run into a wall here ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD 
So we simulated that as well ,COMMA and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network ,COMMA how to walk .PERIOD 
We heard about those already yesterday ,COMMA and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already .PERIOD 
Those are then selected by the algorithm ,COMMA reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD 
Now this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important ,COMMA because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds .PERIOD 
So that's what you see here .PERIOD 
We just took this character that i just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface ,COMMA and this is what you get out of it .PERIOD 
So that you don't have a character that looks limp ,COMMA but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away ,COMMA that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD 
That's one angle .PERIOD Here's another angle .PERIOD 
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better rendered version .PERIOD 
This is incredibly quick .PERIOD This is happening in real time .PERIOD 
This is another behavior .PERIOD They requested .PERIOD 
You feel kind of sorry for the guy .PERIOD 
It's even worse -- and that is another video i just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here .PERIOD 
Now we've just tried ,COMMA and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA can we do that ourselves as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
This was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved ,COMMA i should say -- to produce balance .PERIOD Basically .PERIOD 
So that all happened automatically .PERIOD We didn't put that in there .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
You can draw as everyone should .PERIOD 
Shake it and you have a heterosexual couple .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA i'm making a very important argument .PERIOD 
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .PERIOD 
Say ,COMMA your motorcycle crashes .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA when i was offered the times column six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this :COLON you'll be sent the coolest ,COMMA hottest ,COMMA slickest new gadgets .PERIOD 
Every week ,COMMA it'll arrive at your door .PERIOD 
The job though came with one small downside ,COMMA and that is :COLON they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column .PERIOD 
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to .PERIOD 
Some of the stories are just so classic ,COMMA and yet so understandable .PERIOD 
And the technician's like ,COMMA ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices ,COMMA where there are so many features and options ,COMMA you have to do two dimensions .PERIOD You know ,COMMA a vertical and a horizontal .PERIOD You guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically .PERIOD 
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .PERIOD 
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD So what is the answer ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm sorry .PERIOD It's not one yet .PERIOD 
You have to scroll ,COMMA like ,COMMA seven screens-full to get to it .PERIOD 
It's like a <NUM> shuttle .PERIOD Cockpit .PERIOD 
You do not .PERIOD 
We've entered .PERIOD Planet domination mode .PERIOD 
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't .PERIOD They're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old <NUM> chassis .PERIOD 
I liked the media center .PERIOD Pc .PERIOD I liked the microsoft spot .PERIOD Watch .PERIOD 
The lesson was ,COMMA simplicity sells .PERIOD 
Here's another example ,COMMA chris .PERIOD You're the source of all power .PERIOD 
In my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software ,COMMA and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .PERIOD 
I also use this feature called voice macros ,COMMA period .PERIOD 
Correct dissuade ?QUESTIONMARK Not just .PERIOD 
No new features :COLON it's never happened before in software .PERIOD 
It could be the design of the thing you're using .PERIOD 
But i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies ,COMMA became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD 
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing .PERIOD Because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage ,COMMA causes a trillion dollar response ,COMMA which is largely ineffective .PERIOD And arguably ,COMMA probably almost certainly has made the problem worse .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .PERIOD 
Things where you know a factor of <NUM> difference ,COMMA can make a factor of <NUM> difference in the outcome .PERIOD 
The first is this whole area of education .PERIOD And it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer .PERIOD 
I think the challenge for us is -- i'm very certain that that will happen .PERIOD The challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device .PERIOD 
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them .PERIOD 
So given that we know and should believe -- because moore's law's been like a constant .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress over the last <NUM> years or whatever .PERIOD 
We have a challenge ,COMMA because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time .PERIOD People are moving to the cities .PERIOD 
And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover ,COMMA as we start to engineer at the nano scale .PERIOD 
We believe that genentech the compaq ,COMMA the lotus ,COMMA the sun ,COMMA the netscape ,COMMA the amazon .PERIOD The google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD 
And to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $400 million fund ,COMMA so this for us is a very substantial fund .PERIOD 
And what we did over the last few months -- well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA ray kurzweil ,COMMA and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the <NUM> genome was very dangerous .PERIOD 
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains .PERIOD 
We believe that if we could fill these <NUM> gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic .PERIOD 
So we're very excited because we think we can fund <NUM> or speed up .PERIOD <NUM> projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this .PERIOD 
But above all ,COMMA what we have to do is we have to help the good guys ,COMMA the people on the defensive side ,COMMA have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things .PERIOD 
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute .PERIOD We go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping ,COMMA and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet .PERIOD 
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there ,COMMA we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go ,COMMA look for life on other planets .PERIOD 
Particularly mars ,COMMA but also europa ,COMMA the small icy moon around jupiter .PERIOD 
We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond .PERIOD 
I think myself that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD 
It's going to be everywhere .PERIOD We look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .PERIOD 
So this is a very bold statement .PERIOD 
How do you know it when you find it .PERIOD 
Very critically ,COMMA how do we protect it ?QUESTIONMARK If we find it and not contaminate it .PERIOD 
If i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate ,COMMA within about four or five hours ,COMMA i would have to see growth .PERIOD 
So they are intrinsically ,COMMA a slower life-form .PERIOD 
It's a very simple trick ,COMMA and i never fail to do it when i'm sitting in a window seat .PERIOD 
This is regularly several hundred parts per million .PERIOD 
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD 
And so one can send a thousand of them ,COMMA as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay .PERIOD That was used for one of the current mer rovers .PERIOD 
The question as to whether there is life on mars that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know from mars ,COMMA meteorites that have made it to earth ,COMMA that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD 
One of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is ,COMMA if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as i fully expect that we will is that a second genesis of life .PERIOD 
Did it start there and get transported here ?QUESTIONMARK 
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer .PERIOD These questions .PERIOD 
For real -- you can take a second .PERIOD You've got to feel this to learn it .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .PERIOD 
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles ,COMMA he would not reveal exactly where the building was ,COMMA and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .PERIOD 
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .PERIOD 
There are very few places in the us where you can try real kobe ,COMMA and one of them is wolfgang .PERIOD Puck's restaurant ,COMMA cut in los angeles .PERIOD 
It was like ,COMMA <NUM> dollars for this .PERIOD 
And then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their purpose had been served .PERIOD And so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment .PERIOD To me .PERIOD 
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties .PERIOD 
And it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit and it smelled good .PERIOD But i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face .PERIOD Today .PERIOD 
These ones gq did spring for -- i own these -- but i will tell you ,COMMA not only did i not get a compliment from any of you ,COMMA i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these .PERIOD 
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans .PERIOD And people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .PERIOD 
But anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD 
And you spend a third of your life in bed .PERIOD 
This is tom cruise arriving at the mission .PERIOD Impossible iii premiere .PERIOD 
When he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it .PERIOD Mission .PERIOD Impossible iv .PERIOD 
There was one object that i could not get my hands on ,COMMA and that was the <NUM> cheval blanc .PERIOD 
And it was an invitation ,COMMA you do not refuse .PERIOD 
Earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for <NUM> ,COMMA real dollars .PERIOD 
And this is a titan class ship in the space game eve online .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA gives you great powers .PERIOD 
Your ambition is satisfied .PERIOD But it's very beautiful .PERIOD 
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement .PERIOD 
But this isn't the really interesting stuff .PERIOD 
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it .PERIOD 
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them .PERIOD 
This sounds immensely boring ,COMMA but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling .PERIOD 
But we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD 
And also we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters ?QUESTIONMARK 
They're not rational about probability .PERIOD 
It's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD I'm going to give up .PERIOD 
And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world in particular ways .PERIOD 
So you give people lots and lots of different tasks .PERIOD 
Third :COLON you reward effort .PERIOD 
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the uk ,COMMA where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD 
And the success rate is at close to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Let's start with business .PERIOD 
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid .PERIOD 
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating .PERIOD 
There's definitely hunger in america .PERIOD <NUM> million people and almost <NUM> million children .PERIOD 
Hunger ,COMMA definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally .PERIOD But it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD 
Well they're both about food .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in america who actually ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA when i spend time in the midwest ,COMMA are pretty large in general .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity .PERIOD 
Not to beat a dead horse .PERIOD But this is a global food system ,COMMA where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese .PERIOD 
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods .PERIOD 
Another thing that's become incredibly global ,COMMA is production of meat and fish .PERIOD 
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .PERIOD 
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD 
Now there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do ,COMMA like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD 
Take joint positions with your client .PERIOD 
Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation .PERIOD 
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building .PERIOD 
The architectural manifestation was ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA just dumb .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it really was the clients who had to do it .PERIOD 
They had to make a decision .PERIOD Based on the positions ,COMMA we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds :COLON capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure ,COMMA to actually the inverse ,COMMA two-thirds ,COMMA infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture .PERIOD 
Now that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time .PERIOD 
But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform .PERIOD But multi-processional sequences .PERIOD 
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen .PERIOD 
There ,COMMA you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium .PERIOD 
Meaning nothing that we do .PERIOD Can we be the first ones to do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now if i'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together .PERIOD 
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber ,COMMA aida ,COMMA their elephants .PERIOD You can bring the elephants in .PERIOD 
Et !EXCLAMATIONMARK Voila !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
This is the at&ampt performing arts :COLON center's dee and charles wyly theater .PERIOD 
But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with .PERIOD 
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made .PERIOD 
I have many of these books ,COMMA and i've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years .PERIOD 
And i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life .PERIOD 
As opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest .PERIOD 
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes ,COMMA searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel and i am feeling .PERIOD And when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD 
And when that happens ,COMMA these montage compositions are automatically created ,COMMA which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD 
I'm <NUM> ,COMMA and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD 
I feel sassy .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA we feel fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD 
And the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here ,COMMA waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD And when it does ,COMMA it throws a harpoon at it ,COMMA and then hauls the whale up under the ice ,COMMA and cuts it up .PERIOD 
They have colors ,COMMA what do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is in the patkotak's family living room in their house in barrow ,COMMA the boxed wine ,COMMA they served us .PERIOD 
Cigarette break outside -- i don't smoke .PERIOD 
So you have some really happy person holding <NUM> balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon .PERIOD 
A 16-year-old student .PERIOD 
I asked her about that ,COMMA and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married because in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in bhutan as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end .PERIOD And so she had no interest in that .PERIOD 
A 37-year-old road worker .PERIOD 
His wish was to make some money and open a store .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to .PERIOD 
I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
Jonathan harris :COLON maybe you'll die .PERIOD Woman :COLON yes .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA but -- yeah ?QUESTIONMARK Ok .PERIOD Do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for <NUM> years ,COMMA or to live for one year ?QUESTIONMARK 
Woman ,COMMA yes ,COMMA from then .PERIOD I'm going to the heaven .PERIOD 
You can start to see some familiar balloons here .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the approach that we took was the other way around .PERIOD 
What you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD 
It's made of paper and paper .PERIOD Of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper ,COMMA cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth .PERIOD And the wine wicks all over everything .PERIOD 
So the production capability is there .PERIOD 
And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper .PERIOD 
You can't manipulate it very well .PERIOD Although i'll show something about that in a moment .PERIOD 
So you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations ,COMMA you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out the blood cells ,COMMA lets the serum go through .PERIOD And you get a series of colors ,COMMA down in the bottom .PERIOD There .PERIOD 
Turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars ,COMMA that indicate how things work .PERIOD 
I don't know whether the idea of one computer ,COMMA one child makes any sense .PERIOD Here's the computer of the future ,COMMA because this screen is already there ,COMMA and they're ubiquitous .PERIOD 
The answer is that what you do ,COMMA and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate .PERIOD You take several different layers of paper ,COMMA each one containing its own little fluid system .PERIOD And you separate them by pieces of ,COMMA literally ,COMMA double-sided carpet tape ,COMMA the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD 
But that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem .PERIOD Because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease ,COMMA and this will work in due course .PERIOD 
Now i have one last two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business .PERIOD 
We were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was eggbeater as centrifuge .PERIOD 
We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .PERIOD 
Why are we spending $135 billion .PERIOD 
In the fourth act with our hubris ,COMMA our overconfidence developing ,COMMA we invaded iraq and afghanistan .PERIOD And in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess .PERIOD 
When i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 ,COMMA what i saw was scenes like this .PERIOD 
In sangin where i was sick in <NUM> .PERIOD The nearest health clinic was within three days walk .PERIOD 
And the same is true for the troops .PERIOD 
And the reason i'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened ,COMMA and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph ,COMMA taken with me .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is not to say ,COMMA afghanistan is a place full of people like ,COMMA mullah mustafa .PERIOD 
I ran a center at harvard from <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD And there were people like michael semple ,COMMA there ,COMMA who speak afghan languages fluently ,COMMA who've traveled to almost every district in the country .PERIOD 
You feel deep ,COMMA deep ,COMMA guilt .PERIOD 
The average british soldier is on a tour of only six months italian soldiers ,COMMA on tours of four months ,COMMA the american military on tours of <NUM> months .PERIOD 
So we need to change that institutional culture .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals .PERIOD 
Borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down .PERIOD 
If what we're interested in is regional stability ,COMMA egypt is far more important .PERIOD 
Just briefly ,COMMA what's your take on the current events there ,COMMA and the intervention .PERIOD 
What we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the un .PERIOD Resolution .PERIOD 
For the first time in the united states ,COMMA a predominantly white group of voters ,COMMA voted for an african-american candidate for president .PERIOD 
But really the question here -- obama did relatively well ,COMMA in kansas .PERIOD 
Actually we didn't ask them ,COMMA but when they conducted exit polls in every state in <NUM> states out of the <NUM> .PERIOD They asked a question that was pretty direct about race .PERIOD 
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .PERIOD 
But you see democrats versus republican ,COMMA not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .PERIOD 
And likewise ,COMMA they asked not in <NUM> .PERIOD But in the same survey in <NUM> .PERIOD Would you not vote for a qualified black ?QUESTIONMARK President .PERIOD 
I'm a big fan of cities .PERIOD 
And it was followed a year or two later by laennec ,COMMA discovering the stethoscope .PERIOD 
It's been on calendars ,COMMA postage stamps in many different countries .PERIOD 
I call it the ipatient .PERIOD 
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level .PERIOD They had no need to touch her breasts .PERIOD 
But to her ,COMMA it mattered deeply .PERIOD 
We marry ,COMMA for example ,COMMA with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .PERIOD 
I would feel the abdomen .PERIOD 
I remember so many huge ,COMMA hollowed out ,COMMA haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed .PERIOD This ritual .PERIOD 
It was an offering ,COMMA an invitation .PERIOD 
It's the -- it's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .PERIOD 
You could dowse for all sorts of things .PERIOD But this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers .PERIOD 
So the way it works is ,COMMA you go down the hallway ,COMMA and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker .PERIOD And then you open the locker .PERIOD 
No it -- well ,COMMA it has kind of a right-leaning bias .PERIOD 
You can say a miracle occurs .PERIOD 
Whereas -- and it's true ,COMMA scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is .PERIOD We'll just call it this -- it's the beginning of the causal chain for science .PERIOD 
You don't even need photoshop .PERIOD You don't need high-tech equipment ,COMMA you don't need computers .PERIOD 
In the case of galileo he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn .PERIOD 
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data ,COMMA you can't have a good theory .PERIOD 
And it wasn't solved until <NUM> .PERIOD 
And so you're reducing the quality of your data .PERIOD 
Virgin mary in clearwater florida .PERIOD 
Here's the virgin mary on the backside ,COMMA which they started to wipe off .PERIOD 
And in england ,COMMA there's a pop singer .PERIOD 
In america ,COMMA it would be ,COMMA we're <NUM> light years from the edge .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA if we can do that ,COMMA then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
That is the primary function of an incubator .PERIOD 
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem .PERIOD 
He connected with people who cared about this .PERIOD Nonprofessionals ,COMMA people with passion .PERIOD 
Henry :COLON ford comes up with a really cool idea .PERIOD 
It enables him to hire men who used to get paid <NUM> cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .PERIOD

You know ,COMMA the pirate tribe is a fascinating .PERIOD One .PERIOD 
So when al gore set out to change the world again ,COMMA he didn't do it by himself .PERIOD 
What kevin kelley has taught us ,COMMA is ,COMMA you just need ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough ,COMMA that they will get you the next round and the next round .PERIOD And the next round .PERIOD 
The .PERIOD Beatles did not .PERIOD Invent teenagers .PERIOD 
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue .PERIOD 
I see what the status quo is .PERIOD I don't like it .PERIOD 
Someone stands up and says ,COMMA this one is important .PERIOD 
Because if you're not upsetting anyone ,COMMA you're not changing the status quo .PERIOD 
Because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who ,COMMA and the leading part -- is where change comes .PERIOD 
So here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD The first thing is :COLON they challenge the status quo .PERIOD 
The second thing is ,COMMA they build a culture .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD I appreciate it .PERIOD 
They have different interests .PERIOD They have divergent values .PERIOD 
They were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif ,COMMA al mutawa .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the <NUM> is not just a comic book .PERIOD

Now while 4shbab and the <NUM> may look new and shiny ,COMMA there is actually a very long tradition of this .PERIOD

This is tootsie's orchid lounge in nashville .PERIOD 
And the size of the room is not that big .PERIOD 
He wanted a bigger band .PERIOD 
The halls got bigger .PERIOD Carnegie hall's ,COMMA fair-sized .PERIOD 
And they're a lot more reverberant than la scala .PERIOD 
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics ,COMMA which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music .PERIOD 
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .PERIOD 
And he's singing right into your ear .PERIOD 
He's whispering into your ears .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there's venues like this ,COMMA a discotheque ,COMMA and there's jukeboxes in bars ,COMMA where you don't even need to have a band .PERIOD 
And as with jazz ,COMMA the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .PERIOD 
So that doesn't really work .PERIOD 
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD 
It's adaptive .PERIOD 
And i'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into that is instinctively and intuitively created .PERIOD First .PERIOD 
We sing .PERIOD 
And like the birds ,COMMA the joy is still there .PERIOD Even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .PERIOD 
As a clergyman ,COMMA you can imagine how out of place i feel .PERIOD 
And i was so stimulated .PERIOD 
But some years ago ,COMMA i was on an elevator in philadelphia ,COMMA coming down .PERIOD 
But i was on an airplane in the east some years ago ,COMMA and the man sitting across the aisle .PERIOD From me ,COMMA was the mayor of charlotte ,COMMA north carolina .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA your sermons have certainly helped me .PERIOD 
But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution .PERIOD 
A man by the name of david ,COMMA came to the throne .PERIOD And king david became one of the great leaders of his generation .PERIOD

And yet he says he restores my soul .PERIOD 
We can't get along with other people ,COMMA even in our own families .PERIOD

As the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote ,COMMA he said ,COMMA there's every activity under heaven .PERIOD 
Was there a god .PERIOD 
The reality of this life ,COMMA and his resurrection is the hope of mankind .PERIOD

The women's chief of the village has this little girl fair color ,COMMA like me ,COMMA totally dirty .PERIOD 
I wish to go to school .PERIOD 
Several years ago ,COMMA a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .PERIOD 
Today we've worked with over <NUM> .PERIOD 
This is the dream of the african girl .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA the vision of a great future ,COMMA or the dream of a great future is just a dream ,COMMA because you have all of these vices .PERIOD 
This is a real rural village .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that was the advice that st benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .PERIOD 
Up until that moment ,COMMA i had been that classic corporate warrior -- i was eating too much .PERIOD I was drinking too much .PERIOD I was working too hard ,COMMA and i was neglecting the family .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in .PERIOD 
It's in their nature ;SEMICOLON it's in their dna .PERIOD It's what they do -- even the good ,COMMA well-intentioned companies .PERIOD

Now that can be daunting .PERIOD 
As i was walking out of his bedroom .PERIOD He said ,COMMA dad ,COMMA i went yes ,COMMA mate .PERIOD

And in the fall i'm actually going to -- i exchange marriage vows with my beloved .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
One out of four south bronx children has asthma .PERIOD 
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed .PERIOD 
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx .PERIOD 
And luckily ,COMMA for me that home and the love inside of it ,COMMA along with help from teachers ,COMMA mentors and friends along the way ,COMMA was enough .PERIOD 
Are these factors taken into consideration .PERIOD When land-use policy is decided .PERIOD 
Once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA i know chris told us not to do pitches up here ,COMMA but since i have all of your attention ,COMMA we need investors .PERIOD End of pitch .PERIOD 
Anyway -- ok .PERIOD Katrina prior to katrina .PERIOD The south bronx and new orleans' ,COMMA ninth .PERIOD Ward had a lot in common .PERIOD Both were largely populated by poor people of color ,COMMA both hotbeds of cultural innovation .PERIOD Think hip-hop and jazz .PERIOD 
In the post-katrina era ,COMMA we have still more in common .PERIOD 
Neither the destruction of the ninth ward ,COMMA nor the south bronx was inevitable .PERIOD 
At present that's not happening in new york city .PERIOD 
And although less than <NUM> percent of south ,COMMA bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit .PERIOD 
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD 
But one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD 
He looked at the demographics .PERIOD 
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three ,COMMA outlawed parking on those streets ,COMMA expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes ,COMMA created public plazas ,COMMA created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD 
I don't think he understood that i wasn't asking for funding .PERIOD 
This is more or less what we saw last year .PERIOD And this is how it will go on into the future .PERIOD 
Because you see ,COMMA now ,COMMA i presented statistics that don't exist .PERIOD 
And this is gdp per capita on this axis .PERIOD 
The last century <NUM> was bad for the kids in europe .PERIOD Because most of this statistics is europe .PERIOD 
And this is the united states moving away here ,COMMA earning more money .PERIOD 
Let us have a look at the united states .PERIOD 
Within some years chile may have better child survival than the united states .PERIOD 
That's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota .PERIOD 
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .PERIOD 
Sweden was like ghana .PERIOD 
Because i have to show you one of the other facilities .PERIOD 
We can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am i choosing here ?QUESTIONMARK 
And there we are <NUM> .PERIOD 
The world is quite a messy place .PERIOD 
This is two to five dollars .PERIOD You have a bed .PERIOD 
I lectured on this for ikea ,COMMA and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here .PERIOD 
I would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And that's good ,COMMA it gets two plusses .PERIOD 
Environment is very ,COMMA very crucial .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA it's human rights .PERIOD 
And culture culture is the most important thing .PERIOD I would say ,COMMA because that's what brings joy to life .PERIOD 
Even african countries can achieve this .PERIOD 
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious .PERIOD 
And so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level ,COMMA you would with art with a capital a .PERIOD

Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA it's not marketing .PERIOD There's a very interesting car concept here ,COMMA but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .PERIOD 
It's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car ,COMMA and takes over people like me .PERIOD 
And we tell other people do this :COLON do this ?QUESTIONMARK Do this ?QUESTIONMARK Until this thing comes alive .PERIOD 
We are completely infected ,COMMA and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness .PERIOD It's quite wonderful .PERIOD 
Now now i get to the point .PERIOD I want to talk about cars as art .PERIOD 
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty .PERIOD 
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing .PERIOD 
Toothbrush ,COMMA cool .PERIOD 
I heard today about joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction .PERIOD 
This is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this ,COMMA because their life is wrapped up in that too .PERIOD 
This is <NUM> .PERIOD We did this project .PERIOD And so we sent them off with this team name ,COMMA deep blue .PERIOD Now ,COMMA many people know deep blue from ibm -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers .PERIOD 
And a group of engineers worked in germany ,COMMA and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the suv .PERIOD 
They would come together ,COMMA compare notes then they would work apart ,COMMA come together .PERIOD And they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .PERIOD 
The bathroom was so big .PERIOD She built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what i didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was -- these guys ,COMMA they can't even like ,COMMA talk to each other under those conditions .PERIOD 
There was a whole lot of dialog .PERIOD 
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .PERIOD 
Dialog kept on going with mental maps of words .PERIOD And pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA i was seriously being baffled with bullshit .PERIOD 
Because of course ,COMMA they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts ,COMMA pictures -- everything i wanted .PERIOD They'd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start .PERIOD Because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that they couldn't do problem creating .PERIOD 
It's true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD 
We didn't sequence his genome .PERIOD 
And the reason is that cancer ,COMMA like every cell in the body places little molecular bookmarks ,COMMA little post-it notes ,COMMA that remind the cell i'm cancer .PERIOD I should keep growing .PERIOD 
We just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD 
And as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar :COLON this rapid growth ,COMMA faded .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell ,COMMA from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of chicago fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD 
This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company called tensha therapeutics .PERIOD 
I've never seen really anywhere .PERIOD This unique support for cancer research .PERIOD 
The age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years .PERIOD 
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you .PERIOD 
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster .PERIOD 
That kind of makes sense to us .PERIOD 
The air in this room is very smooth .PERIOD 
In particular things were a lot denser .PERIOD 
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies :COLON a hundred billion stars ,COMMA each .PERIOD 
We'd like to understand that .PERIOD 
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem ,COMMA was richard feynman .PERIOD 
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding .PERIOD 
It's not true that we've figured it out by now .PERIOD 
The reason the problem has gotten worse ,COMMA rather than better ,COMMA is because in <NUM> we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before .PERIOD 
And so even though the universe will last forever ,COMMA and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away ,COMMA there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD 
It will probably increase and the probability is enormously huge .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD 
Occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA your homework assignment is to really think about this to contemplate what it means .PERIOD 
I just showed you this picture .PERIOD 
They all happen over a period of time ,COMMA equal to <NUM> ,COMMA to the <NUM> to the <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So here's two questions for you .PERIOD 
Maybe there is something that naturally through the growth of the laws of physics gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .PERIOD 
My bold speculation ,COMMA is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD 
And <NUM> years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .PERIOD 
This is a prediction .PERIOD I might be wrong .PERIOD 
I would like to share that story today .PERIOD 
Like everyone else .PERIOD We grew maize .PERIOD 
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school .PERIOD So i was determined to do anything possible to receive education .PERIOD 
So i went to a library .PERIOD 
So i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans ,COMMA and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .PERIOD 
God .PERIOD Bless .PERIOD 
Unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use .PERIOD 
A gesture of namaste ,COMMA maybe to respect someone or maybe -- in india .PERIOD I don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD 
So i was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and i actually wanted more .PERIOD So i borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and i now had four rollers .PERIOD 
What i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .PERIOD 
What we are interested in is information .PERIOD 
So i thought around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- i started thinking ,COMMA why can i not take this approach in the reverse way .PERIOD 
But later ,COMMA i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels .PERIOD Also .PERIOD 
You stop by a wall and start painting on that wall .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA technically ,COMMA it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use ,COMMA in some sense .PERIOD 
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket .PERIOD You can just do the gesture of taking a photo .PERIOD And it takes a photo for you .PERIOD 
Once it has that information ,COMMA it finds out more reviews about that .PERIOD Or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that .PERIOD So you can actually hear on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound .PERIOD 
So i was seeing the live [video] of his talk ,COMMA outside on just a newspaper .PERIOD 
So what i did here is remove the camera -- all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD 
And i am a wilderness explorer in tribe .PERIOD <NUM>) .PERIOD And you can ,COMMA of course ,COMMA play games .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA this looks nice .PERIOD Let me print it out that thing .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
This is incredible really .PERIOD 
And now if you see it's more about the cost-effectiveness :COLON this system costs you $300 compared to the $20000 surface tables ,COMMA or anything like that .PERIOD 
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5000 .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,COMMA and you know who ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA charles :COLON darwin .PERIOD 
Taste for both natural beauty .PERIOD And for the arts travel across cultures ,COMMA with great ease .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure ,COMMA belongs to our evolved human psychology .PERIOD 
Now keeping these ideas firmly in mind ,COMMA we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination ,COMMA even obsession in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance .PERIOD So to speak .PERIOD 
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .PERIOD 
Their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials and ,COMMA above all ,COMMA their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes .PERIOD Even today .PERIOD 
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence ,COMMA fine ,COMMA motor control ,COMMA planning ability .PERIOD Conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .PERIOD 
So before i talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .PERIOD 
So it's a small tablet ,COMMA has many holes in it ,COMMA and compressed air comes out .PERIOD So it can actually draw images .PERIOD 
And he's [unclear] following that van .PERIOD That's out in front of him .PERIOD 
So since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters ,COMMA emails ,COMMA phone calls from people from all around the world .PERIOD 
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .PERIOD 
Why do we call it that .PERIOD 
I don't know taiwan straits .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA we couldn't do iraq .PERIOD 
You have to create internal partners ,COMMA you have to access coalition partners .PERIOD 
We asked the russians for <NUM> .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
Like saddam like mugabe like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .PERIOD 
Like the <NUM> dead ,COMMA so far in sudan .PERIOD 
And let's call this red line .PERIOD I don't know .PERIOD Mission accomplished .PERIOD 
What we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force .PERIOD 
You've got to track coalition partners .PERIOD Create a record of success .PERIOD 
So they start moving from reality towards desire ,COMMA and they create their own special language .PERIOD To describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization .PERIOD 
We bought one military and we operated another .PERIOD 
I used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s .PERIOD 
Bad ,COMMA pentagon .PERIOD Bad .PERIOD 
It elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy ,COMMA because that's how you're going to shrink that gap .PERIOD 
A department of war ,COMMA a department of everything else .PERIOD 
Our long-term rationale becomes .PERIOD We're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets .PERIOD 
The question is ,COMMA how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable ,COMMA and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet .PERIOD 
Just be grateful .PERIOD Robert :COLON reed didn't shove that bomb up his ass .PERIOD 
I love this force .PERIOD I don't want to see it .PERIOD Go .PERIOD 
What does this mean in terms of operations .PERIOD 
The force on the right in and out .PERIOD 
The force on the right's going to obliterate it .PERIOD 
Different definitions of network ,COMMA centricity .PERIOD 
But ultimately ,COMMA you're going to civilianize it .PERIOD Probably two thirds .PERIOD 
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .PERIOD 
The point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command .PERIOD 
See me now don't talk about it later .PERIOD 
The world is my playground .PERIOD 
I want the rules to be as loose as possible .PERIOD 
The town was burned down .PERIOD It was in the middle of winter ,COMMA and it was a very ,COMMA very severe winter .PERIOD 
And that's what we're going through at this time .PERIOD 
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because i think i know very little about that -- i'm not a biologist -- so everything i know about ,COMMA it can be said ,COMMA in one minute .PERIOD 
But that's hard to do ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA the ice is thick .PERIOD 
But we can look outside ,COMMA very cheaply and in a simple fashion .PERIOD 
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy ,COMMA but it happened .PERIOD 
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .PERIOD 
The sunlight in jupiter on the satellites of jupiter ,COMMA is <NUM> times fainter than it is here since jupiter ,COMMA is five times ,COMMA as far from the sun .PERIOD 
This was -- originally ,COMMA when radio astronomy began ,COMMA mr .PERIOD Jansky at the bell labs ,COMMA detected radio waves ,COMMA coming from the sky .PERIOD 
Since there was nothing there .PERIOD You might as well .PERIOD Not look .PERIOD 
There is something called pit lamping .PERIOD 
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD 
I call these creatures .PERIOD Sunflowers .PERIOD 
If we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves .PERIOD 
In the long run ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there .PERIOD 
But in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And i realized then i had to go to design school .PERIOD 
Or what's this num lock key for ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA that thing .PERIOD 
And i didn't want to be a colorist .PERIOD 
And that allows me to check my timer discretely .PERIOD Here ,COMMA without bending my elbow .PERIOD 
And something a little bit more experimental .PERIOD This is a light fixture for swarovski .PERIOD And what it does is it changes shape .PERIOD 
And the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm ,COMMA sort of glowing kind of mood light .PERIOD All the way to a bright work light .PERIOD 
I want to point at something here on the left .PERIOD 
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .PERIOD 
The bottles connect together ,COMMA and you can create different shapes ,COMMA different forms .PERIOD 
And then the integration of all these great technologies ,COMMA which you've heard about the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen ,COMMA which you can read in sunlight ;SEMICOLON the keyboard ,COMMA which is made out of rubber ,COMMA and it's protected from the environment .PERIOD 
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom ,COMMA you can just say you like the design .PERIOD 
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions .PERIOD 
I was born and raised here in india ,COMMA and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down ,COMMA pat us on the head and then say to my parents ,COMMA with no problem at all poor things ,COMMA you only have three daughters .PERIOD 
Late that night ,COMMA i heard my mother begging my father ,COMMA please do something ramu .PERIOD Can't you intervene ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is tradition .PERIOD 
She said to me ,COMMA it is not about the burka .PERIOD 
Had i heard right .PERIOD 
She is on the taliban's hit list .PERIOD 
Their path is their own .PERIOD And it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different .PERIOD 
Their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem ,COMMA a bosnian love song and serbian duets .PERIOD 
In the middle ages ,COMMA troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing their verses :COLON lesbor travels through the balkans .PERIOD Like this singing ,COMMA connecting people divided by religion ,COMMA nationality and language .PERIOD 
The world ,COMMA layma bowie was given was a world at war .PERIOD 
At the next friday ,COMMA sermon ,COMMA the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque ,COMMA began to share their distress at the state of affairs .PERIOD 
In a now famous cnn clip .PERIOD You can see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms ,COMMA linked .PERIOD 
The police are called in to physically remove the women .PERIOD 
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles .PERIOD Women like sakena and leah and layma -- but also women like sonia ,COMMA gandhi here in india and michelle :COLON bachelet in chile and shirin ebadi in iran -- are doing something else .PERIOD 
And the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca .PERIOD And visit the kaaba ,COMMA the holiest shrine of islam .PERIOD 
And i did that !EXCLAMATIONMARK I put on my ritualistic dress ;SEMICOLON i went to the holy mosque ;SEMICOLON i did my prayers ;SEMICOLON i observed all the rituals .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD 
And i think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of islam .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA the westerners ,COMMA who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily .PERIOD Conclude that this is what islam ordains .PERIOD 
And the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen ,COMMA by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab ,COMMA the islamic head cover .PERIOD 
Let me give you an example in turkey where i come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic .PERIOD Until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads ,COMMA and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it .PERIOD 
Which means that muslims can today look at those things and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD 
And even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam -- which is actually a practice that i think is against islam .PERIOD But some ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA extremists did not think that way .PERIOD 
And i think the west ,COMMA at least some powers in the west ,COMMA particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators ,COMMA thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization ,COMMA thanks to the market economy ,COMMA thanks to the rise of a middle-class ,COMMA we in turkey .PERIOD See what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism .PERIOD 
As a photographer for national geographic ,COMMA i've portrayed it for many .PERIOD 
And where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges life .PERIOD 
Shallow seas nurtured life early on ,COMMA and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD 
The fundamental forms of ferns followed to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .PERIOD 
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era .PERIOD 
Jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar ,COMMA and the center of brazil ,COMMA where plants called cycads remain rock hard .PERIOD 
Flamingos ,COMMA covered continents ,COMMA migrations got underway .PERIOD 
Water lilies were among the first .PERIOD 
In africa ,COMMA gondwana molded proteas .PERIOD 
Tropical rainforests arose .PERIOD Sparking new layers of interdependence .PERIOD

An asteroid hits ,COMMA and the world went down in flames .PERIOD 
Primates emerge from jungles ,COMMA as tarsiers first ,COMMA becoming lemurs not much later .PERIOD 
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .PERIOD 
Today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .PERIOD 
But let's start at the beginning .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA notwithstanding ,COMMA the gloomy pictures from the middle east ,COMMA darfur ,COMMA iraq ,COMMA elsewhere ,COMMA there is a longer-term trend that does represent .PERIOD Some good news .PERIOD 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be .PERIOD 
Thus ,COMMA even though every civilian killed ,COMMA maimed ,COMMA raped ,COMMA or tortured is one too many .PERIOD The fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago ?QUESTIONMARK Is good news .PERIOD 
But let's look at the good news again .PERIOD 
But then is northern ireland ,COMMA a unique example ,COMMA or does this kind of explanation only hold more ,COMMA generally in democratic and developed countries .PERIOD 
A final example ,COMMA kosovo .PERIOD 
Central among them ,COMMA are three .PERIOD 
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level ,COMMA well-resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region ,COMMA more generally .PERIOD And the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint ,COMMA explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since <NUM> .PERIOD 
A final thought ending .PERIOD Civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work .PERIOD 
And at that young age <NUM> years old ,COMMA benki became the paje of his community .PERIOD 
He went <NUM> miles on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny ,COMMA little corner .PERIOD 
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on .PERIOD 
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest .PERIOD 
Together ,COMMA he's led the reforestation of over <NUM> percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers .PERIOD 
Why are you putting yourself at risk ?QUESTIONMARK 
So when i think of that ,COMMA i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA i wonder how they will answer .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside .PERIOD 
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results .PERIOD We've always gotten .PERIOD 
We have to change .PERIOD 
It's imperative to me ,COMMA when i look around the world that we need to change ourselves .PERIOD 
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an ngo .PERIOD She started her career as university professor teaching english literature .PERIOD 
They take care of 20000-odd people today in over <NUM> villages ,COMMA around karnataka .PERIOD 
They've pioneered a different approach to villages .PERIOD 
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case ,COMMA they bring theater troupes ,COMMA songs ,COMMA music dance .PERIOD 
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD 
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history .PERIOD 
They looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed what was on the inside .PERIOD 
They've gone away from what they did before ,COMMA and they've gone to something they didn't know .PERIOD 
He went around once he went around twice .PERIOD He went around ,COMMA thrice .PERIOD 
And so when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world .PERIOD 
Perhaps he was a jain monk like bahubali over here .PERIOD The gomateshwara bahubali ,COMMA whose image is not far from mysore .PERIOD 
Alexander asked :COLON what ?QUESTIONMARK Are you doing .PERIOD 
And they both laughed .PERIOD 
What should you not be .PERIOD 
You should not be sisyphus ,COMMA who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD 
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say ,COMMA i was here first .PERIOD 
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist .PERIOD 
But they were not two characters on two different adventures .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD 
You go again and again and again .PERIOD 
Two :COLON different mythologies .PERIOD Two different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD 
And i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero .PERIOD 
Who knows .PERIOD 
Standard business model ,COMMA vision ,COMMA mission ,COMMA values ,COMMA processes .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA this is what india is today .PERIOD The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD 
I have personally experienced it .PERIOD I'm trained as a medical doctor .PERIOD 
And he knew very intuitively ,COMMA that best practices developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india .PERIOD 
You can't measure it .PERIOD You can't manage it .PERIOD 
After a leader completes his training ,COMMA and is about to take over the store ,COMMA we blindfold him .PERIOD We surround him with the stakeholders .PERIOD The customer his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss .PERIOD 
That sensitivity is what we need once .PERIOD This belief enters .PERIOD Behavior will happen .PERIOD Business will happen .PERIOD 
But that was interesting in itself .PERIOD This is companies like vonage .PERIOD 
The little box has your phone number .PERIOD 
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out skype for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad .PERIOD 
They don't want to pay the international fees .PERIOD So they're like ,COMMA timmy is that you .PERIOD 
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone ,COMMA and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company a nickel .PERIOD 
And when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network .PERIOD 
You're thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA how often am i in a hotspot .PERIOD 
Because they give you a regular wireless router ,COMMA that works with the phone for your house .PERIOD 
They don't have that kind of money .PERIOD Instead they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box .PERIOD They're like a stealth tower installation program .PERIOD 
Now i'm leaving the house .PERIOD Dp .PERIOD I'm going for a walk -- do you mind .PERIOD 
I don't know why my wife says ,COMMA i never listen to her .PERIOD I don't get that .PERIOD 
I have two cellphones .PERIOD So this going to be very odd .PERIOD If it works .PERIOD 
Excuse me ,COMMA one second .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA we've made the point .PERIOD 
The beauty of that is you never miss a call .PERIOD 
Google bought it .PERIOD And they've been working on it for a year .PERIOD 
I actually got a photograph of the verizon employee ,COMMA right there .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA it comes .PERIOD 
And it's already written down -- so like if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things .PERIOD Uh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK Uh huh ?QUESTIONMARK Uh ,COMMA huh .PERIOD 
Shortly i'll tell you why i was in milan .PERIOD 
That's cute .PERIOD I do have an email address .PERIOD You can just ask me .PERIOD 
It's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message :COLON nobody over <NUM> knows how to do that .PERIOD 
So i'm going to teach you something even better .PERIOD 
They put this teeny-weeny little ad ,COMMA about <NUM> characters long .PERIOD 
Because there is one .PERIOD 
As you can imagine ,COMMA it's college kids and old people .PERIOD 
When i call to leave you a message ,COMMA i get <NUM> seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on ambien .PERIOD 
So now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that .PERIOD 
The reason i think that is that on the first day i tried one of these services .PERIOD I got two voicemail messages .PERIOD One was from a guy named michael stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe ,COMMA and it was misspelled .PERIOD 
I love my job .PERIOD 
I'm not kidding .PERIOD You ,COMMA the message said ,COMMA was walking along ,COMMA the street and sky was blue and emergency .PERIOD 
And lastly ,COMMA i just have to talk about this one .PERIOD 
Phone ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD 
What are you doing .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA even so he was turned down by verizon and others .PERIOD 
It's got bad things and good things .PERIOD Lets all acknowledge that right now .PERIOD 
It's absurd .PERIOD We have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD We have running water .PERIOD 
You type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation .PERIOD 
I know it's insane right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It will immediately play you that song ,COMMA or that band .PERIOD 
If you like that one or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down .PERIOD Over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs .PERIOD 
It proposes .PERIOD A restaurant .PERIOD 
And now the end is near .PERIOD 
I want an iphone .PERIOD 
Who cares if it's at&ampt .PERIOD 
Because the breast has become are very political organ .PERIOD 
I will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth .PERIOD 
But first ,COMMA my disclosures .PERIOD 
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .PERIOD 
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature ,COMMA and issued a guideline recommending against screening .PERIOD Mammograms in women in their 40s .PERIOD 
Screening ,COMMA the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer .PERIOD 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge ,COMMA bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .PERIOD 
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement ,COMMA but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .PERIOD 
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells .PERIOD And this is the key difference from mammography .PERIOD 
Our big break came in <NUM> .PERIOD 
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors .PERIOD We used these images to submit a grant to the susan g .PERIOD Komen foundation .PERIOD 
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study <NUM> women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi .PERIOD 
Here's an example from that screening study .PERIOD 
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome ,COMMA finding .PERIOD 
But i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image .PERIOD 
After the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript ,COMMA because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .PERIOD 
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it ,COMMA many years later and most women .PERIOD Thankfully ,COMMA survive .PERIOD 
So i worked with white noise .PERIOD 
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound .PERIOD 
But it is just physiology .PERIOD It's just in your brain .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA i create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from ,COMMA and roll ,COMMA at home ,COMMA or at work ,COMMA towards aggressive noise ,COMMA and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .PERIOD 
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach ,COMMA i designed k .PERIOD 
I'm just a designer ,COMMA so i need them .PERIOD 
And the irony for me was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i didn't do that .PERIOD For the sake of science ,COMMA progress .PERIOD 
I just do that to make money .PERIOD 
So we took too many of them .PERIOD 
This :COLON one is an antibiotic .PERIOD 
But in this case ,COMMA it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient .PERIOD 
So the idea is all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules ,COMMA for sure .PERIOD 
You have to know or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor ,COMMA one .PERIOD 
So while i'm talking to you ,COMMA the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas .PERIOD Sorry for that .PERIOD 
So your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys give their own invisible reality .PERIOD And this one is very toxic .PERIOD 
This one is kind of the same approach ,COMMA because i include in a product like andrea ,COMMA some plants .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm ,COMMA for fishes ,COMMA and green .PERIOD 
So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food .PERIOD 
After it goes back into the fish tank .PERIOD 
Now we can eat local food .PERIOD 
See like this one .PERIOD 
You can see it there .PERIOD 
We're the new technologists .PERIOD 
I think about world war ii -- some of our great technologists .PERIOD Then ,COMMA some of our great physicists ,COMMA studying nuclear fission and fusion -- just nuclear stuff .PERIOD 
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology .PERIOD 
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good .PERIOD 
So to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question -- something i'm sure everybody here has an opinion about iphone versus android .PERIOD 
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .PERIOD 
In math ,COMMA we know the objective facts .PERIOD 
It's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form .PERIOD 
Then you would know what was really just ,COMMA and what wasn't .PERIOD 
If you think that way you have a platonist moral framework .PERIOD 
He thought it was impractical .PERIOD 
It's just a matter of the consequences .PERIOD 
Kant was very good on this point ,COMMA and he said it a little better than i'll say it .PERIOD 
What should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK What's the answer .PERIOD 
There's not a formula .PERIOD 
And don't just find another technologist friend ,COMMA find somebody different than you .PERIOD 
We care what happens in that opera .PERIOD 
In the early '80s ,COMMA some would say .PERIOD 
The gang had no way to make money .PERIOD 
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart ,COMMA and decided he wanted to get a sociology phd .PERIOD Came to the university of chicago .PERIOD 
And in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak .PERIOD 
So he showed up at the university of chicago .PERIOD 
There was a lot of gunfire .PERIOD There were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members .PERIOD 
And you and i ,COMMA probably faced with the situation ,COMMA would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead .PERIOD 
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald's is its franchisees .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK So you might be surprised .PERIOD 
We found in our gang -- and admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation ;SEMICOLON this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD But there were costs .PERIOD 
That makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .PERIOD 
That the young people controlled the gang -- that ,COMMA as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang .PERIOD 
So what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time -- the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s -- became very ,COMMA very wealthy .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA he would say to his friends .PERIOD Hey ,COMMA look at all the money i got in the gang .PERIOD 
Often our theories fail quite miserably .PERIOD When we go to the data .PERIOD 
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics ,COMMA called a compensating differential .PERIOD 
It's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
So in the words of one of the members of the gang ,COMMA i think ,COMMA makes this clear .PERIOD 
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely .PERIOD 
If you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit .PERIOD 
And i thought about it ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA ceos often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses ,COMMA even when companies are losing a lot of money .PERIOD 
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD 
You can see the skydiver with the red suit .PERIOD He's in a stand-up position .PERIOD 
This is a jump .PERIOD I did in rio de janeiro .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk ,COMMA and from the jungfrau .PERIOD Three .PERIOD Very famous mountains in switzerland .PERIOD 
June :COLON cohen :COLON i have some questions .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA but people are trying :COLON are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it .PERIOD 
It's a dream .PERIOD It's a dream .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD 
And is that how you usually fly .PERIOD 
Do people come to you with projects and say ,COMMA we want you to do this .PERIOD 
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting .PERIOD 
The show was ,COMMA in a sense about that .PERIOD 
I also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog .PERIOD Some haze .PERIOD 
And what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space .PERIOD 
What does it matter .PERIOD 
It makes a difference .PERIOD Whether you say i'm a part of this city .PERIOD 
It's quite simple and fundamental .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA doesn't really tell you what you're looking at .PERIOD 
Or is that a three-hour hike ?QUESTIONMARK Or is that a whole day ?QUESTIONMARK I'm looking at .PERIOD 
If you have a waterfall in there ,COMMA right out there at the horizon ,COMMA you look at the waterfall .PERIOD And you go ,COMMA oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK The water is falling .PERIOD Really ,COMMA slowly .PERIOD 
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD 
So art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now .PERIOD 
What i really enjoyed about this project ,COMMA is reviving these people's words .PERIOD 
So what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by nathalia crane .PERIOD 
The next poem is ,COMMA if no one ever marries me .PERIOD 
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children .PERIOD 
Just bring it down a little .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius ,COMMA frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD 
And quite often we sit in a design meeting ,COMMA and we discover that there is this great idea .PERIOD 
But for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD 
And they chose this mascot ,COMMA because the theme of the expo is better city ,COMMA better life .PERIOD 
But then we looked at recent urban development ,COMMA and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA all bikes ,COMMA no cars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if you come to the expo ,COMMA go straight to the danish pavilion ,COMMA get a danish bike and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions .PERIOD 
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid .PERIOD 
So the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house .PERIOD 
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic ,COMMA naturally ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image .PERIOD 
It has no water ;SEMICOLON it has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD 
They accumulate ,COMMA the solar energy .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off .PERIOD 
I'm just going to list some of them .PERIOD 
Where should we start on solving these problems .PERIOD 
To climate change that would be like kyoto .PERIOD 
I'd love to go into and get you to think about this process ,COMMA and that's actually what we did .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA you have to ask yourself .PERIOD Why on earth was such a list never done before .PERIOD 
Nobody wants to do this .PERIOD 
We'd like to know these things .PERIOD 
Three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would be the price .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA i'm very happy you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question .PERIOD 
This offends a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say i shouldn't come back either .PERIOD 
And i'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious .PERIOD 
The reason why they came up with saying that kyoto -- or doing something more than kyoto -- is a bad deal ,COMMA is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD 
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it .PERIOD 
There are many problems out there in the world .PERIOD 
And what i want to make sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones .PERIOD 
The ones where we can do a lot of good ,COMMA rather than a little good .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that .PERIOD 
We have ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the day after tomorrow -- it looks great right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good .PERIOD 
But the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way .PERIOD Don't we .PERIOD 
So we actually invited <NUM> young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD 
My studio in bali was only <NUM> minutes away from a monkey forest .PERIOD And monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals .PERIOD 
The serif is not really in place .PERIOD 
And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant what to do ,COMMA but the elephant really has his own ideas .PERIOD 
And from that point of view ,COMMA we turned it into a lovely project .PERIOD 
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .PERIOD 
And then we're ready to add the living organism .PERIOD 
And actually ,COMMA in hot weather ,COMMA i can just grow it outside .PERIOD 
But i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Suzanne .PERIOD Lee .PERIOD 
I made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this .PERIOD 
How do the taliban in your area ?QUESTIONMARK Get people to join them .PERIOD 
Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .PERIOD 
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .PERIOD 
Soc :COLON i ,COMMA in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children .PERIOD And i think it's a five-step process .PERIOD 
These .PERIOD Children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio ,COMMA reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them .PERIOD 
Effectively ,COMMA the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children .PERIOD 
He blew himself up ,COMMA killing six .PERIOD 
Two years ago here at ted ,COMMA i reported that we had discovered at saturn ,COMMA with the cassini spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon enceladus seen here .PERIOD 
While they're not amino acids ,COMMA we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen cyanide .PERIOD And formaldehyde .PERIOD 
So we are very encouraged by these results .PERIOD 
And this is quite an extraordinary idea ,COMMA but it is reality today .PERIOD 
This was created by an architectural firm called shiro .PERIOD 
And you can actually walk into it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD 
There's a lower chance of rejection .PERIOD 
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD 
I don't think that will happen soon .PERIOD 
We're now instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the internet .PERIOD 
And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies .PERIOD 
So one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is dr .PERIOD Anthony atala :COLON and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders ,COMMA valves ,COMMA kidneys .PERIOD 
We like different things .PERIOD 
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than <NUM> years .PERIOD And so it's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD What does it mean .PERIOD 
And i would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say obama ,COMMA he's our brother .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD It was the humiliation ,COMMA and the embarrassment of it all .PERIOD 
And i say ,COMMA 'look at me ,COMMA you are not dead .PERIOD 
And in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear ,COMMA i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary .PERIOD 
It was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech .PERIOD 
And i concluded ,COMMA after researching every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels ,COMMA different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy .PERIOD 
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that .PERIOD But fundamentally ,COMMA the process requires a tremendous amount of energy .PERIOD 
So i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .PERIOD 
Traditionally ,COMMA concentrators look like this .PERIOD 
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces because you lose about <NUM> percent with each bounce .PERIOD But this allowed us to collect light from a plus ,COMMA or minus <NUM> degree angle .PERIOD 
So once you have mobility now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units ,COMMA as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units .PERIOD So this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production ,COMMA where all the other engines didn't benefit .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way .PERIOD Because it was practical -- weight no longer mattered for our application ,COMMA the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered .PERIOD Because you were moving around .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA someone came up with a very clever idea to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder .PERIOD What about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth .PERIOD 
We measured each one ,COMMA we readjusted the model to what we measured .PERIOD And then we led that to the current prototype .PERIOD 
It led to a very compact ,COMMA inexpensive engine .PERIOD And this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD 
So an example of that is here's the map of the united states .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA look at africa .PERIOD 
There's <NUM> watts of light ,COMMA pouring on the stage .PERIOD One horsepower is <NUM> watts at full power .PERIOD 
But everywhere around us ,COMMA we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap .PERIOD 
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun .PERIOD 
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .PERIOD 
And this is the tower from below .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane ;SEMICOLON you would take on vacation .PERIOD 
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .PERIOD 
What i am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity .PERIOD 
So i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .PERIOD 
And that was a good thing to help ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cause .PERIOD 
But then he came back and things happened ,COMMA and i decided i really hated my writing ,COMMA that it was awful ,COMMA awful ,COMMA purple prose .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA tibor really started the studio called m&ampco .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA to be able to talk about content ,COMMA to break apart what you normally expect ,COMMA to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity in your work ,COMMA was really important to us .PERIOD 
I don't really -- i mean ,COMMA i could tell you that i didn't understand .PERIOD I'm not proud of it ,COMMA but i didn't understand .PERIOD Let's say ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the talks at this conference .PERIOD 
So i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .PERIOD 
And so i was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD 
I work for the new yorker ,COMMA and i do covers and <NUM>/<NUM> happened .PERIOD And it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .PERIOD 
We hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover .PERIOD And we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .PERIOD 
And david remnick ,COMMA who was really wonderful about it ,COMMA had one problem ,COMMA he didn't like al zheimers because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer's .PERIOD 
And he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug .PERIOD 
So what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing .PERIOD And i think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD 
I happen to know it for a fact .PERIOD 
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs .PERIOD But stalin was a paranoid man .PERIOD Even more than my father .PERIOD 
Which i think i made up ,COMMA which is a good thing .PERIOD 
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper .PERIOD And there was the picture of the man on the newspaper ,COMMA and he was dead .PERIOD 
And i really spend a lot of time wondering ,COMMA how much truth do we tell .PERIOD 
How do we know when we are ourselves .PERIOD 
A quote ,COMMA by bertrand russell all the labor of all the ages ,COMMA all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD 
And i would like to run it for them .PERIOD 
And it says ,COMMA ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a bach ,COMMA cantata ?QUESTIONMARK Which i once thought meant i've had it .PERIOD I can't take it anymore .PERIOD Give me a break ,COMMA but i was wrong .PERIOD 
I thought that things would be pretty fun ,COMMA and there would be more things to play with .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives .PERIOD But we often miss the very subtle changes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars ,COMMA with motors ,COMMA with neurons .PERIOD 
We're concerned in the national security community .PERIOD And of course ,COMMA in the biology community and the public health community .PERIOD 
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .PERIOD 
So what have people been doing with this money ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's everybody run around and play your role .PERIOD 
Most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful -- i'll get into that -- of available vaccines ,COMMA and any other treatments and masks .PERIOD And anything that's been stockpiled .PERIOD 
And you'll have massive competition .PERIOD 
During the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help .PERIOD 
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask ,COMMA and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD Bingo ,COMMA they got sars .PERIOD 
The pandemic circulated three times in <NUM> months in the absence of commercial air travel .PERIOD 
This was based on european and north american data .PERIOD 
And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of <NUM> to <NUM> million people before we had commercial air travel .PERIOD 
So are we ready .PERIOD 
If you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be .PERIOD 
But really do you really have a place to stockpile <NUM> months worth of food ?QUESTIONMARK Twenty-four months worth of food .PERIOD 
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i hope i've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders and your national leaders ,COMMA why haven't you solved these problems .PERIOD 
But can you sustain your company that way .PERIOD 
The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission .PERIOD 
The mechanism isn't clear .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA we don't really know for sure .PERIOD 
Audience member :COLON one of the things i've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer ,COMMA you <NUM> percent better chance of survival .PERIOD 
And so far in the h5n1 cases in people .PERIOD Similarly .PERIOD Bacterial infection has not been an issue at all .PERIOD 
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells don't recognize it either .PERIOD 
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although i'm known to make my dreams come true .PERIOD 
One :COLON two :COLON three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD 
And i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him ,COMMA well ,COMMA what do you think .PERIOD 
For the move to be professional ,COMMA it has to be less than one second .PERIOD And it has to be perfect .PERIOD 
But in america you have to explain what are clubs .PERIOD 
They have to be precisely lathed .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA here i was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD 
The clubs were escaping me at each throw .PERIOD 
So i proudly showed him my clubs .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA philippe ,COMMA you have been had .PERIOD 
They are impossible to juggle .PERIOD 
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers ,COMMA and i gather them together in some kind of ropey path .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA within a few days ,COMMA i'm able to do one crossing .PERIOD 
If not ,COMMA i will never do that first step .PERIOD 
It's a straight line ,COMMA which sags ,COMMA which sways ,COMMA which vibrates ,COMMA which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready ?QUESTIONMARK To explode .PERIOD Ready to swallow me .PERIOD 
An inner howl assails me .PERIOD The wild longing to flee .PERIOD 
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records .PERIOD 
And something happened .PERIOD 
He didn't know the true story .PERIOD 
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity they foster and their quiet ,COMMA beauty .PERIOD 
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy .PERIOD 
These are not epiphyte roots .PERIOD These are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD 
We know it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know the answers to how much .PERIOD And by what processes ,COMMA carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass ,COMMA and moving on through the ecosystem .PERIOD 
They ended up making a cd ,COMMA which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD 
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work .PERIOD 
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses .PERIOD 
We gave talks once a month ,COMMA and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping .PERIOD 
As many of you are aware ,COMMA the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one .PERIOD 
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward ,COMMA to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community .PERIOD 
When i look into my heart ,COMMA i see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts .PERIOD There are trees in your hearts .PERIOD 
It was taken <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
There is a problem with scuba though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go .PERIOD And it turns out that depth is about <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
And there's a phenomenon called henry's law that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to .PERIOD 
You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater .PERIOD Not a good thing to happen underwater .PERIOD 
This picture was taken <NUM> feet ,COMMA deep ,COMMA catching new species of fish .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD 
Alright ,COMMA closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ?QUESTIONMARK And why is it better .PERIOD 
Well there are three main advantages to a rebreather .PERIOD 
So we need another gas ,COMMA something to dilute the oxygen with .PERIOD 
But if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics .PERIOD The third system of a rebreather .PERIOD 
And yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking .PERIOD 
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people .PERIOD Make them out to be .PERIOD 
There's a cover story .PERIOD All about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD 
The last article is an article :COLON entitled no new frontiers .PERIOD 
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD 
And then eventually ,COMMA i got around to looking in my bucket .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this one's pretty cool .PERIOD 
So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known .PERIOD 
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently ,COMMA not .PERIOD 
At the beginning ,COMMA i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs .PERIOD 
The reason i show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals .PERIOD 
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD I call it perpetuation :COLON the survival of the species and survival of ourselves because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD 
You have to balance those two goals .PERIOD 
But here's what really perplexed me .PERIOD 
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at .PERIOD The brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ecg or a chest x-ray to look at the heart .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .PERIOD 
And then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it ,COMMA instead of in brain research ,COMMA towards diagnosing brain disorders .PERIOD In children .PERIOD 
And another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant .PERIOD Allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD 
When we used this groundbreaking eeg technology ,COMMA to actually look at justin's brain ,COMMA the results were startling .PERIOD 
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience ,COMMA one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects ,COMMA non-invasively ,COMMA and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .PERIOD 
It's something like life that once you get in it ,COMMA you can't get out .PERIOD 
There are two clips i want to show you .PERIOD The first one is a kind of hodgepodge ,COMMA its just three little moments .PERIOD Four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight .PERIOD 
It was built .PERIOD Entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding ,COMMA people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA those are the two clips i'm going to show .PERIOD 
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station ,COMMA it was so consistent with his life .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
Man .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD It is .PERIOD The national image of bangladesh .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA he never saw this .PERIOD 
And this is the largest project he has got in here ,COMMA the poorest country in the world .PERIOD 
It's a story of nations ,COMMA of ideologies ,COMMA of territories ,COMMA and of conflicts among them .PERIOD 
Here .PERIOD 
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics .PERIOD 
Whether we're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy .PERIOD We are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust .PERIOD 
Well what about <NUM>^<NUM> .PERIOD 
That line would have to be <NUM> million miles above this stage .PERIOD 
I think this is what david deutsch meant in <NUM> ,COMMA when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying ,COMMA he had two principles he'd like to share for living .PERIOD And he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD 
We've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .PERIOD 
And over those long distances ,COMMA its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD 
But this is a simple signal .PERIOD And tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD 
This is a very good year .PERIOD 
<NUM> is the 400th anniversary of galileo's first use of the telescope ,COMMA darwin's 200th birthday ,COMMA the 150th anniversary of the publication of on the origin of species ,COMMA the 50th anniversary of seti ,COMMA as a science ,COMMA the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit .PERIOD And of course ,COMMA the 25th anniversary of ted .PERIOD 
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust ,COMMA to build an environment where raw data could be stored ,COMMA and where it could be accessed and manipulated ,COMMA where new algorithms could be developed ,COMMA and old algorithms made more efficient .PERIOD 
I'm sorry ,COMMA seth godin ,COMMA but over the millennia we've seen where tribalism leads .PERIOD 
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ,COMMA ages .PERIOD 
Ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow ,COMMA season after season for thousands of years .PERIOD 
From this ,COMMA we can detect an extraordinary number of things .PERIOD 
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics .PERIOD 
They have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about <NUM> degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise ,COMMA the key gases inside it will dissipate .PERIOD 
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map .PERIOD And they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended .PERIOD 
It is a voice of experience .PERIOD 
It is a voice .PERIOD We should heed .PERIOD 
This thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame ,COMMA that four colleagues .PERIOD And i wrote and have posted for free at oilendgamecom -- about <NUM> downloads so far .PERIOD 
So when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things .PERIOD 
And serious competition from europe from korea .PERIOD And next is china ,COMMA which will soon be a major net exporter of cars .PERIOD 
The point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient .PERIOD 
The question is ,COMMA who will make them .PERIOD 
It's financeable in the private capital market .PERIOD 
And in the upper left ,COMMA a pioneering effort ,COMMA <NUM> years ago by gm -- <NUM> miles a gallon without even using a hybrid ,COMMA in a four-seater .PERIOD 
In the airplane business ,COMMA it's again a similar story where the first <NUM> percent fuel saving is free .PERIOD As boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner .PERIOD 
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety .PERIOD 
The golf was totaled .PERIOD 
Because these materials could actually absorb six to <NUM> times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly .PERIOD 
This expands choice rapidly in the market ,COMMA and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD 
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient ,COMMA reliable ,COMMA warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get .PERIOD 
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers they weren't going to get otherwise .PERIOD Because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car .PERIOD 
It turns out that if say african-american and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities .PERIOD 
Just turn it over to the private sector ,COMMA and we have an internet .PERIOD 
Ours is on the demand side .PERIOD 
I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years or so ,COMMA in the computer game industry having ideas that people didn't think they could sell .PERIOD 
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states ,COMMA after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another <NUM> children ,COMMA drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research ,COMMA and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics ,COMMA for designing computer-based products -- and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA any kind of products -- for little girls ,COMMA ages eight to <NUM> .PERIOD 
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about .PERIOD 
Girl :COLON <NUM> :COLON this is my pretend [unclear] .PERIOD One .PERIOD 
This is the second day in rockett's life .PERIOD 
I wanted to show you the ways ,COMMA innocuous as they seem ,COMMA in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility ,COMMA and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .PERIOD 
He went through europe ,COMMA through world war ii ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .PERIOD 
So he finally found an art dealer .PERIOD A dutch art dealer named han van meegeren who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
He had a lesser charge of forgery ,COMMA got a year sentence and died .PERIOD A hero to the dutch people .PERIOD 
Many sociologists like veblen .PERIOD And wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs .PERIOD Because we're focused on status .PERIOD 
Would you eat this .PERIOD 
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human .PERIOD 
It's simple ,COMMA you tell them they're from mcdonald's .PERIOD 
It's very simple ,COMMA pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD 
It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .PERIOD 
That drops the value of it ,COMMA suggesting that that's one reason why we like it .PERIOD 
Rather it's because i want something that has a specific history .PERIOD 
Who here likes the work of jackson pollock .PERIOD 
And the washington post reporter :COLON gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment .PERIOD 
So he got joshua bell ,COMMA to take his million dollar violin down to a washington dc .PERIOD Subway station ,COMMA and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .PERIOD 
He actually made <NUM> dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it .PERIOD 
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD 
One lovely experiment was done by kurt gray .PERIOD And dan wegner .PERIOD 
And what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims ,COMMA unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims ,COMMA isn't a kind of nasty carping activity ;SEMICOLON it's socially useful .PERIOD But it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD 
She it turns out ,COMMA has a non-accredited correspondence course .PERIOD Phd .PERIOD 
A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer .PERIOD 
So i'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the uk .PERIOD News media ,COMMA over the past decade .PERIOD 
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies ,COMMA comparing one kind of placebo against another .PERIOD 
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body .PERIOD But because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD 
But that's not enough .PERIOD 
What i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices .PERIOD But slightly more sophisticated versions of them in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions .PERIOD 
And it's a foregone conclusion ,COMMA if you give a drug at that high a dose ,COMMA that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD 
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone .PERIOD So you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD 
This is a drug called reboxetine .PERIOD 
Around ,COMMA half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld .PERIOD But it goes way beyond that .PERIOD 
But the companies withheld that data from them ,COMMA and so did the european medicines agency for three years .PERIOD 
The infectious diseases ,COMMA cochrane group ,COMMA which are ,COMMA based in italy ,COMMA has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not .PERIOD And they've not been able to get that information .PERIOD 
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I saw people struggling to get by ,COMMA not knowing what was what and what was next .PERIOD

My own epiphany as a conservationist came in <NUM> ,COMMA while a harvard ,COMMA graduate student ,COMMA searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants ,COMMA that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species ,COMMA and one species i discovered ,COMMA metallic gold .PERIOD 
And the final letter is ,COMMA o ,COMMA for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing .PERIOD 
That's in the united states .PERIOD 
But what excites me is that ,COMMA since i first put forward this particular idea in that form ,COMMA science has advanced .PERIOD 
I wish you would help them .PERIOD 
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .PERIOD 
The idea that in that room at that moment ,COMMA everyone regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion ,COMMA comes together .PERIOD 
Let's start with technology .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA let's start with theater .PERIOD 
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me ,COMMA they hadn't seen the kids that attentive .PERIOD 
Zero does not speak .PERIOD Is neither man nor woman .PERIOD 
And that usually ,COMMA if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .PERIOD 
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD 
It's a human and technological revolution .PERIOD 
And well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD 
And what i was curious about -- because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit so nothing would be wasted -- and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case .PERIOD 
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket ,COMMA there's gelatin to make it look good .PERIOD 
Fine ,COMMA bone china -- this is a real classic .PERIOD 
I was not planning on showing you any meat ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are .PERIOD 
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings .PERIOD So the collagen is as well .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve because want his product to be associated with pigs .PERIOD 
Well it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .PERIOD 
This is a picture of maurice druon ,COMMA the honorary perpetual secretary of l'academie francaise .PERIOD The french academy .PERIOD 
We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon ,COMMA of the historical change in languages ,COMMA in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages .PERIOD 
The problem is ,COMMA which verbs go in which constructions .PERIOD 
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there .PERIOD Sam ,COMMA devoured the pizza .PERIOD You can't just say ,COMMA sam devoured .PERIOD 
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type ,COMMA each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language .PERIOD 
Or the meeting went from three to four ,COMMA in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line .PERIOD 
Or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose's head ,COMMA engaged in a tug of a war .PERIOD 
And i'll start out with a puzzle :COLON the puzzle of indirect speech acts .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities ,COMMA locutions like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD 
In that case the consequences are rather severe .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe .PERIOD If the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free .PERIOD 
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe .PERIOD And therefore ,COMMA you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .PERIOD 
Because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the western grebe you haven't lived until you've seen .PERIOD These guys do their courtship dance .PERIOD 
What they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we already do biomimicry .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what happens is ,COMMA mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so i picked up some shells on the beach ,COMMA and i asked them ,COMMA what is scaling ?QUESTIONMARK What's inside your pipes .PERIOD 
And they didn't know that .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's a silo ,COMMA people in silos .PERIOD They didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD So ,COMMA one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK What stops the scaling .PERIOD 
How do we redesign the world that we make ,COMMA the human-made world .PERIOD

That's the twelfth one .PERIOD 
And i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA here was a girl who had never lived in peace time ,COMMA who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice .PERIOD 
My first business was a dressmaking business i started under the taliban .PERIOD 
The :COLON imf official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro .PERIOD 
And in many places ,COMMA they're there .PERIOD 
Because -- and i say this as somebody who worked in finance -- <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA at least ,COMMA has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .PERIOD 
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA employment ,COMMA child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality ,COMMA literacy and much much more .PERIOD 
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one .PERIOD 
The women in my family are not exceptions .PERIOD 
The women in this room and watching in la .PERIOD 
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .PERIOD 
Once upon a time in 19th century ,COMMA germany ,COMMA there was the book .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling .PERIOD 
His name was lothar .PERIOD Lothar meggendorfer .PERIOD 
This :COLON man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .PERIOD 
Whether storytellers realized it or not ,COMMA they were channeling meggendorfer's spirit .PERIOD When they moved opera to vaudville ,COMMA radio news to radio theater ,COMMA film to film in motion to film in sound color ,COMMA 3d on vhs and on dvd .PERIOD 
And i really want to build green ,COMMA but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles ,COMMA people long on moral authority and short on data .PERIOD Telling me how to do these kinds of things .PERIOD 
Wipe it up .PERIOD Throw it away .PERIOD 
Unless i use a front-loading ,COMMA high-efficiency washing machine .PERIOD And then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD 
So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize .PERIOD 
We wanted to know how much better we could do .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA pvc is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose .PERIOD 
When it comes time to sheetrock ,COMMA if you use ecorock ,COMMA it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock .PERIOD 
If you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy .PERIOD 
So now we add in the final construction energy ,COMMA we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this .PERIOD 
Now i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient .PERIOD And in that case it would take me more about <NUM> years to break even .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what does this mean .PERIOD 
You might want to leave now .PERIOD 
So i did .PERIOD 
And i'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies ,COMMA species like rats and cockroaches ,COMMA and crows .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD 
We're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD 
And i'll give you an example of that .PERIOD 
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot ,COMMA out of pieces of wood .PERIOD 
They messed up and left ,COMMA just a stick of wire in there .PERIOD 
So what's significant about ?QUESTIONMARK This isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD 
And as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble .PERIOD And we're starting to see it with them .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back ,COMMA and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins .PERIOD That's there .PERIOD 
The main thing ,COMMA the main point of all this ,COMMA for me ,COMMA is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD 
So my grandfather told me ,COMMA when i was a little girl ,COMMA if you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you .PERIOD 
Anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel ,COMMA that old ,COMMA radio ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in watergate ,COMMA moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing ;SEMICOLON combination of things .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit .PERIOD 
Just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in .PERIOD And they're just about to close the pneumatic doors .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA here's huck ,COMMA he's an illiterate kid .PERIOD He's had no schooling .PERIOD But there's something in him .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference ,COMMA like this ,COMMA i like to inspire people .PERIOD 
And i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though i've outlived most of them .PERIOD

He says ,COMMA 'she won't breathe' i knew immediately that she was dead .PERIOD 
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead .PERIOD So i went in and i put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing ,COMMA nothing coming out of her mouth .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'we can't .PERIOD We can't let nobody find out about this' he say ,COMMA 'you've got to help me' i agree .PERIOD I agree .PERIOD 
And so i went to both -- two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the los angeles riot .PERIOD And this next piece is from that .PERIOD 
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD I was at that trial .PERIOD 
So what she's questioning here ;SEMICOLON she's taking a chance ,COMMA and questioning what justice is in society .PERIOD 
We didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no gr ,COMMA no welfare .PERIOD Anything ,COMMA many african-americans ,COMMA who never work ,COMMA got minimum amount of money to survive .PERIOD 
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house .PERIOD 
And i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way .PERIOD 
But after the riot ,COMMA it's too much difference .PERIOD 
The other reason that i don't wear shoes is just in case .PERIOD I really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD 
I was in a doctor's office .PERIOD Last cat scan ,COMMA and there was a reader's digest ,COMMA october <NUM> .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like 'she's just talking .PERIOD She's just being nice to you .PERIOD She's not going to do that' .PERIOD And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here and interview me .PERIOD And she went and looked you up on the internet .PERIOD

I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads ,COMMA with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing hush little baby ,COMMA don't say a word .PERIOD 
Wow .PERIOD 
Now most media companies -- television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA publishing ,COMMA games ,COMMA you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences .PERIOD 
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD 
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media .PERIOD That's actually quite surprising .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD 
This is far too simplistic .PERIOD 
So you may be asking ,COMMA well ,COMMA why is it important that i know what entertains people .PERIOD 
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated .PERIOD

And lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away .PERIOD 
It was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD 
This is the 1950s .PERIOD 
I have an answer for you .PERIOD I have two answers .PERIOD 
So now you have an evolutionary excuse .PERIOD 
Alrighty ,COMMA there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD

But after having lost a beloved teacher in <NUM> and a good friend last year to suicide and sitting last year at tedactive ,COMMA i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life ,COMMA need more resources and need our help .PERIOD

It's called tidying up art .PERIOD And it's ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book .PERIOD

And we can see here very clearly .PERIOD It's a confusion of color .PERIOD

You can see now ,COMMA that's a good example :COLON even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .PERIOD 
That's a picture by keith haring .PERIOD 
In the end ,COMMA one has a list with which one then can arrange .PERIOD 
Tidying up ,COMMA rene magritte -- this is really fun .PERIOD

Even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each tedtalk individually .PERIOD 
I don't know any tedtalk that contains this .PERIOD 
I had started out with a thousand tedtalks ,COMMA and i had <NUM> ,COMMA six-word summaries for those .PERIOD 
So i thought ,COMMA i probably have to take this one step further here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what i did .PERIOD 
So he's discovering the garden .PERIOD 
His face ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is fully ai-driven .PERIOD 
Now we need to have a bit more engagement .PERIOD And again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body .PERIOD 
You stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone .PERIOD 
And we're going to help him with this .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
But this is going to be an introduction .PERIOD And this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use .PERIOD 
We're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo .PERIOD 
He's just moved house ;SEMICOLON he's got no friends .PERIOD 
They're always getting stressed .PERIOD 
Milo :COLON i just really miss my old house .PERIOD That's all .PERIOD 
But for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with where i am no longer restrained by the finger ,COMMA i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book .PERIOD 
Each of you possesses the most powerful ,COMMA dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .PERIOD 
I'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind .PERIOD And they can attempt to do the same to you .PERIOD Without either of you having to perform surgery .PERIOD

There ,COMMA are three reasons why .PERIOD This is the case .PERIOD 
When you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids .PERIOD

Join the movement .PERIOD 
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change .PERIOD And here's yet another new york times article just like every other darn one you've seen .PERIOD 
And we've accomplished close to zip .PERIOD 
And there are times you might like to do something quick .PERIOD 
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally .PERIOD 
And the answer seems to be yes .PERIOD 
It just sunk below the surface .PERIOD We weren't allowed to speak about it .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away .PERIOD 
But let's say ,COMMA you have sunlight hitting some particle ,COMMA and it's unevenly heated .PERIOD 
So the side facing the sun is warmer :COLON the side away ,COMMA cooler .PERIOD 
And so you see a net force away from the sun .PERIOD 
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .PERIOD 
We need a broader debate .PERIOD 
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering .PERIOD We do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions .PERIOD 
But i have a lot of reservations .PERIOD 
And it's time to begin thinking about it ,COMMA even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site .PERIOD 
And i wanted to see the center with my own eyes .PERIOD But what i came away with is a photograph .PERIOD 
And it's just another place from which to observe .PERIOD And the understanding that there are no absolute ,COMMA all-knowing insiders .PERIOD 
In this context ,COMMA i'll just show you a few .PERIOD 
This is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger ,COMMA who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health ,COMMA with advancements in science and technology .PERIOD All for the cost of <NUM> thousand dollars for forever .PERIOD 
And in this i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting .PERIOD So i spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD 
And the film was shot on <NUM> millimeter ,COMMA government-issue film .PERIOD 
I investigate ,COMMA photography's ability to blur truth and fiction and its influence on memory ,COMMA which can lead to severe ,COMMA even lethal consequences .PERIOD 
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images .PERIOD 
But through exposure to composite sketches ,COMMA polaroids mug shots and line-ups ,COMMA eyewitness testimony can change .PERIOD 
And he served <NUM> years of a life sentence .PERIOD 
Ron williamson ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club ,COMMA and served <NUM> years of a death sentence .PERIOD 
Ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman .PERIOD 
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis .PERIOD And more people are being found out .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA these two show great growth in income ,COMMA absolutely flat .PERIOD Happiness :COLON curves .PERIOD 
My field the field of psychology ,COMMA hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD 
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity .PERIOD 
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in ,COMMA turn on ,COMMA drop out ,COMMA thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD 
We've come away from the freudian gloom .PERIOD And people are now actively studying this .PERIOD 
Absent from this list ,COMMA and absent from any discussions of happiness ,COMMA are happiness in another's happiness .PERIOD 
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter .PERIOD 
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures .PERIOD 
It turned out that it wasn't that it really is a system of motivation ,COMMA a system of wanting .PERIOD 
There is a profound need to belong .PERIOD 
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important .PERIOD 
There's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin ,COMMA and the opiates ,COMMA which says ,COMMA this is a long-term bond .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a person can be in a long term attachment ,COMMA become romantically infatuated with someone else ,COMMA and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD 
So if you look at questions like this ,COMMA life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD 
You .PERIOD See mental distress going up with lower income .PERIOD 
But the effect is relatively small .PERIOD 
And sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth ,COMMA adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected ,COMMA before the change ,COMMA and much more post-materialist values after .PERIOD 
I had all kinds of rats ,COMMA mice ,COMMA hamsters ,COMMA gerbils .PERIOD Squirrels .PERIOD 
Growing up in a multicultural environment ,COMMA we had african students in the house ,COMMA and i learned about their stories .PERIOD So different backgrounds ,COMMA dependency on imported know-how ,COMMA goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity .PERIOD 
Princess ,COMMA diana ,COMMA is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true .PERIOD 
And actually our product -- what you see here .PERIOD 
Rats have been used since the '50s last century ,COMMA in all kinds of experiments .PERIOD 
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in our common language dutch the name for tb .PERIOD 
It gets a click sound ,COMMA and comes for the food reward .PERIOD 
And by doing so very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative .PERIOD 
Just as an indication ,COMMA whereas a microscopist can process <NUM> samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .PERIOD 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis .PERIOD 
Throughout last year ,COMMA we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between <NUM> and <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And there are simple things .PERIOD Like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards .PERIOD And to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale ,COMMA and affect the lives of many more people .PERIOD 
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you go about studying the brain .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one ,COMMA recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues ,COMMA is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .PERIOD 
So here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something .PERIOD 
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action .PERIOD 
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK Why is imitation important .PERIOD 
And i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD 
A human being a child can just watch its parent kill another polar bear ,COMMA and skin it ,COMMA and put the skin on its body ,COMMA fur on the body and learn it in one step .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK The polar bear took <NUM> years to learn ,COMMA it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .PERIOD 
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD 
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers .PERIOD 
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .PERIOD 
The little hole in the middle ,COMMA we'll come to a bit later .PERIOD But that's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube .PERIOD 
So that's <NUM> micrometers across ,COMMA that pollen grain there .PERIOD 
It's also very biologically active as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD 
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species .PERIOD 
Again -- this time ,COMMA sycamore -- wind-dispersed .PERIOD 
Cool ?QUESTIONMARK Pollen though .PERIOD 
Remember that thing is just about <NUM> micrometers across .PERIOD 
Now it's much more efficient .PERIOD If you can get insects to do your bidding .PERIOD 
The pollen has little barbs on it .PERIOD If we look .PERIOD 
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized ,COMMA this pollen .PERIOD 
Isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics .PERIOD 
So not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD 
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that i'm wearing .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
And that is the <NUM> years that women have advocated .PERIOD 
We have effective therapies now .PERIOD 
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease .PERIOD 
So in the wise <NUM> years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations ,COMMA and we should probably follow up on that .PERIOD 
Had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again ,COMMA this is millions of people happening every day -- women ,COMMA in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery .PERIOD So the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode ,COMMA men explode .PERIOD 
Ekg goes pbbrrhh .PERIOD So the doctors can see ,COMMA this hugely abnormal ekg .PERIOD 
So what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA unlike the cat scans x-rays ,COMMA thalliums for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart ,COMMA every time .PERIOD We order something that has even a small amount of radiation .PERIOD We say ,COMMA do we really need that test .PERIOD 
And those little red boxes are deaths .PERIOD 
One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease ,COMMA women do ,COMMA on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women .PERIOD 
So we're <NUM> years behind .PERIOD 
Women participate .PERIOD 
Deb roy ,COMMA this moment ,COMMA and thousands ,COMMA of other moments special for us ,COMMA were captured in our home because in every room in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone .PERIOD And if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room .PERIOD 
This is my wife and i cooking breakfast in the kitchen ,COMMA and as we move through space and through time ,COMMA a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen .PERIOD 
In order to convert this opaque <NUM> hours of video into something that we could start to see ,COMMA we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space ,COMMA and through time ,COMMA what we call space-time worms .PERIOD 
No video here :COLON so you can focus on the sound ,COMMA the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory gaga to water .PERIOD 
This is one of the first results that came out of our study ,COMMA a little over a year ago that really surprised us .PERIOD 
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny -- were systematically .PERIOD And i would think ,COMMA subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD 
What about the visual context .PERIOD 
And there's our nanny by the door .PERIOD 
And what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity .PERIOD 
Three of the key people .PERIOD In this project ,COMMA philip decamp rony ,COMMA kubat and brandon roy are pictured here .PERIOD 
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .PERIOD 
We call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room .PERIOD If you will .PERIOD 
And there are fascinating dynamics at play .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together .PERIOD 
Come here .PERIOD 
Oh .PERIOD Boy .PERIOD 
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry .PERIOD Just the simplest of shapes .PERIOD 
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .PERIOD 
You'd be activating the dorsal stream .PERIOD If you did that .PERIOD 
And it's the part that feels .PERIOD 
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information .PERIOD 
We make meaning ,COMMA by seeing ,COMMA by an act of visual interrogation .PERIOD 
This is a time-lapse view of it .PERIOD 
And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .PERIOD 
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD 
Even the lockset is probably worth <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
Then looking up in the turret ,COMMA you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD 
Then on the can .PERIOD It says ,COMMA this is the famous budweiser beer ,COMMA we know of ,COMMA no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah .PERIOD 
This little house here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of bois d'arc or osage orange .PERIOD And these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit .PERIOD 
That's one of those new chocolate ,COMMA cell ,COMMA phones .PERIOD 
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features .PERIOD 
On the one hand ,COMMA we have an apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect .PERIOD 
The dionysian personality takes the picture and goes .PERIOD 
Oops :COLON scratch ,COMMA dumpster .PERIOD 
And here's a story ,COMMA jim tulles .PERIOD One of the guys i trained ,COMMA i said ,COMMA jim ,COMMA it's time now .PERIOD 
Jim now it's time you're the down .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD 
Good call tulles from now on you guys hit this pile first .PERIOD 
But once in a while you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials .PERIOD 
How disgusting .PERIOD 
It's a pretty quick read .PERIOD 
But as soon as you walk in ,COMMA i go ooh spaghetti sauce there .PERIOD 
I feel that expectation .PERIOD And so i accommodate it ,COMMA and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do .PERIOD 
Wildebeests ,COMMA don't hang with lions ,COMMA because lions eat wildebeests .PERIOD 
And so you see this in junior high ,COMMA a lot .PERIOD 
On the bottom tier we have basic needs -- shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD 
We can't even afford to eat anything except beans .PERIOD 
We're in trouble .PERIOD 
And it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness ,COMMA why am i not visible in the photograph ,COMMA and where is this time ?QUESTIONMARK And place .PERIOD 
This is a police photo .PERIOD That's actually my car .PERIOD 
I'm put on full life support .PERIOD And i have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD 
And this is how we began .PERIOD 
Now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india in madhya pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock .PERIOD Art found .PERIOD 
While i was producing in los angeles ,COMMA i never thought about it for a second .PERIOD 
Here's my brain .PERIOD 
And this person is particularly interesting .PERIOD 
The craniomandibular system is critical to that .PERIOD 
If that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say ,COMMA and rather a bold statement -- how can the jaw affect the entire body ?QUESTIONMARK -- let me simply point out to you .PERIOD If i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long ,COMMA walk ,COMMA how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA tiny misalignment .PERIOD 
Bear in mind .PERIOD There are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD 
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows it's hard to see the difference .PERIOD 
This is an mri mra mrv ,COMMA a volumetric ,COMMA mri .PERIOD 
I've brought with me from southern california .PERIOD The fm device .PERIOD 
And when i came out of my coma ,COMMA i recognized my family ,COMMA but i didn't remember my own past .PERIOD 
And i whispered the good news through my broken jaw which was wired shut to my night nurse .PERIOD 
And during my time ,COMMA in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA when i heard simon's -- please sit down .PERIOD I just want to talk to him for a second -- when i read his book ,COMMA i went to la to meet him .PERIOD 
The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to every treatment he got ,COMMA every near-miss he had ,COMMA and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .PERIOD 
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg .PERIOD 
Because the chimpanzee would score half right .PERIOD If i gave them two bananas with sri lanka .PERIOD And turkey they would be right half of the cases .PERIOD 
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine ,COMMA and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i first discovered that the textbook was tintin ,COMMA mainly .PERIOD 
And what do you mean with western world ?QUESTIONMARK I said .PERIOD 
And <NUM> ,COMMA there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families ,COMMA and long lives .PERIOD 
One dollar ,COMMA <NUM> dollars or <NUM> dollars per day .PERIOD 
There's a little hump here ,COMMA but there are people all the way .PERIOD 
We heard it in other forms ,COMMA and who are these .PERIOD 
Where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK I can show you africa .PERIOD 
The problem in the world was the poverty in asia .PERIOD And if i now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that while population increase ,COMMA there are hundreds of millions in asia ,COMMA getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty .PERIOD And this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD 
I can go here ,COMMA and i can split sub-saharan africa into its countries .PERIOD 
And when it burst ,COMMA the size of its country bubble is the size of the population .PERIOD 
Today we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america .PERIOD 
The richest <NUM> percent of ugandans are there .PERIOD 
And we started to write software which could link the data like this .PERIOD 
So i first went to copenhagen ,COMMA because i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe i could become a biochemist ,COMMA but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .PERIOD 
But wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought dna was the best bet .PERIOD And he showed this x-ray photograph .PERIOD 
And there i met francis crick .PERIOD 
I went there without knowing him .PERIOD He was <NUM> .PERIOD I was <NUM> .PERIOD 
And within a day we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna .PERIOD 
And the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins .PERIOD And in doing so he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA sir lawrence bragg .PERIOD Who was the cavendish professor .PERIOD 
This is a photograph ,COMMA several years later ,COMMA when bragg had cause to smile .PERIOD 
And they had the wisdom to say ,COMMA no ,COMMA so he didn't have it .PERIOD 
But there was ones in the literature .PERIOD 
So this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected ,COMMA from the world's -- -- and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups .PERIOD 
And a month after we got the pauling manuscript -- i should say ,COMMA i took the manuscript to london and showed the people .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we got the answer on the 28th ,COMMA february '<NUM> .PERIOD 
So i changed the locations .PERIOD And then we found the base pairing .PERIOD And francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions .PERIOD 
So we saw how genetic information is carried .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA didn't yield .PERIOD It .PERIOD Didn't give good x-ray photographs .PERIOD 
It was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD 
Well at that time -- i should go back .PERIOD 
And then they learned how to read the letters for the code .PERIOD 
There's a chip there ,COMMA a conventional one :COLON then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen ,COMMA which is way ahead of affymetrix .PERIOD 
And we use their technique .PERIOD 
Which is all of us have about <NUM> places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA it's a really big idea .PERIOD 
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually ,COMMA in this iron lung ,COMMA to breathe for them .PERIOD 
And it happened so fast in the united states .PERIOD However ,COMMA that even just last month ,COMMA jon stewart said this ,COMMA jon stewart :COLON where is polio still active .PERIOD 
They had come from thousands of miles away .PERIOD 
It doesn't survive in the environment ,COMMA hardly at all .PERIOD 
And we've got pretty good vaccines as i've just showed you .PERIOD 
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after .PERIOD 
So it was a massive effort .PERIOD 
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history .PERIOD 
Now giving the polio vaccine is :COLON simple .PERIOD 
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than <NUM> years ,COMMA much longer than it should have -- but once it was built ,COMMA the results were striking .PERIOD 
Last year it was <NUM> .PERIOD 
We should abandon this idea of eradication .PERIOD 
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough .PERIOD 
Umar was paralyzed for life .PERIOD 
As you probably can't see the detail here ,COMMA but this is his report card .PERIOD And you'll see ,COMMA he's got perfect scores .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'd love to be able to tell you that .PERIOD Umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true .PERIOD 
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had ,COMMA and we immediately started using this .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA in a couple of months ,COMMA we had to get it out of production .PERIOD 
And we didn't start with the easy places .PERIOD 
So this morning ,COMMA at about seven o'clock ,COMMA i decided that we'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india ,COMMA again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible .PERIOD 
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh ,COMMA or bihar .PERIOD 
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .PERIOD 
Beverly joubert :COLON we are truly passionate about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness .PERIOD And so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats .PERIOD 
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality ,COMMA that individual personality that these animals have .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we needn't have worried .PERIOD 
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA from beverly -- and just pushing the envelope going out there ,COMMA pushing our vehicle ,COMMA pushing ourselves .PERIOD 
We don't always get that right ?QUESTIONMARK And on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated :COLON the depth .PERIOD 
But that's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters .PERIOD 
Sleep !EXCLAMATIONMARK Deprivation is extreme .PERIOD 
But for <NUM> years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night .PERIOD 
This elephant ,COMMA against overwhelming odds ,COMMA simply gives up hope .PERIOD 
But by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again .PERIOD 
Beverly sits on the one side where all her camera gear is .PERIOD And i'm on the other side where my space is .PERIOD 
These are precious to us .PERIOD These divides .PERIOD 
But when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear ,COMMA she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA we knew now that she was going to survive .PERIOD 
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety ,COMMA protecting it from the hyena .PERIOD 
But i have to tell you -- everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon .PERIOD 
We had to deal with these individual personalities .PERIOD 
There's an immense amount of poaching as well .PERIOD And so possibly the same amount .PERIOD 
Richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair's breadth of accuracy .PERIOD 
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly .PERIOD In the middle of a sports stadium and the next atom is in the next sports stadium .PERIOD 
As an evolutionary biologist ,COMMA i'd say this :COLON our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed ,COMMA which our bodies operate at .PERIOD We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms .PERIOD 
Moving to the other end of the scale ,COMMA our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD If they had our brains would be much better at understanding einstein .PERIOD I want to give the name middle world to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with middle earth .PERIOD 
He stared at his wall in arlington virginia ,COMMA and decided to do it .PERIOD 
Then general stubblebine banged ,COMMA his nose hard on the wall of his office stubblebine ,COMMA who commanded <NUM> soldiers ?QUESTIONMARK Was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD 
I have every reason to think it's true .PERIOD I was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it .PERIOD 
And that's because in middle world ,COMMA air friction is always there .PERIOD 
We have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .PERIOD 
Steve ,COMMA grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA you really were there at the time .PERIOD Weren't you .PERIOD 
Not a single atom that is in your body .PERIOD Today was there .PERIOD When that event took place ,COMMA matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you .PERIOD 
So really isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD 
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model .PERIOD While the swallow uses light is incidental .PERIOD 
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells .PERIOD Just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD 
We're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us .PERIOD 
One way to think about that is by counting planets .PERIOD 
In short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars ,COMMA but when we revert to being human .PERIOD We behave more like basil fawlty ,COMMA who we remember ,COMMA thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night .PERIOD 
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans .PERIOD It's hardly surprising .PERIOD The same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate ,COMMA like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole .PERIOD 
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .PERIOD 
Now :COLON cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water .PERIOD As you can see there .PERIOD 
So what excites me about cymatics .PERIOD 
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world .PERIOD 
We can also use cymatics for healing and education .PERIOD 
This image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device .PERIOD

We're heading to the future of bits ,COMMA where everything is speedy ,COMMA it's weightless .PERIOD 
Here's what i think is going on .PERIOD 
It includes things like the internet cables .PERIOD

It's been ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA close to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Every once in a while ,COMMA i get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional .PERIOD 
And i've always felt guilty about that .PERIOD 
I hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you .PERIOD 
Would you describe that as global citizenship .PERIOD 
I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents .PERIOD 
But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship ,COMMA but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism ,COMMA and how to combine these two .PERIOD 
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward .PERIOD Unless there is trade between the different countries .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain's long-term interests .PERIOD What is necessary for america's long-term interests .PERIOD Is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is necessary .PERIOD 
And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa ,COMMA to work ,COMMA together for common causes ,COMMA then the danger of al qaeda and related groups making progress in africa is very big .PERIOD 
And i wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD 
Where was the early warning systems .PERIOD 
All these things have happened .PERIOD 
Even if as a human being ,COMMA you believe that ,COMMA you can't say that you're elected for britain's interests .PERIOD 
Since then ,COMMA the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people's concern about the rights of individuals ,COMMA within territories where they need protection .PERIOD Partly because of what we saw in rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in bosnia .PERIOD 
The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk ,COMMA is now being established as a principle ,COMMA which governs the world .PERIOD 
So while i can't automatically say that ,COMMA britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger ,COMMA i can say that britain is in a position where we're working with other countries .PERIOD So that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack ,COMMA is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD 
America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through .PERIOD Congress .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA god shook his head and said ,COMMA not this year ,COMMA not this decade ,COMMA perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD 
And bill clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted .PERIOD 
So that's kind of a bold statement .PERIOD 
And it's technological ,COMMA so it can do things like microelectronics ,COMMA and maybe photonics do .PERIOD 
And the material looks something like this .PERIOD 
The process of discovery ,COMMA generally ,COMMA is inspired by nature .PERIOD 
They find their way to self-assemble .PERIOD 
And we can store information that's film with water and protein .PERIOD 
You can imagine that ,COMMA then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light .PERIOD And so we've made optical fibers .PERIOD 
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .PERIOD 
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .PERIOD 
And you see there ,COMMA it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD 
So you have a clock ,COMMA you have protein .PERIOD And now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .PERIOD 
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before .PERIOD 
Some people in the last decade or two ,COMMA have started creating artwork with technology .PERIOD 
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA guys ,COMMA are looking good out there .PERIOD 
Data ,COMMA here's the first one .PERIOD 
One of them falls to the ground .PERIOD 
I can help .PERIOD 
You've been a great audience .PERIOD 
There's a lot more to come .PERIOD 
Then he said ,COMMA but really sarah ,COMMA you could have worked harder .PERIOD Can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK It's really too small .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA it's rather small .PERIOD 
One day while my father was working on a file for us to obtain french nationality ,COMMA i happened to see some documents that caught my attention .PERIOD 
These are real .PERIOD 
So his story ,COMMA my father was born in argentina .PERIOD 
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry ,COMMA because it was the only consolation for his sadness .PERIOD 
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD 
But it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance .PERIOD 
In those times documents had hard covers ,COMMA they were filled in by hand .PERIOD And they stated your job .PERIOD 
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials .PERIOD He invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .PERIOD 
Time passed ,COMMA and they thought he had surely forgotten them at first .PERIOD 
And then i understood that asking my father ,COMMA so many questions was stirring up a whole past .PERIOD He probably didn't feel like talking about because it was painful .PERIOD 
In africa there were countries fighting for their independence guinea .PERIOD Guinea-bissau angola .PERIOD 
There was also latin america .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
We live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth .PERIOD 
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability .PERIOD 
So i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage ,COMMA to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey .PERIOD Which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Here used as a proxy ,COMMA temperature variability .PERIOD 
It was a jumpy ride .PERIOD <NUM> years back in a crisis we leave africa .PERIOD We colonize australia in another crisis .PERIOD <NUM> years back ,COMMA we leave asia for europe in another crisis .PERIOD <NUM> years back ,COMMA and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development .PERIOD 
The majority of the planet ,COMMA aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development ,COMMA are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD 
Now you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet ,COMMA a resilient planet .PERIOD But unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline .PERIOD 
Now if we have evidence ,COMMA which we now have ,COMMA that wetlands ,COMMA forests ,COMMA [unclear] monsoon system ,COMMA the rainforests behave in this nonlinear way .PERIOD 
And could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems ,COMMA science ,COMMA identify the thresholds ,COMMA the points where we may expect nonlinear change .PERIOD 
Now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries .PERIOD 
In the '60s ,COMMA already ,COMMA through the green revolution and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know ,COMMA human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole .PERIOD 
There's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from latin america ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s led farming basically to a dead-end ,COMMA with lower and lower yields ,COMMA degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood ,COMMA levels in paraguay ,COMMA uruguay ,COMMA and a number of countries brazil leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies .PERIOD Which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries ,COMMA have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch ,COMMA zero till farming which not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon .PERIOD 
It has to basically do this on current land .PERIOD 
Elinor ostrom ,COMMA the latest nobel laureate of economics clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons .PERIOD If we invest in trust ,COMMA local ,COMMA action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors ,COMMA together ,COMMA can deal with the global commons .PERIOD At a large scale .PERIOD 
Where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people .PERIOD 
So there is scientific evidence .PERIOD 
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD 
You know .PERIOD Creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us .PERIOD See a chicken on his hindquarters .PERIOD 
And another point -- why i'm here -- is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy ,COMMA i rented ,COMMA a tuxedo ,COMMA for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing -- didn't have any friends .PERIOD 
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles .PERIOD 
And that's how -- with this money i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in <NUM> .PERIOD And that's very -- the basic reason i'm talking to you here today .PERIOD Because i got shot .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete ,COMMA because it was designed for atari platform .PERIOD 
But i was still ,COMMA you know -- this is a kitty cloud .PERIOD 
The :COLON snail .PERIOD 
And your eye doesn't know which level to read .PERIOD 
And they would look at it -- ah ,COMMA it's a pencil ,COMMA drawing .PERIOD 
It had a physicality ,COMMA and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image .PERIOD So ,COMMA this is monkey with leica .PERIOD 
And i wanted to deal with other subjects .PERIOD 
I got some photographs from them .PERIOD 
And jackson pollock also .PERIOD 
I used the dust at the whitney museum to render some pieces of their collection .PERIOD 
And i picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity .PERIOD 
They do a dna scan of this .PERIOD They will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD 
Also the reference to gerhard richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation ;SEMICOLON that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map .PERIOD 
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i paid like three dollars .PERIOD I think -- and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello by an amateur group .PERIOD 
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that .PERIOD 
And the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed ,COMMA these strands come apart ,COMMA new strands are synthesized with the old ones ,COMMA as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA an interesting question is ,COMMA what happened when we met .PERIOD 
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna ,COMMA how you convert it to a form .PERIOD You can sequence .PERIOD 
The same is true :COLON if we look at a chinese individual versus an african ,COMMA the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .PERIOD 
And further back <NUM> years ago ,COMMA is there a common origin with present day humans .PERIOD 
But we do find it in papua ,COMMA new guinea ,COMMA and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific .PERIOD 
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were .PERIOD But we know that in southern siberia ,COMMA there were both neanderthals and denisovans ,COMMA at least ,COMMA at some time in the past .PERIOD 
And since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA i'm pretty sure that one day ,COMMA when we will ,COMMA perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa .PERIOD We will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa .PERIOD 
And if i were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions ,COMMA because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do ,COMMA and who they are .PERIOD 
My overall project is about art -- specifically about black artists -- very ,COMMA generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .PERIOD 
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ?QUESTIONMARK The me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient totally important .PERIOD 
To this end ,COMMA the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions ,COMMA all titled with an f -- freestyle ,COMMA frequency and flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young ,COMMA black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years .PERIOD 
It is really ,COMMA in this sense of discovery ,COMMA that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking .PERIOD 
But really ,COMMA it has been what i've discovered about myself ,COMMA and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty ,COMMA to talk about power ,COMMA to talk about ourselves ,COMMA and to talk and speak to each other .PERIOD 
And you put on the t-10 ,COMMA parachute .PERIOD 
They give <NUM> minutes -- that's a time warning .PERIOD 
And that's to boost everybody's confidence .PERIOD To show that you're not scared .PERIOD 
Then they give you get ready .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA nice air comes flowing in .PERIOD 
So then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA this is good .PERIOD 
In 30-some years of jumping ,COMMA i never did one .PERIOD 
And i realized that if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them .PERIOD And they would follow leaders .PERIOD 
So now i do that tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump -- that was september 11th ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Sort of leadership by humiliation .PERIOD 
I've got to use video teleconferences ,COMMA i've got to use chat ,COMMA i've got to use email ,COMMA i've got to use phone calls -- i've got to use everything i can not just for communication .PERIOD But for leadership .PERIOD 
And that's a new kind of leadership for me .PERIOD 
So we had to get complex intelligence together .PERIOD We had to line up the ability to act .PERIOD 
In reality ,COMMA much of the force .PERIOD I led looked exactly like you .PERIOD 
And so instead of giving orders you're now building consensus ,COMMA and you're building a sense of shared purpose .PERIOD 
It also produced something ,COMMA which i call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD 
And it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD 
And every morning in the ranger regiment ,COMMA every ranger -- and there are more than <NUM> of them -- says a six-stanza ranger creed .PERIOD 
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .PERIOD 
That was my journey .PERIOD 
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right .PERIOD They're good ,COMMA because they're willing to learn and to trust .PERIOD 
Alex steffen :COLON and i founded worldchanging in late <NUM> ,COMMA and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there ,COMMA right now .PERIOD And on the near horizon .PERIOD 
As norwegian social scientist evelin lindner has observed ,COMMA pessimism is a luxury of good times .PERIOD 
In difficult times ,COMMA pessimism is a self-fulfilling ,COMMA self-inflicted death sentence .PERIOD 
Community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising ,COMMA or a natural disaster is unfolding .PERIOD Can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD 
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government to the blairwatch project in the uk .PERIOD Keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press .PERIOD 
Now imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists .PERIOD 
Imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet :COLON putting news and data at the fingertips of people ,COMMA of all kinds from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA just to be clear in this talk i'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,COMMA not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization .PERIOD 
Earth witness would show us two worlds ,COMMA the world we're leaving behind and the world .PERIOD We're building for generations to come .PERIOD 
After this ,COMMA we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see .PERIOD 
Make yourself understood to the computer .PERIOD 
And he couldn't travel .PERIOD So i went over there .PERIOD 
And all over india ,COMMA at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to google their homework .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we did .PERIOD 
So i said ,COMMA for two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff you didn't understand .PERIOD 
It took me three years to publish that .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA no use .PERIOD The method of the grandmother .PERIOD 
What is that ?QUESTIONMARK Can you do that again ?QUESTIONMARK Can you show me some more' she did that for two months .PERIOD 
The scores went up to <NUM> ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of new delhi ,COMMA with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting .PERIOD 
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
The average score when i'd done it with the computers .PERIOD And the groups was <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Back at gateshead ,COMMA a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA stuff which i don't know anything about .PERIOD 
This is a sole in newcastle .PERIOD 
I started writing english questions on the blackboard .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
Thanks .PERIOD 
I was too young ,COMMA unmarried ,COMMA i had no children didn't really know africa .PERIOD And besides ,COMMA my french was pitiful .PERIOD 
So then i went the whole american way with competitions ,COMMA team and individual ,COMMA completely failed .PERIOD But over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA blue ,COMMA blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD 
I think ,COMMA andrew ,COMMA pretty well covered that so i will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD 
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers ,COMMA create jobs directly ,COMMA and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector and africa loses about <NUM> billion dollars a year because of malaria .PERIOD 
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused .PERIOD 
He was actually living in the kibera slums when his father called him ,COMMA and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential .PERIOD 
Samuel's kids are in private school ,COMMA and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth .PERIOD 
The next one ,COMMA many of you know .PERIOD 
And so from an enterprise perspective for africa ,COMMA and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes .PERIOD 
We can start building local distribution ,COMMA and actually it can cost the public sector much less .PERIOD 
One that people will pay different prices .PERIOD But the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it .PERIOD 
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes .PERIOD 
And we came up with some parameters because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA building a rube goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .PERIOD 
Of those <NUM> takes only three actually successfully completed their run .PERIOD 
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .PERIOD 
It think we can do better than this .PERIOD Hello tedxusc .PERIOD 
Let me start again .PERIOD 
Where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD So that's the human part .PERIOD 
And in that <NUM> percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind .PERIOD Thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them ,COMMA get them .PERIOD So they really think ask tough questions :COLON argue about serious subjects .PERIOD Don't believe everything that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative ,COMMA they can be .PERIOD 
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail .PERIOD 
This was the full size of the original creature .PERIOD 
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .PERIOD 
Buckminster fuller said it clearly .PERIOD There are no passengers on spaceship earth ,COMMA only crew .PERIOD We the crew ,COMMA can ,COMMA and must do more with less -- much less .PERIOD 
It's amazing just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there .PERIOD 
We couldn't bring one here to fly it ,COMMA and show you .PERIOD 
But there's a lot of technology going .PERIOD 
Sorry .PERIOD 
It never makes a mistake .PERIOD Because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny .PERIOD 
In concluding ,COMMA i want to get back to the big picture ,COMMA and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD 
And so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD This is not a forecast .PERIOD 
Last night ,COMMA we gave it a few too many turns ,COMMA and it tried to bash the roof out also ,COMMA it's about a gram .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And despite their ferocious appearance ,COMMA tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals .PERIOD 
But inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous ,COMMA ulcerating tumors like this one here .PERIOD 
They were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD 
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer ,COMMA that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population .PERIOD 
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine ,COMMA when i was only <NUM> .PERIOD 
Paradoxically ,COMMA once established natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer .PERIOD 
So cancer could be thought of as a strange ,COMMA short-lived ,COMMA self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually ,COMMA probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil -- and jonas was clearly a male .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas' ?QUESTIONMARK Face .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania .PERIOD 
They tend to bite each other ,COMMA often quite ferociously ,COMMA and usually on the face .PERIOD 
But if this can happen in tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals ?QUESTIONMARK Or even humans .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the answer is ,COMMA it has .PERIOD 
She took him to the vet ,COMMA and the vet discovered something quite disgusting .PERIOD 
So we've seen that this can happen in animals .PERIOD 
Ad ,COMMA he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD 
Most of the people that dr .PERIOD Southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells .PERIOD 
And i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future .PERIOD 
Why has the record been so poor .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
The security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security .PERIOD 
It does increase security .PERIOD 
One is jobs .PERIOD 
Now that is difficult .PERIOD 
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms .PERIOD 
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know that's not a realistic agenda .PERIOD And so what they also do is the total bypass ,COMMA just fund ngos .PERIOD 
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry ,COMMA up into three .PERIOD 
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to the united states ,COMMA government and some ngo .PERIOD 
And basically what i'd like to tell you is that power is changing .PERIOD And there are two types of changes i want to discuss .PERIOD 
What we're going to see in the 21st century is asia ,COMMA gradually returning to being more than half of the world's population ,COMMA and more than half of the world's product .PERIOD 
It's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though war still persists .PERIOD 
If we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states .PERIOD 
And that the chinese won't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part after <NUM> of this century .PERIOD 
Why does it matter who cares .PERIOD 
The answer is it matters quite a lot .PERIOD 
So empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody ,COMMA and it's not a zero sum .PERIOD I win ,COMMA you lose .PERIOD 
How do we define our national interests so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum .PERIOD 
The world has a new mania .PERIOD 
A mania for learning english .PERIOD 
T ,COMMA i don't want to let myself down .PERIOD 
T :COLON perfect .PERIOD S .PERIOD Perfect .PERIOD 
S ,COMMA i want to change my life .PERIOD 
So is english mania good or bad .PERIOD 
And now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .PERIOD 
It's a true feeling .PERIOD 
Why is this old table in your office ?QUESTIONMARK 
And as i grew up ,COMMA i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table .PERIOD I began to call it the wisdom table .PERIOD 
And i was so shocked ,COMMA so stunned ,COMMA i got up and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD But what do i do .PERIOD 
And that question cleared the space .PERIOD 
This film is called world peace and other 4th grade achievements .PERIOD 
And it's a beautiful thing .PERIOD 
And i saw miss ethel .PERIOD J banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .PERIOD 
And i'm not even talking about you behind me because i've got eyes in the back of my head .PERIOD 
And really ,COMMA i feel as though ,COMMA when i see the film -- i have a gesture she does like this -- i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA this world peace game i'd like to tell you about .PERIOD 
I didn't want to lecture or have just book ,COMMA reading .PERIOD 
I offer them the job ,COMMA they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD 
That's not all .PERIOD 
I throw them into this complex matrix ,COMMA and they trust me ,COMMA because we have a deep rich relationship together .PERIOD 
There's oil spills ,COMMA environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ,COMMA breakaway republics ,COMMA famine ,COMMA endangered species and global warming .PERIOD 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever .PERIOD Once they start playing .PERIOD 
And because i don't know ,COMMA they've got to dig up the answer .PERIOD 
My question to you is ,COMMA who's in charge of that classroom .PERIOD 
And we were very upset .PERIOD 
I could not have designed that in teaching it .PERIOD 
It'll be more realer if she reads it .PERIOD 
We have a lot of data ,COMMA but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on .PERIOD 
And there are three seconds left on the clock .PERIOD 
I joined telco made tata trucks ,COMMA pretty close to pune .PERIOD 
So i took one year off ,COMMA and i went to this village science program .PERIOD 
This square might look very square and prim .PERIOD 
But give a child a triangle ,COMMA he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD 
They always make a triangular roof .PERIOD 
Now this is people science .PERIOD 
The insects are eaten by the frogs .PERIOD The frogs are eaten by the snakes .PERIOD The snakes are eaten by the eagles .PERIOD 
And you put a little fan here .PERIOD 
And this is a hundred-year-old toy .PERIOD 
I just put this inside this .PERIOD 
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this .PERIOD 
This is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins .PERIOD 
It's the interaction of both these magnets ,COMMA which makes this motor spin .PERIOD 
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic ,COMMA aluminum -- which are are sealed together .PERIOD 
I'm going to keep this outside to blow out .PERIOD I'm going to suck in air .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA before i go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing .PERIOD 
If i crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD 
When first you see nehru and gandhi ,COMMA this is the nehru cap -- just half a newspaper .PERIOD 
And the second night ,COMMA he would take the same cap and give it another fold .PERIOD 
And there's a third one over here .PERIOD 
Firstly ?QUESTIONMARK Radical increases in resource efficiency .PERIOD 
And for all three of these ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need .PERIOD 
And i'm just going to talk through this animation .PERIOD 
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time .PERIOD There's a real sense with this project ,COMMA that the number of possibilities just continue increasing .PERIOD 
And the kind of elements i'm talking about are ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse ,COMMA a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA when julius caesar arrived in north africa ,COMMA huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests .PERIOD 
The converse is also true .PERIOD 
The more vegetation we lose ,COMMA the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further ,COMMA desertification .PERIOD 
The way it does this is it comes out at night ,COMMA crawls to the top of a sand dune .PERIOD And because it's got a matte black shell ,COMMA is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD 
And the ingenuity ,COMMA if you could call it that goes even further .PERIOD 
Between them there's a waxy ,COMMA finish which repels water .PERIOD 
We're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse .PERIOD 
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions .PERIOD And the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills .PERIOD And you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process .PERIOD 
And what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside .PERIOD 
And when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition .PERIOD 
You think ,COMMA what can i add to the system to create more value .PERIOD 
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD 
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine .PERIOD 
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts ,COMMA transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity .PERIOD 
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language .PERIOD 
And this is an important point .PERIOD 
There are very few doctors ,COMMA and ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics .PERIOD 
Very simple .PERIOD 
And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science .PERIOD 
It also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA i kept wondering what will be its first killer app .PERIOD 
Let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD 
And it should be able to tell us that .PERIOD 
Let's say the revenue of microsoft .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA even starting from mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA a crucial idea of wolfram alpha is that you can just ask it questions using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them .PERIOD 
And i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible .PERIOD 
Right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of them ,COMMA get handled successfully .PERIOD The first time .PERIOD 
And when one does that one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere .PERIOD 
I'll show you one example here .PERIOD 
Something like rule <NUM> ,COMMA for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator .PERIOD 
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
But in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which ,COMMA when it gets big enough ,COMMA behaves like continuous space in much ,COMMA the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid .PERIOD 
Actually i haven't shown these before .PERIOD But here are a few of the candidate universes that i've looked at .PERIOD 
Benoit mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD 
We've questioned the future of capitalism .PERIOD 
And the idea is a simple ,COMMA simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD 
The consumer is empowered .PERIOD 
Do you know what this was right here ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education ,COMMA future children in our households .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA consumers have moved .PERIOD 
Dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth ,COMMA coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress .PERIOD 
But seriously ,COMMA what we see happening .PERIOD And the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat ,COMMA is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out .PERIOD 
We see high-end haggling in fashion today .PERIOD 
So from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD 
Gore-tex is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses .PERIOD 
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living .PERIOD 
I was fascinated to learn that <NUM> percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners .PERIOD 
Let's look at a couple of quick examples .PERIOD 
You need to harness it .PERIOD You need to give it meaning .PERIOD 
This kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD It's a moving truck ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
Or you look at johnson &amp ,COMMA johnson's momversations .PERIOD 
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it .PERIOD 
But at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity .PERIOD 
So i decided to investigate .PERIOD 
So i'm going to challenge all of you .PERIOD 
We talk about world peace .PERIOD 
And i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters ,COMMA sons .PERIOD 
That's what i do in life -- telling stories ,COMMA writing novels -- and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling ,COMMA and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD 
I was born in strasbourg france to turkish parents .PERIOD 
In response she said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA praying is effective .PERIOD But also beware of the power of circles .PERIOD 
We all do .PERIOD 
Our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues ,COMMA family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD 
Instead it generated an atmosphere ,COMMA in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own ,COMMA but as the representative of something larger .PERIOD 
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country :COLON politics :COLON cigarettes and the veil .PERIOD 
I lived in a very vibrant ,COMMA diverse neighborhood ,COMMA where i wrote several of my novels .PERIOD 
What i experienced as a child in that school ,COMMA in madrid ,COMMA is happening in the literary world today .PERIOD 
Meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle ,COMMA constantly .PERIOD Moving .PERIOD 
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn ,COMMA who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness .PERIOD 
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all .PERIOD 
You see there ,COMMA it's about <NUM> billion a year .PERIOD 
R&ampd in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly funded ,COMMA is about <NUM> percent of gdp .PERIOD 
The first thing i want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from wonders of the solar system ,COMMA is that our exploration of the solar system .PERIOD And the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA moon .PERIOD 
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself .PERIOD But we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD 
And what's important about that is that on our planet on earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life .PERIOD 
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .PERIOD 
And they saw strange pictures like this .PERIOD 
It's called helios -- helios from the sun .PERIOD 
That's a type ia supernova explosion .PERIOD 
It sits there about ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> times the mass of the sun .PERIOD 
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics .PERIOD Because we understand that process because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth .PERIOD 
And if i blow it up there ,COMMA you see it .PERIOD 
But it visited jupiter ,COMMA saturn ,COMMA uranus and neptune .PERIOD 
You could have made it in the 1890s ;SEMICOLON you wouldn't have the transistor .PERIOD 
Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine ,COMMA humphrey davy ,COMMA who did his science at the turn of the 19th century .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Streets have names .PERIOD Blocks are ,COMMA just the unnamed spaces in between streets .PERIOD 
They say ,COMMA oh well ,COMMA that's block .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD And this is block .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
Just look at google maps .PERIOD Here .PERIOD There's block .PERIOD <NUM> <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
You say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood ,COMMA i noticed that the house numbers don't go in order .PERIOD 
It's a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking .PERIOD And it is very big business .PERIOD 
Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table .PERIOD And i asked her ,COMMA is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school .PERIOD 
I go to work ,COMMA i check email ,COMMA i log onto a few more social sites ,COMMA i blog ,COMMA i check more news reports .PERIOD I share some of those news reports .PERIOD I go look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day -- in this case ,COMMA actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile .PERIOD 
And i’d say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i’m walking for the environment .PERIOD 
I called my parents up .PERIOD 
And so i did .PERIOD 
It’s only <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
I had written the university of montana ,COMMA two years earlier and said ,COMMA i'd like to go to school there .PERIOD 
But i use that story ,COMMA because they really wanted to help me .PERIOD 
I had <NUM> students .PERIOD When i first walked into the class .PERIOD 
I could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out .PERIOD 
They had to take that class with me .PERIOD 
And on earth ,COMMA day <NUM> -- the 20th anniversary of earth day -- that’s when i began to speak .PERIOD 
I got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and walked through all of the islands and to venezuela .PERIOD 
And i got to -- i start saying free at last -- thank god almighty .PERIOD I’m free .PERIOD At last .PERIOD 
I had no idea i was going to become a un .PERIOD Ambassador .PERIOD 
I was going to have to change .PERIOD 
I know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today .PERIOD 
When does learning begin .PERIOD 
Well today i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .PERIOD 
Now i'm a science reporter .PERIOD 
I write books and magazine articles .PERIOD 
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .PERIOD 
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .PERIOD 
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions ,COMMA like a finger lifted to the wind .PERIOD 
The hunger winter as it came to be known ,COMMA killed some <NUM> people and weakened thousands more .PERIOD 
Learning is one of life's most essential activities .PERIOD And it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .PERIOD 
You'd still have five billion left in change ,COMMA and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .PERIOD 
Now years after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a <NUM> or an airbus ,COMMA you remember those words and that experience .PERIOD 
I mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film ,COMMA airplane .PERIOD 
I spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
One of them also being ,COMMA although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it .PERIOD If it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA can we do an advertising campaign .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA it's really ,COMMA really easy .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it .PERIOD 
Moving over .PERIOD We come ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to consultancy .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model .PERIOD 
That's why i call for the chief detail officer .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression ,COMMA i realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .PERIOD 
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .PERIOD 
And i also was taught ,COMMA coupled with that ,COMMA that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job ,COMMA apparently to help .PERIOD 
This is what jesus asked of us .PERIOD 
That was news to me ,COMMA and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .PERIOD 
And i felt overwhelmed .PERIOD 
And i didn't know what would happen when i ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away .PERIOD 
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .PERIOD 
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because i wasn't doing more ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to make things better .PERIOD 
It became a transaction .PERIOD For me ,COMMA became ,COMMA sort of a trade .PERIOD 
So i spent three months in kenya ,COMMA uganda and tanzania ,COMMA interviewing entrepreneurs that had received <NUM> dollars to start or grow a business .PERIOD 
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD 
But there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if i talked to <NUM> goat herders in a row .PERIOD And some days that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .PERIOD 
I never once was asked for a donation ,COMMA which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
We sent it over to uganda .PERIOD 
When you lend them money ,COMMA and they slowly pay you back over time ,COMMA you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .PERIOD 
So the mapping of participating in the story .PERIOD It actually flows with the up and down .PERIOD 
We make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .PERIOD 
But the good news is ,COMMA i don't think i need to stand here and convince you to care -- i'm not even going to try .PERIOD 
And i'm grateful that whenever i do that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA i am inspired -- i am inspired by the person .PERIOD I am listening to .PERIOD 
What is the future of the human race .PERIOD 
If not what created the universe .PERIOD 
First there were the laws like maxwell's equations ,COMMA and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution ,COMMA and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .PERIOD 
Professor hawking .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD For that answer .PERIOD 
I'm a geologist by training ,COMMA but i love that .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA we're going to see one backing into a crevice ,COMMA and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in ,COMMA makes them .PERIOD Look just like algae .PERIOD 
That's an amazing thing .PERIOD 
And an octopus ain't that amazing now .PERIOD Roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink ,COMMA and when he lands the octopus says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i've been seen .PERIOD 
And now he's gone ,COMMA and so am i .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
That's the lucy species ,COMMA and was found ,COMMA by my research team ,COMMA in december of <NUM> ,COMMA in an area called dikika .PERIOD 
It's in the northeastern part of ethiopia .PERIOD 
You don't just jump into an invitation .PERIOD 
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes .PERIOD That are <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
When you get there ,COMMA this is what you see ,COMMA and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA find ,COMMA elephants ,COMMA rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ,COMMA pigs ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA another one that's a monkey .PERIOD That's a pig ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Here is a close-up of the fossil after five years of cleaning ,COMMA preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long .PERIOD And i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block i just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD 
So then ,COMMA once you've done that the next stage is to know what it is .PERIOD 
You don't see that in chimpanzees ,COMMA and you don't see this very projecting canine .PERIOD 
And how old was she ,COMMA when she died .PERIOD 
That's why we need care from our parents .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA selam unites us ,COMMA all and gives us a unique account on what makes us human .PERIOD 
Up to now ,COMMA the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils .PERIOD The baby fossils ,COMMA were missing .PERIOD 
Imagine somebody coming from mars and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children .PERIOD And he goes back and reports .PERIOD 
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy ,COMMA but they did great .PERIOD 
With an average depth of the oceans of <NUM> meters .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA the high seas covers and provides nearly <NUM> percent of the habitat for life on this earth .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA in theory ,COMMA the global commons ,COMMA belonging to us .PERIOD All .PERIOD 
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement .PERIOD For as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify .PERIOD 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european and northern american rivers that are now .PERIOD So dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five ,COMMA showed up in the uk .PERIOD Just recently .PERIOD 
It's actually a bay .PERIOD 
Coming closer to here .PERIOD The costa rica dome is a recently ,COMMA discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD 
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention ,COMMA so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention .PERIOD 
What i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators .PERIOD It's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column ,COMMA where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found .PERIOD 
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots ,COMMA hotspots .PERIOD 
But not all the vessels have those to date .PERIOD 
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect .PERIOD 
So here we are seven years ,COMMA <NUM> interviews later ,COMMA and i'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick .PERIOD 
And the first thing i say to them is ok ,COMMA well you can't serve yourself ,COMMA you gotta serve others .PERIOD Something of value .PERIOD 
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought ,COMMA i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .PERIOD 
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely ,COMMA years after we're gone .PERIOD 
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .PERIOD 
But what i think comes next is far more interesting .PERIOD 
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here .PERIOD 
Taking it a step further ,COMMA mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .PERIOD 
It's not that it's not possible to feed ,COMMA clothe and house us .PERIOD All and have us live decent lives .PERIOD 
And that's what will happen to us .PERIOD 
I accept where we are .PERIOD 
The future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD 
Imagine our highly-tuned ,COMMA just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .PERIOD 
If we feel it now and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear ,COMMA but fear itself .PERIOD 
We can do this .PERIOD 
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth ,COMMA more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .PERIOD 
We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food .PERIOD Some <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
We've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent ,COMMA meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD 
We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like ,COMMA what do we want to be when we grow up ?QUESTIONMARK When we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality .PERIOD 
We can choose life over fear .PERIOD 
And one more thing archie was suffering from this illness himself .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the situation seemed pretty desperate .PERIOD 
He gives half of them .PERIOD Vitamin b12 .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA cochrane ,COMMA then goes to the germans ,COMMA who are running the prison camp .PERIOD 
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated ,COMMA and he vents his frustrations .PERIOD 
So the symptoms of the complex are no matter how complicated the problem .PERIOD You have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .PERIOD 
You could count them in five minutes .PERIOD 
What is evolution .PERIOD 
How do you do it .PERIOD 
It falls to the floor .PERIOD 
You make lots of money .PERIOD 
Ten percent of americans don't disappear .PERIOD Every year .PERIOD 
I sometimes wonder .PERIOD 
Now i've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months .PERIOD And people sometimes say to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious .PERIOD 
And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk ,COMMA who knows all the answers .PERIOD 
When schools stop doing that all the time ,COMMA i will admit that .PERIOD Yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .PERIOD 
Until then until then i'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex .PERIOD 
They had the god complex in spades .PERIOD 
And after the trial had been running for a little while he gathered together all his colleagues around his table ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results .PERIOD 
Shut it down at once .PERIOD 
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA isn't easy .PERIOD 
So shortly after the war this young man ,COMMA yutaka taniyama developed ,COMMA this amazing conjecture ,COMMA called the taniyama-shimura conjecture .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem .PERIOD 
You prove one ,COMMA you prove the other .PERIOD 
And the problem with leverage is it makes the us .PERIOD Financial system look like this .PERIOD 
That means every bad loan goes bad <NUM> times over .PERIOD 
And as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder .PERIOD So what do banks have in store for you ?QUESTIONMARK Now .PERIOD 
Except ,COMMA we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there ,COMMA that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about <NUM> .PERIOD 
We're going to start to pay them .PERIOD 
This guy runs the china ,COMMA investment corporation .PERIOD 
This is an actual bill .PERIOD 
If you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like .PERIOD 
Everything else is mandated .PERIOD 
That's the short term .PERIOD That's the flame part .PERIOD 
Among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are <NUM> percent of us .PERIOD Gdp investmentm and they're about <NUM> percent of output .PERIOD 
Twenty-one countries came together dozens of teams .PERIOD 
Two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature .PERIOD 
But then ,COMMA if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow .PERIOD Unless if you're a lawyer .PERIOD 
So there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD 
If you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today .PERIOD Are a little different .PERIOD 
And this stuff is moving very quickly .PERIOD And by the way ,COMMA that thing can carry about <NUM> pounds of weight .PERIOD 
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you ,COMMA and i can they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing ,COMMA or how whales talk ,COMMA or how dogs talk .PERIOD And other types of tonal scales .PERIOD 
This is a group in germany ,COMMA that's beginning to engineer eyes .PERIOD So that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark .PERIOD 
Very primitive .PERIOD 
They'll do stuff you ,COMMA and i can't do .PERIOD 
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species .PERIOD 
Maybe not .PERIOD 
Once upon a time ,COMMA there was a dread disease that afflicted children .PERIOD 
And so as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him .PERIOD But building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure .PERIOD 
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds .PERIOD 
And the government ,COMMA they heard her story and the other people .PERIOD And they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA you're right .PERIOD We should make a law .PERIOD 
We would lose all of our market .PERIOD 
So many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data .PERIOD 
And then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash ,COMMA <NUM> <NUM> :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA different characteristics of the crash .PERIOD 
And the other thing you might argue is ,COMMA well ,COMMA car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD 
So they just have these bench seats .PERIOD And they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes ,COMMA that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD So he gets about a <NUM> out of -- you know ,COMMA on this range -- relative to a <NUM> ,COMMA and something .PERIOD 
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat .PERIOD 
It's in <NUM> days ,COMMA all this stuff has come .PERIOD 
There's two million emails per second .PERIOD 
It's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet .PERIOD 
And in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD 
And i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web .PERIOD 
They're going to talk to the machine .PERIOD 
Now with rfids and other things -- whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD The point ,COMMA is that everything will have embedded in it ,COMMA some sensor connecting it to the machine .PERIOD And so we have basically an internet of things .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information and the digital nature of things into the material world .PERIOD 
Attention is the currency .PERIOD 
And i'm saying humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring ,COMMA that what the web is doing is restructuring .PERIOD 
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information .PERIOD 
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line .PERIOD You had to share packets .PERIOD 
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages .PERIOD 
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody .PERIOD 
So the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent .PERIOD 
And what is happening with this is some kind of ai ,COMMA but it's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert .PERIOD Larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD And that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD 
But it'll anticipate what we're doing in a good sense .PERIOD 
And all these devices will be portals into that .PERIOD 
It was on jonestown .PERIOD 
The top picture is a group of moonies .PERIOD That have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD 
And so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK How does this work .PERIOD 
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .PERIOD 
We're beginning to look inside the brain .PERIOD 
And so if you looked at my brain or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA i am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD 
Because i have to say ,COMMA for my whole career ,COMMA if there's anything that's been consistent ,COMMA it's been that you can't do it .PERIOD 
It's calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line .PERIOD Not the straight line .PERIOD 
We make physical things ,COMMA buildings that become a part in an accretional process .PERIOD They make cities .PERIOD 
And i've had for <NUM> years ,COMMA an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear ,COMMA and to understand the nature of the final result of that ,COMMA representing the building itself .PERIOD 
This is a project that we just finished in penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .PERIOD 
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium ,COMMA that light becomes literally a building material .PERIOD 
This will be the first building in the united states that took -- well ,COMMA i can't say it took the air conditioning out ;SEMICOLON it's a hybrid .PERIOD 
And i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense .PERIOD 
What i'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .PERIOD 
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground .PERIOD And it becomes part of the idea .PERIOD 
And then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts ,COMMA geologic shifts right .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse .PERIOD 
Here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the renaissance .PERIOD 
It changed the way our history developed .PERIOD 
It is made for a diet which is soft ,COMMA mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable ,COMMA and digestible .PERIOD 
Sounds like fast food .PERIOD Doesn't it .PERIOD 
It's technology .PERIOD 
So this ingenuity of our ancestors ,COMMA to invent this most marvelous technology .PERIOD 
We populated all the ecologies .PERIOD 
It keeps also your brain working .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest .PERIOD 
Now having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage because you can actually influence your environment .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we have up to five tastes ,COMMA three of them sustain us .PERIOD 
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing ,COMMA because we know that in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form .PERIOD 
So satisfaction was a very important part .PERIOD 
If you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food .PERIOD Was not the right cooking manipulation ,COMMA or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD 
But what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk with the food .PERIOD The food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains .PERIOD 
This is the layer ,COMMA which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen .PERIOD 
What it means is that we have a layered control system .PERIOD 
So if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia .PERIOD 
This is fat .PERIOD Digestion .PERIOD 
Actually what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being .PERIOD When our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA homo erectus ,COMMA and infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world .PERIOD 
And the way clayton put it was this way .PERIOD 
I recently sailed on the hokulea ,COMMA named after the sacred star of hawaii throughout the south pacific ,COMMA to make a film ,COMMA about the navigators .PERIOD 
I spent <NUM> years living amongst the people of chinchero .PERIOD And i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in .PERIOD 
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses .PERIOD 
These ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization .PERIOD 
There are four societies .PERIOD The kogi the wiwa ,COMMA the kankwano and the arhuacos .PERIOD 
I traveled with the arhuacos .PERIOD And the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA danilo villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second .PERIOD 
We traveled high into the paramo ,COMMA and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape in terms of their own intense religiosity .PERIOD 
And we ran into a farc patrol at dawn .PERIOD So it was quite harrowing .PERIOD 
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers .PERIOD They cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth .PERIOD 
And when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with <NUM> ,COMMA different voices .PERIOD 
They are unique answers to that fundamental question :COLON what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA you're living through a time .PERIOD When virtually half of humanity's intellectual ,COMMA social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away .PERIOD 
This does not have to happen .PERIOD 
So i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years .PERIOD 
This is crazy .PERIOD 
If you're in northern europe or north america ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls .PERIOD 
Because the manufacturing process is our organism .PERIOD 
They're not going to clog up earth's ecosystems .PERIOD They work ,COMMA great .PERIOD 
My brief ,COMMA as you've just heard ,COMMA is to tell you about statistics -- and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics .PERIOD 
Don't tell her .PERIOD I said ,COMMA that .PERIOD 
She paused and said ,COMMA he models things .PERIOD 
The next time after the 15th toss .PERIOD 
That's what i want this side to think about .PERIOD 
Either they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that .PERIOD One .PERIOD 
Who thinks that c is true -- that ,COMMA on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail .PERIOD 
The champagne's on ice ;SEMICOLON just next to you .PERIOD You've got the glasses chilled to celebrate .PERIOD 
And if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD 
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence .PERIOD 
If it's a head you're disappointed ,COMMA but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD 
This is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics .PERIOD 
When you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails .PERIOD 
And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology .PERIOD 
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques .PERIOD 
It's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD 
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals .PERIOD 
Those of you in britain will know about what's become ,COMMA rather ,COMMA a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark ,COMMA who had two babies ,COMMA who died suddenly .PERIOD 
And to argue ,COMMA then that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD 
One of them is that sally clark was innocent -- which is ,COMMA a priori ,COMMA overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don't kill their children .PERIOD 
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this .PERIOD 
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .PERIOD 
All of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing ,COMMA is underpinned by statistics .PERIOD 
This is a world-changing invention .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring .PERIOD 
Hmmm .PERIOD 
So far we've applied for <NUM> patent claims .PERIOD 
So to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can ,COMMA globally ,COMMA save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries ,COMMA and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage .PERIOD Every single year .PERIOD While significantly reducing global energy consumption .PERIOD 
In the spirit of this year's ted conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful :COLON world-changing invention .PERIOD 
And that's what i'd like to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD 
It's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy .PERIOD In the air that tickle our eardrum .PERIOD 
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing .PERIOD 
And as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA play that .PERIOD Video :COLON please .PERIOD 
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing ,COMMA will not have to face .PERIOD 
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA literally ,COMMA they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in .PERIOD 
Language is very different .PERIOD Language is very precise .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity .PERIOD 
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended .PERIOD 
What that suggests is that ,COMMA even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains .PERIOD 
And here's a video of joseph .PERIOD 
Joseph ,COMMA i was born in <NUM> .PERIOD 
When i was <NUM> years old ,COMMA i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation .PERIOD 
And this is really unheard of stuff .PERIOD And this is all because of this technology .PERIOD 
You don't actually have to hear it .PERIOD 
I know he doesn't hear well because i've heard him do karaoke .PERIOD 
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us .PERIOD 
And so i'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD That's what happens in proteins .PERIOD 
When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms ,COMMA these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA here's a shape .PERIOD I actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coding ,COMMA like ,COMMA linus [torvalds] in that picture before .PERIOD 
I mix them together ,COMMA add a little bit of salt water ,COMMA and then add this long strand i was telling you about ,COMMA that i've stolen from a virus .PERIOD And then what happens is you heat this whole thing up to about boiling you cool it down to room temperature .PERIOD And as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands .PERIOD They do the following thing ,COMMA each one of them binds that long strand in one place ,COMMA and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place .PERIOD And brings those two parts of the long strand close together ,COMMA so that they stick together .PERIOD 
You can make a molecule that looks like this .PERIOD And you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
So that's dna origami .PERIOD That's one way .PERIOD There are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna .PERIOD 
I did not choose to take up the pen ,COMMA the brush ,COMMA the camera .PERIOD 
Why did i choose the gun as my instrument .PERIOD 
My father was a hardworking baker ,COMMA but when he had finished work in the bakery ,COMMA he often told me and my brother stories .PERIOD 
My father was there to provide it .PERIOD 
He fired ,COMMA nothing happened .PERIOD

Why has violence decreased .PERIOD 
Or is there something else .PERIOD 
The armed forces .PERIOD Implement the state monopoly on violence .PERIOD 
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .PERIOD 
And that is why ?QUESTIONMARK -- and in the netherlands ,COMMA we are very unique in that -- that is why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD 
And i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .PERIOD 
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home .PERIOD And when they are injured and need our care .PERIOD 
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .PERIOD 
Women are much more in balance because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do <NUM> pull-ups .PERIOD 
They think about how to get the weight over their feet ,COMMA because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .PERIOD 
It took us <NUM> years to sequence hiv -- we sequenced sars in <NUM> days .PERIOD 
If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph ,COMMA television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened .PERIOD But some observer says ,COMMA well kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD You have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements .PERIOD What the key points are there's differences of opinion when agriculture started .PERIOD Or how long the cambrian explosion took .PERIOD 
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in <NUM> ,COMMA two years in the middle .PERIOD We're now doubling it every one year .PERIOD 
Supercomputers -- same thing .PERIOD 
You would think it would be a very erratic process ,COMMA and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .PERIOD 
As we make them smaller and less expensive ,COMMA the electrons have less distance to travel .PERIOD 
And economists have actually started worrying about that .PERIOD 
This is due to greater productivity ,COMMA but the economist says ,COMMA but there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that .PERIOD 
These were evolved in very different times -- we'd like to actually change those programs .PERIOD 
We'd like to actually turn that program off .PERIOD 
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would be interesting drug for the human market ,COMMA and that's just one of the <NUM> genes that affect our biochemistry .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with rna interference .PERIOD 
It's now under a 10th of a cent .PERIOD 
Once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating .PERIOD We can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .PERIOD 
Where will we get the software .PERIOD 
Wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was .PERIOD But then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well ,COMMA that was wrong .PERIOD And then we had this bust .PERIOD 
Images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD We'll be interacting with virtual personalities .PERIOD 
You can go there with other people ,COMMA have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .PERIOD 
But most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which ,COMMA in some sense we're doing already .PERIOD 
It's just like this one ,COMMA completely worthless ,COMMA in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good .PERIOD But it does absolutely nothing .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said ,COMMA they were okay ,COMMA actually cost lives .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .PERIOD 
And that's called superstition .PERIOD And that i'm afraid ,COMMA we will always have with us .PERIOD 
You are a hominid three million years ago walking on the plains of africa .PERIOD

Every time somebody looks at you ,COMMA you think people are staring at you .PERIOD 
Because the lights on here .PERIOD 
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is ,COMMA of course the dolphins right .PERIOD 
That's a dolphin tail there .PERIOD Guys .PERIOD 
So you recognize obama immediately .PERIOD 
And this is also ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the basis of conspiracy theories .PERIOD 
Explains a lot ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that's a whole other lecture .PERIOD 
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe .PERIOD You can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences ,COMMA near-death experiences ,COMMA which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe .PERIOD There .PERIOD 
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience .PERIOD 
It ties together all this into the power of expectation ,COMMA and the power of belief .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA now i'm going to ask you to pucker up .PERIOD 
Pucker up ,COMMA big and lean in just a little bit .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
Jennifer ,COMMA the man came and started undressing me .PERIOD

Witness .PERIOD 
There could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground ,COMMA reaching for the light and growing strong ,COMMA just like a tree .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
So in that <NUM> minutes or <NUM> minutes or five minutes ,COMMA you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics .PERIOD 
Next up is knowledge .PERIOD 
You walk in the door .PERIOD So the first thing you've got to do -- the overall ,COMMA you know ,COMMA arc of your presentation -- it's got to start like a rocket .PERIOD 
And everything has got to be reinforcing this .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA logical progression .PERIOD 
You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones .PERIOD 
You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .PERIOD 
So this all feeds in together .PERIOD 
You want absolute -- this is the zen of presentation ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So with that said ,COMMA we only have a very ,COMMA very short time .PERIOD 
You do that ,COMMA you give me your quick 15-second or 30-second intro ,COMMA grab my attention .PERIOD 
We build widgets for the x ,COMMA y z market .PERIOD 
If it's a website ,COMMA show me a screenshot of your website .PERIOD

Powerpoint ,COMMA has this built into every copy of powerpoint ?QUESTIONMARK That's shipped .PERIOD 
And the number one presentation tip :COLON never ever look at the screen .PERIOD 
And that is how to pitch to a vc .PERIOD 
I'm here today to start a revolution .PERIOD 
Now before you get up in arms ,COMMA or you break into song ,COMMA or you pick a favorite color ,COMMA i want to define what i mean by revolution .PERIOD 
We're last place in health care ,COMMA and that's important for a sense of well-being .PERIOD 
That's social .PERIOD Let's look at education .PERIOD 
Because it's shown the way we apply generate ,COMMA and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context ,COMMA which told us what ,COMMA in communism .PERIOD

And it's not just kids ,COMMA it's adults ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
These guys are facts .PERIOD 
The opposite of play is not work .PERIOD 
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals .PERIOD There's benefits for play at work .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the professional athlete that loves skiing .PERIOD He's serious about it ,COMMA but he loves it .PERIOD 
A doctor might be serious .PERIOD But laughter's still a great medicine .PERIOD 
You guys have to ,COMMA and if you're not feeling it ,COMMA your colleagues ,COMMA your employees aren't going to feel it .PERIOD 
Fear is the enemy of play .PERIOD 
Let them take long lunches .PERIOD 
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD 
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD 
What we need is a players' uprising .PERIOD 
And i am illustrating still .PERIOD 
Which ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i am not agreeing with because although i am <NUM> .PERIOD I am not still working .PERIOD 
I still have -- or did i use the word still ?QUESTIONMARK I didn't mean that .PERIOD 
These were just some of the things i've made .PERIOD 
These are tiles .PERIOD The word ,COMMA playful is a necessary aspect of our work ,COMMA because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA one of our problems is that we have to make produce lovely things throughout all of life .PERIOD And this for me ,COMMA is now <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So how can you without drying up ,COMMA make things with the same pleasure ,COMMA as a gift to others for so long .PERIOD 
I started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman ,COMMA and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages .PERIOD 
We mashed the clay with our feet .PERIOD When it came from the hillside .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully ,COMMA that i had behaved morally ,COMMA and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers .PERIOD Rail-diggers oven-setters chimney .PERIOD Sweeps and potters .PERIOD 
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions .PERIOD And i still have that workbook .PERIOD 
My mother thought that this was not very proper ,COMMA so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the director ,COMMA the chemist ,COMMA model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself ,COMMA much more with the art department -- that means with my work -- than making toilets .PERIOD So finally ,COMMA they got a letter from the center ,COMMA from the bank who owned the factory ,COMMA saying ,COMMA make toilet-setting behind the art department .PERIOD And that was my end .PERIOD 
So i will try speed it up a little .PERIOD Moderator :COLON eva we have about five minutes .PERIOD 
The accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin's life .PERIOD 
But since i survived and i'm here ,COMMA and since this is the end of the five minutes ,COMMA i will -- moderator :COLON tell me ,COMMA when your last trip to russia was .PERIOD 
Oh this summer ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company invited me .PERIOD 
That's my camera lens .PERIOD The first one -- the one i shot my bob dylan film with <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
I called my sister .PERIOD I called my neighbors .PERIOD I said ,COMMA come dig .PERIOD 
That's my sister .PERIOD She took care of pictures because i was a big collector of snapshot photography that i believed said a lot .PERIOD 
She's still there .PERIOD She's there this morning ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this .PERIOD 
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful ,COMMA beautiful child .PERIOD And i remember ,COMMA as she was ,COMMA approaching me ,COMMA the voices of friends saying ,COMMA the moment they put the baby in your hands ,COMMA you will feel a sense of love that will come over you .PERIOD That is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life .PERIOD 
And it was also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA surreal .PERIOD 
You're either in love or you're not in love .PERIOD 
I enjoyed being pregnant .PERIOD I loved it .PERIOD 
Of those <NUM> percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two .PERIOD 
In the process of preparing this ,COMMA we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time .PERIOD Because here in the western world ,COMMA less than <NUM> percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which i think is part of why .PERIOD This is such a tough period .PERIOD 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .PERIOD 
As you get older ,COMMA you become more stable .PERIOD 
You start to realize that hey ,COMMA i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience .PERIOD That will cover my entire body with goosebumps ,COMMA but it's more likely that i'll feel claustrophobic .PERIOD And i won't be able to get a beer .PERIOD 
So your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments .PERIOD 
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD 
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .PERIOD 
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this .PERIOD 
There's another factor ,COMMA in our case .PERIOD 
And we had reservations about this on the front end .PERIOD 
Get out of the airplane .PERIOD It turns out you're trekking in nepal .PERIOD 
Rg + av :COLON thank you .PERIOD 
We crave to be in the room with the musician .PERIOD The day it was recorded the day it was played .PERIOD 
And we go to live concerts ,COMMA and we get that as much as we can .PERIOD 
And yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there .PERIOD 
He just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like -- a performing monkey was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA his term .PERIOD 
His maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations .PERIOD 
He wrote some early pieces ,COMMA but late in his life in his mature period ,COMMA he said ,COMMA here's a theme -- <NUM> variations .PERIOD 
And gould :COLON recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono and one in stereo .PERIOD 
What i'd like you to hear live is the <NUM> version ,COMMA and we'll play the first couple pieces of it .PERIOD 
So in the video world ,COMMA we've been able to invent in our lifetimes ,COMMA natural behavior .PERIOD 
And when you put on headphones ,COMMA and you listen to this ,COMMA you're inside of glenn gould's body .PERIOD 
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
You want to hear it in different rooms ,COMMA and whatever .PERIOD 
We made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september .PERIOD 
And fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here .PERIOD 
I want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from .PERIOD 
I trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy .PERIOD 
And although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else .PERIOD 
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity .PERIOD But that growth hasn't always delivered .PERIOD What we needed .PERIOD 
Rates of depression carried on up right across the western world .PERIOD 
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream .PERIOD 
Ronald reagan again ,COMMA said ,COMMA the two funniest sentences in the english language are ,COMMA i'm from the government .PERIOD And i'm here to help .PERIOD 
And i think more and more people are also asking why boost consumption ,COMMA rather than change what we consume .PERIOD 
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago .PERIOD Maybe they are .PERIOD But they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did .PERIOD 
And he believed we live with others .PERIOD We share the world with others ,COMMA and therefore our innovation must be done with others ,COMMA too ,COMMA not doing things at people for them .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
Others are much more pragmatic :COLON health coaches ,COMMA learning mentors ,COMMA job clubs .PERIOD 
Now the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is rapidly becoming a common sense ,COMMA and part of how we respond to the crisis ,COMMA recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress as well as technological progress .PERIOD 
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country ,COMMA as well as a public service innovation lab .PERIOD 
And if a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon ,COMMA perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition ,COMMA stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA i think closer to home for america or europe .PERIOD Why don't we set ourselves the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA those are all goals ,COMMA which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment not just with technologies .PERIOD But also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .PERIOD 
History was over and society ,COMMA would inevitably have to take second place to economy .PERIOD 
Just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
You think i've lost my way ,COMMA and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me gently back to my seat .PERIOD 
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi .PERIOD 
And one fine day ,COMMA she decided to take them into the garden to teach them some nature vocabulary .PERIOD 
A language dies every <NUM> days .PERIOD 
That is a little bit too early .PERIOD 
We were brought to teach english ,COMMA because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education .PERIOD 
But if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test .PERIOD 
Do we really want to end up with <NUM> languages ?QUESTIONMARK And the main one being english or chinese .PERIOD 
And i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english .PERIOD They didn't have to pass an english test .PERIOD 
Let me tell you a story about two scientists :COLON two english ,COMMA scientists .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he invented a cost-free solar lamp .PERIOD 
When he received his award ,COMMA he said ,COMMA these lovely words the children can lead africa from what it is today .PERIOD A dark continent to a light continent .PERIOD 
I am known best for human-powered flight ,COMMA but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it ,COMMA and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power ,COMMA and maybe help that field .PERIOD 
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals .PERIOD And we can do things much more efficiently .PERIOD 
So this just summarizes it .PERIOD Over billions of years ,COMMA on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile .PERIOD 
Suddenly we humans .PERIOD A recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD We now wield the paintbrush .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA and let's have the next .PERIOD 
And then also like it said in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA that's it ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA just a few inventions .PERIOD 
Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something :COLON they are experts ,COMMA they know what's going on .PERIOD 
All of you know about the topic that i'm supposed to talk about .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee .PERIOD 
And the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which ,COMMA in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it ,COMMA by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD 
It's like ,COMMA what is simplicity .PERIOD 
What is the state of science .PERIOD 
And interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved .PERIOD 
One of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party ,COMMA and have a conversation .PERIOD 
And the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things .PERIOD 
And that's complexity .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind .PERIOD 
The question is :COLON why is binary simpler than arabic .PERIOD 
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA you can stack them .PERIOD 
And you put a drop .PERIOD In this case of urine at the bottom .PERIOD 
It turns colors ,COMMA in this particular case ,COMMA you're reading kidney function .PERIOD 
If you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD 
So you can't make it too simple .PERIOD 
And the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement .PERIOD 
So what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover brancusi .PERIOD It doesn't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh and certainly doesn't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach .PERIOD 
You've got a company set up to .PERIOD 
I want to open by quoting einstein's wonderful statement .PERIOD Just .PERIOD So people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us ,COMMA and also calls us to this action .PERIOD 
I know the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven -- that's maitreya -- so i'm going to go on a retreat ,COMMA and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me ,COMMA and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion .PERIOD In the world today .PERIOD 
And the man said ,COMMA really ,COMMA and he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD 
So he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i get the point .PERIOD 
He went back to his cave .PERIOD He meditated again .PERIOD 
Another three years ,COMMA no ,COMMA vision .PERIOD He leaves ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
So he thought ,COMMA i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds .PERIOD And then i'll figure out what to do with the maggots .PERIOD 
So he starts to do that ,COMMA he can't grab the maggots .PERIOD 
He jumps back ,COMMA and there ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights ,COMMA golden ,COMMA jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .PERIOD 
So as he comes up from his first bow ,COMMA he says ,COMMA my lord !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm so happy to see you .PERIOD But where have you been for ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And maitreya says ,COMMA i was with you ,COMMA who do you ?QUESTIONMARK Think ,COMMA was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you ,COMMA mister dense .PERIOD 
Looking for the buddha in person .PERIOD He said .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town .PERIOD 
You gave me that expression .PERIOD The eternal mama .PERIOD You said ,COMMA that's wonderful .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they first create this foundation of equality .PERIOD 
And we don't hate anyone ,COMMA therefore .PERIOD So we equalize that's very important .PERIOD 
And this is the way you do it .PERIOD You take any being who looks weird to you ,COMMA and you see how they could be familiar to you .PERIOD 
You ;SEMICOLON reduce ;SEMICOLON the feeling of otherness about beings .PERIOD 
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .PERIOD 
And they then never get any positive feedback .PERIOD 
Compassion ,COMMA makes you happy .PERIOD 
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else .PERIOD 
Because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r&ampd lab ,COMMA where they were thinking up new projects .PERIOD And it came out of there ,COMMA it didn't come from there .PERIOD 
The ideas are coming back from the consumers .PERIOD And they're often ahead of the producers .PERIOD 
The very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west ,COMMA end theaters .PERIOD 
More and more the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance .PERIOD 
The second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations .PERIOD 
Take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which yochai has already mentioned .PERIOD 
What does this mean ,COMMA then ,COMMA for our organizational landscape .PERIOD 
Let me just give you two examples .PERIOD 
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft outlook .PERIOD No one .PERIOD 
Because the professionals ,COMMA over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics .PERIOD They might be programmers ;SEMICOLON they might be doctors ;SEMICOLON they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no -- you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD 
They want to as jimmy said ,COMMA they want to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation .PERIOD 
What should be the role of public policy .PERIOD 
And i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan .PERIOD 
Didn't go into the internet ,COMMA kept his money ,COMMA decided to go into computer games .PERIOD 
At any one time there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD 
How many people does he employ to service that population .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA how can he service ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> million people from <NUM> employees .PERIOD 
Imagine you could take all the children in education in britain ,COMMA and one percent of them were co-developers of education .PERIOD 
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .PERIOD 
And i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD 
And so i said ,COMMA let's put this together in an album .PERIOD 
We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier .PERIOD But ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person .PERIOD 
Recording ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here's something .PERIOD 
But sometimes i feel really lonely .PERIOD 
Like even people in convenience stores saying have a nice day ,COMMA when they're accidentally looking me in the eye .PERIOD 
And i got a lot like <NUM> in a half an hour .PERIOD 
I was like i don't know .PERIOD 
But anyway ,COMMA this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD 
So i asked her ,COMMA what does it feel like when you feel this way .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll think about it .PERIOD 
And when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens .PERIOD And all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world .PERIOD 
And over the past <NUM> years ,COMMA i've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters ,COMMA dopamine ,COMMA things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis .PERIOD 
It's really a very precisely timed thing .PERIOD 
So there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
A key thing is that the major violence genes .PERIOD It's called the mao-a gene .PERIOD 
It's on the x chromosome .PERIOD And so in this way you can only get it from your mother .PERIOD 
And what i think might happen in these areas of the world ,COMMA where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD 
Now i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so what we have lizzie .PERIOD 
But it doesn't stop there .PERIOD 
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere .PERIOD 
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .PERIOD 
So you might be asking ,COMMA why .PERIOD 
Absolutely everything .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like <NUM> billion neutrinos per second from the sun ,COMMA passing through every square centimeter of your body .PERIOD 
And these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD 
One of the wonderful things actually ,COMMA i find ,COMMA is that we've discovered any of them when you realize ,COMMA how tiny they are .PERIOD 
So one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ,COMMA ernest rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus ,COMMA once said ,COMMA all science is either physics or stamp collecting .PERIOD 
Now i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from new zealand ,COMMA so it's possible .PERIOD 
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room .PERIOD 
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy in a sense and massive because they're surrounded by higgs particles .PERIOD 
This is a creation story .PERIOD I think ,COMMA equally as wonderful .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's the lhc .PERIOD 
When i grew up and realized ,COMMA that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers ,COMMA i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science ,COMMA to find a more useful truth .PERIOD 
By measuring their student smiles ,COMMA researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be .PERIOD How well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .PERIOD 
Outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile more than <NUM> times per day .PERIOD Whereas less than <NUM> percent of us smile less than five .PERIOD 
The finding supported darwin's theory ,COMMA by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better .PERIOD When we smile .PERIOD 
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD 
The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing ,COMMA and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD 
If you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA kibera is represented as a lush ,COMMA green national park devoid of human settlement .PERIOD 
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software .PERIOD Strategists .PERIOD 
But if you're like me my humanity is more like a window .PERIOD 
Then suddenly i see it ,COMMA and usually it's never good .PERIOD 
My mother was english .PERIOD 
She was five foot ,COMMA two ,COMMA very feisty and very english .PERIOD 
This is how english my mother is -- or was ,COMMA she just passed .PERIOD 
And then we went to a fish restaurant and we had chad ,COMMA the surfer dude ,COMMA serving us ,COMMA and he came up ,COMMA and my mother said ,COMMA do you have any specials ,COMMA young man ?QUESTIONMARK 
And my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA what language is he speaking .PERIOD 
But her igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD 
So here are these women who never discuss their period with their husbands .PERIOD And here i am telling them ,COMMA well how often do you get your period .PERIOD 
It was my mother with five little children .PERIOD 
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman ,COMMA standing up to men with guns who want to kill us .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror .PERIOD 
And then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born .PERIOD 
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men .PERIOD 
Their humanity ,COMMA never seems to matter very much to us .PERIOD 
And a lot of rituals involved killing ,COMMA killing little animals ,COMMA progressing along .PERIOD So ,COMMA when i turned <NUM> -- and i mean ,COMMA it made sense ;SEMICOLON it was an agrarian community ,COMMA somebody had to kill the animals .PERIOD There was no whole foods .PERIOD You could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when i turned <NUM> ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD 
Now when i was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running .PERIOD 
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back .PERIOD So he summoned me up and he said ,COMMA go into the bedroom .PERIOD My bedroom .PERIOD 
That's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD 
So one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot naturally becomes agile .PERIOD 
It's inversely proportional to r .PERIOD 
No matter how you throw it .PERIOD The robot recovers ,COMMA and comes back to him .PERIOD 
So here are robots carrying beams ,COMMA columns and assembling cube-like structures .PERIOD 
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .PERIOD 
So we use a little trick .PERIOD 
They sense their neighbors .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands <NUM> times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands <NUM> times a second .PERIOD 
As you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation .PERIOD 
Another application :COLON i want to show you -- again .PERIOD This is in our lab .PERIOD 
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots ,COMMA how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD 
So all these experiments you've seen thus far ,COMMA all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems .PERIOD 
It figures out where it is with respect to the features and then estimates its position <NUM> times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier .PERIOD 
You will see ,COMMA nine robots play six different instruments .PERIOD 
Let's watch .PERIOD 
Unless you're on one of these californian low-carb diets ,COMMA bread is standard .PERIOD 
And i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD 
And this is about good taste ,COMMA good traditions .PERIOD 
But we have somehow in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical ,COMMA rural agricultural past .PERIOD 
So what is happening .PERIOD 
Bread has migrated to tropical countries ,COMMA where ,COMMA the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .PERIOD 
This is where it all comes from ,COMMA and where these farmers who ,COMMA actually ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread .PERIOD 
Let's go back to traditional farming .PERIOD 
And i'm making a real plea here .PERIOD 
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control .PERIOD 
What i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there ,COMMA but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields .PERIOD But in terms of the entire food network .PERIOD 
So what kind of science can we have .PERIOD 
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .PERIOD 
Everything is linked together .PERIOD 
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .PERIOD 
And as you eat it ,COMMA and as you try it -- please come and stand up .PERIOD 
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA i think ,COMMA evolutionarily-speaking is unique .PERIOD 
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water .PERIOD 
This crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost <NUM> feet long in the northern rivers ,COMMA and this charismatic snake ,COMMA the king cobra .PERIOD 
And it really works to start with them .PERIOD 
The people of this part of india ,COMMA worship the king cobra .PERIOD 
It's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity .PERIOD 
And now the king cobra is a new one .PERIOD 
It survived ,COMMA even during the time that the dinosaurs died off .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma .PERIOD 
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this .PERIOD 
This was actually just taken last year .PERIOD 
My pals in the crocodile specialist group ,COMMA of the iucn ,COMMA the [madras crocodile bank] ,COMMA an ngo ,COMMA the world wildlife fund ,COMMA the wildlife institute of india ,COMMA state forest departments and the ministry of environment .PERIOD We all work together on stuff .PERIOD 
So it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain ,COMMA something in the fish .PERIOD They were eating .PERIOD 
But poolan devi was one [of them] ,COMMA which actually shekhar kapur made an incredible movie the bandit queen ,COMMA which i urge you to see .PERIOD 
So who is next us .PERIOD 
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there .PERIOD 
So we can do it .PERIOD 
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD 
Namaste .PERIOD 
I look at it as a creature .PERIOD Who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being .PERIOD 
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before .PERIOD 
And the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from maharashtra .PERIOD He said ,COMMA i think he's after the nusha .PERIOD 
Whenever he eats the pit viper ,COMMA he gets this little venom rush .PERIOD 
To me ,COMMA that’s the real natural wonder .PERIOD 
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost <NUM> dollars per patient .PERIOD And medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for <NUM> people to go through the program on the sites that we train .PERIOD 
And i’ll talk more about this ,COMMA but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression .PERIOD 
And the pain is not the problem ;SEMICOLON it’s the symptom .PERIOD 
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago .PERIOD 
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent .PERIOD And that’s not much fun .PERIOD 
Your sexual function improves .PERIOD 
When you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel .PERIOD 
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards .PERIOD 
These are not election returns .PERIOD These are the percentage of people who are overweight .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA i’ve got some good news .PERIOD 
What we found was that after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment .PERIOD Whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation .PERIOD 
And then i wondered ,COMMA was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes ,COMMA in psa .PERIOD 
The last thing i want to talk about ,COMMA apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness ,COMMA is that study .PERIOD After study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely .PERIOD In part because ,COMMA as we talked about ,COMMA they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
It can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .PERIOD 
And at the end of it ,COMMA somebody said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA swami ,COMMA what’s the difference between wellness and illness .PERIOD 
And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word illness ,COMMA and circled the first letter ,COMMA and then wrote the word wellness .PERIOD And circled the first two letters .PERIOD 
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer ,COMMA visualization .PERIOD 
Hopefully it won't stutter .PERIOD 
And if we did our jobs ,COMMA well ,COMMA you won't know that we were even involved .PERIOD 
Some you could see some ,COMMA you couldn't .PERIOD 
Now there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor's body .PERIOD 
Now .PERIOD Fincher is an interesting guy .PERIOD 
And so david had an interesting take on the film ,COMMA and he threw a challenge at us .PERIOD 
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david and we ruled out ,COMMA of course ,COMMA swapping actors .PERIOD 
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts .PERIOD 
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA the first step is admit you've got a problem .PERIOD 
So we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything .PERIOD A human being can do .PERIOD 
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in <NUM> and where we needed it to be .PERIOD 
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture .PERIOD 
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking .PERIOD And that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process .PERIOD 
We needed the subtleties of the skin .PERIOD 
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles .PERIOD And all of those things .PERIOD 
So clearly ,COMMA we were in a substantially ,COMMA better place for this .PERIOD 
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count .PERIOD 
This was the breakthrough .PERIOD 
This is brad doing one of the ekman ,COMMA facs poses .PERIOD 
We shot him with four hd cameras ,COMMA so we'd get multiple views of him .PERIOD And then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast .PERIOD 
And here you can see the body actor .PERIOD 
We also had to create an eye system .PERIOD 
He was very popular .PERIOD 
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior ,COMMA or enhance his performance .PERIOD 
So as things went through this process ,COMMA fincher would always say it sandblasts the edges off of the performance .PERIOD 
So it sees a smile as a smile .PERIOD 
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture ,COMMA as opposed to just motion capture .PERIOD 
Their :COLON teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .PERIOD 
And we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here is some seed fund .PERIOD 
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society .PERIOD So we were able to address that .PERIOD 
We rescued over <NUM> dancing bears .PERIOD 
Now the end product of that action is up on the board here .PERIOD 
When i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about ,COMMA i had recently come back from jordan ,COMMA where i had an amazing experience with a camel .PERIOD 
The guys got out ,COMMA they put the hood up .PERIOD They started working under the hood .PERIOD Got it going again about a hundred yards .PERIOD It broke down .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA ah ,COMMA no problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK We just get out and walk .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we'll walk .PERIOD We'll find some camels .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we'll need to be very careful around him .PERIOD Don't let him get you .PERIOD 
When they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way ,COMMA like a seal ,COMMA has to open its nose to breathe .PERIOD 
They use them to pinpoint sound .PERIOD 
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold .PERIOD 
But they use their tails a lot ,COMMA especially in rut .PERIOD 
But on this particular occasion ,COMMA it was very ,COMMA very clear that as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it .PERIOD 
So i'm going to show you another film .PERIOD 
But before i do ,COMMA i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand .PERIOD The ship of the desert .PERIOD It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely mongolia and sahara -- that there are <NUM> words in arabic ,COMMA to describe the camel .PERIOD 
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee ,COMMA it's certainly been like no committee i've ever been on .PERIOD 
So here's what suki would do in search of a mate .PERIOD 
I'm ted camel .PERIOD 
I'm smartly designed .PERIOD 
A distinguished nose ,COMMA with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust ,COMMA and a groove that catches moisture .PERIOD 
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat .PERIOD 
I'm able to lose <NUM> percent of my weight without dying .PERIOD 
Humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures .PERIOD Because ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA we really don't have to adapt to our environment .PERIOD We adapt our environment to us .PERIOD 
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts ,COMMA and keeps adapting and adapting .PERIOD 
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems ,COMMA and then they would find animators to animate them .PERIOD 
Writing is not actually as easy as that .PERIOD For me .PERIOD 
Poetry just says a few things in different ways .PERIOD 
Some days i put the people in their places at the table ,COMMA bend their legs at the knees ,COMMA if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny .PERIOD Wooden chairs .PERIOD 
The name of the author is the first to go ,COMMA followed obediently by the title .PERIOD The plot ,COMMA the heartbreaking conclusion .PERIOD The entire novel ,COMMA which suddenly becomes one .PERIOD You have never read .PERIOD Never even heard of .PERIOD 
It's called the country .PERIOD 
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife ,COMMA having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified .PERIOD 
If it has a subject ,COMMA the subject is adolescence .PERIOD 
Frankly ,COMMA who cares if annie ?QUESTIONMARK Oakley ?QUESTIONMARK Was a crack shot at <NUM> or if maria callas debuted as tosca at <NUM> .PERIOD 
And here comes a second follower .PERIOD 
Now it's not a lone nut ,COMMA it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd ,COMMA and a crowd is news .PERIOD 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .PERIOD 
I wrote the book on a treadmill ,COMMA and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .PERIOD 
I also tried to be the safest person i could be ,COMMA because that's a part of health .PERIOD 
Now it's a little extreme .PERIOD I admit .PERIOD 
But if you think about this ,COMMA this is actually -- the freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .PERIOD 
Without the sex part .PERIOD 
And i finally have stabilized .PERIOD 
And i ,COMMA of course ,COMMA don't have time to go into all of them .PERIOD 
It really impairs cognition .PERIOD 
So without noise reduction technology ,COMMA our country would not exist .PERIOD 
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking .PERIOD You're eating doritos .PERIOD 
That's my greatest hope .PERIOD 
What might they find .PERIOD 
Here's a replica of one such seal .PERIOD 
We need to decipher the script to answer that question .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .PERIOD 
If you look at a map of india today ,COMMA you'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to .PERIOD The indo-european language family .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA there's no rosetta stone .PERIOD 
And furthermore ,COMMA we don't even know what language they spoke .PERIOD 
And to make matters even worse .PERIOD Most of the text that we have are extremely short .PERIOD 
And why was i fascinated .PERIOD 
And i'd like to describe some of the results that we have found .PERIOD 
I'll give you a couple of seconds .PERIOD 
Languages contain patterns .PERIOD 
Language .PERIOD On the other hand ,COMMA has an intermediate level of entropy .PERIOD It's neither too rigid .PERIOD Nor is it too .PERIOD Random .PERIOD 
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .PERIOD 
We found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .PERIOD 
Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession .PERIOD 
So as the old saying goes ,COMMA if it looks like a linguistic script ,COMMA and it acts like a linguistic script ,COMMA then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands .PERIOD 
So as an example ,COMMA here's a word .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA great .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is just like a crossword puzzle ,COMMA except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles ,COMMA because the stakes are so high if you solve it .PERIOD 
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign .PERIOD 
And it turns out that in india there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA there's another sequence of six stars .PERIOD And that translates to aru meen ,COMMA which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades .PERIOD 
So that was pretty exciting .PERIOD 
But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space ,COMMA we have no sense of what space sounds like .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft ,COMMA but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact ,COMMA the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today ,COMMA the telephone .PERIOD 
Thomas :COLON watson :COLON spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected .PERIOD 
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .PERIOD 
There was a glitch in their soundtrack .PERIOD 
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .PERIOD 
Because our egocentric perception -- from the buddha's point of view ,COMMA misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin .PERIOD 
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception ,COMMA a little bit right .PERIOD 
Like even when you're having a good time ,COMMA when is the good time over .PERIOD 
I think the dalai lama should have heard that ,COMMA i wish he'd been there to hear that .PERIOD 
Everybody has the wrong idea .PERIOD They think buddha was so boring .PERIOD And they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama ,COMMA and he's fairly jolly .PERIOD 
The human being is almost out of time .PERIOD 
This is birhan ,COMMA who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s .PERIOD <NUM> minutes away from death when she was rescued ,COMMA and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .PERIOD 
And what do all these pictures and events have in common .PERIOD 
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .PERIOD 
What we see unlocks :COLON the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .PERIOD 
Go back <NUM> years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce ,COMMA and all the protesters .PERIOD 
They won public opinion over a long period of time .PERIOD 
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds .PERIOD 
I was with nelson mandela a year ago when he was in london .PERIOD 
I have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .PERIOD 
I met her in a field .PERIOD She was ragged .PERIOD She had no shoes .PERIOD 
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries ,COMMA based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture .PERIOD So that africa is not a net importer of food ,COMMA but an exporter of food .PERIOD 
Making people laugh .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA please send me your ideas about how to design a foot .PERIOD 
We have to first know what a foot is .PERIOD 
And i want you to help me do that in this next clip .PERIOD 
See ?QUESTIONMARK Any common themes ?QUESTIONMARK Principles .PERIOD 
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere .PERIOD 
If you want to study how a foot works ,COMMA we're going to have to simulate those surfaces or simulate that debris .PERIOD 
Without a foot ,COMMA here's what it does .PERIOD It doesn't even slow down .PERIOD 
That's a bipedal octopus .PERIOD That's disguised as a rolling coconut .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you might have noticed something else about the animals .PERIOD When they were running over the rough terrain .PERIOD 
Boy ,COMMA spiny .PERIOD 
Do we really understand that principle of tuning ?QUESTIONMARK The answer is yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
But look at this animal ,COMMA do it .PERIOD 
And you probably feel them .PERIOD If you grabbed it .PERIOD 
These are all from different insects .PERIOD 
Let's look at that ant .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA what happens .PERIOD 
So to our blueprint ,COMMA we stick on some sticky pads .PERIOD 
These are its feet .PERIOD 
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends ,COMMA and that's the secret ,COMMA because it allows intimate contact .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA you are pulling off the band-aid .PERIOD 
Here's the new project :COLON we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces .PERIOD 
And here it is coming up at you in its first steps up a wall .PERIOD 
And that's exactly what he's done .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals ,COMMA whose world was so foreign to me ,COMMA was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human .PERIOD Sounds .PERIOD 
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle ,COMMA a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin .PERIOD It's done the right thing ,COMMA and can come get a fish .PERIOD 
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart .PERIOD 
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle ,COMMA against the maximum distance .PERIOD 
So when dolphins are separating by less than <NUM> ,COMMA meters ,COMMA less than half the time they need to use whistles .PERIOD 
Most of the time they can just find each other ,COMMA just by swimming around .PERIOD 
And two boats .PERIOD When the second boat was added ,COMMA what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely .PERIOD 
We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .PERIOD 
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at .PERIOD 
So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here .PERIOD 
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast .PERIOD Humpbacks .PERIOD 
It's loud clear -- you can hear it very clearly .PERIOD 
But you can still hear that faint call .PERIOD 
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound .PERIOD 
Now think about it .PERIOD This is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate the main source globally on our planet ,COMMA for the noise comes from human ships ,COMMA thousands of human ships ,COMMA distant far away ,COMMA just all aggregating .PERIOD 
Same thing in the north atlantic in the '50s ,COMMA versus <NUM> .PERIOD 
So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate ,COMMA or are not able to perform critical functions .PERIOD 
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull ,COMMA you can reduce that noise by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
What maersk did is ,COMMA they worked ways to slow down .PERIOD 
And third ,COMMA you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends ,COMMA you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about because i think that at heart .PERIOD We are all storytellers .PERIOD 
Curtis wong :COLON thank you .PERIOD Roy .PERIOD 
So microsoft -- this is a project that -- worldwide telescope is dedicated to jim gray ,COMMA who's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did ,COMMA is really what makes this project possible .PERIOD 
And so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here .PERIOD And in the ted lab ,COMMA we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old named benjamin that will knock your socks off .PERIOD 
Two-thirds of all students in special ed .PERIOD Remedial programs are guys .PERIOD 
And we're seeing a steady increase among males .PERIOD 
They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships ,COMMA which build gradually and subtly .PERIOD 
I can create big things out here ,COMMA but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started and make even smaller things here .PERIOD 
But the neat thing about it is ,COMMA i can add control points .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here ,COMMA with multiple control points ,COMMA is actually something that's state of the art .PERIOD 
Don't worry .PERIOD 
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually ,COMMA is .PERIOD 
I think none of these is the problem .PERIOD 
We want to go on with our daily life .PERIOD Even though we are not living under normal circumstances .PERIOD 
In the end ,COMMA benjamín and julián ,COMMA decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .PERIOD 
That devotion we feel for the national football team .PERIOD 
We need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action .PERIOD 
The battle is won ,COMMA but we still have to fight it .PERIOD 
Juggling :COLON three balls is simple and normal .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA then you've got to combine them ,COMMA because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you .PERIOD 
And then you get crazy .PERIOD 
Now i'm actually going to ask you to try something .PERIOD So you've got to pay attention complexity .PERIOD If you spend enough time doing something ,COMMA time slows down or your skill increases .PERIOD So your perceptions change .PERIOD 
Things slow down ,COMMA as you learn as you learn ,COMMA as you learn .PERIOD 
So complexity .PERIOD Now ,COMMA how many ?QUESTIONMARK Here are jugglers .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD It looks like a mess .PERIOD It looks like a mess with a guy there who's got his hands around that mess .PERIOD Ok .PERIOD 
It's being able to do something that other people can't do ,COMMA or can't understand .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA so that's one way of doing it ,COMMA which is five balls down .PERIOD 
Make it wider .PERIOD 
Make it narrower .PERIOD 
Enough of a clue .PERIOD So you get the pattern ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Pink .PERIOD 
So white ball and -- finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink .PERIOD 
Finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink or finger .PERIOD 
I don't need music for it talking about time in a moment .PERIOD 
Ahhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So a moment .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA and then what i did as a juggler was say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else ?QUESTIONMARK Another dynamic .PERIOD 
So a moment .PERIOD 
Are we ready to do that ?QUESTIONMARK Yes .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways ,COMMA and also -- oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you're bored ,COMMA not here ,COMMA here's one use for it .PERIOD 
Two sticks .PERIOD You can go with it .PERIOD Thanks .PERIOD 
It's a combination of that the beauty of that ,COMMA the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents .PERIOD 
And it's going to change as i go through it .PERIOD 
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD Richard ,COMMA it's been a big ,COMMA enjoyable part of my life coming here .PERIOD 
And so it was great fun in those days .PERIOD And some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients .PERIOD 
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth ,COMMA and we'd put it on the conference table ,COMMA and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ooh and ah .PERIOD 
That was a really good time .PERIOD 
But something's happened in the last <NUM> years since richard started ted ,COMMA and that's that people like us -- i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time ,COMMA but for us we've really just started .PERIOD We've kind of climbed maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design ,COMMA human-centeredness in an approach to design .PERIOD 
And i think you're starting to see that ,COMMA and it's making our job even more enjoyable .PERIOD 
And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship .PERIOD 
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses ,COMMA as opposed to them being empty .PERIOD 
So you can see what you look like from the back ,COMMA or all the way around as you look .PERIOD 
This is cbs .PERIOD Sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago .PERIOD 
And my favorite feature ,COMMA which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment .PERIOD And then when you come back ,COMMA it comes up to greet you ,COMMA happy to see you .PERIOD 
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it ,COMMA as well as wastewater .PERIOD 
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .PERIOD 
It can dive to <NUM> feet ,COMMA to where sunlight does not penetrate .PERIOD And is equipped with powerful lights .PERIOD 
(narrator ,COMMA and this central box connects the whole system together .PERIOD 
And so by doing that ,COMMA the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college ,COMMA and she's going to be able to do it because of these things .PERIOD 
As in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently ,COMMA the marriage suffered a setback in <NUM> ,COMMA when the husband was killed by the wife .PERIOD 
We can't see into the engine room .PERIOD 
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz ,COMMA and there is only energy ,COMMA and you can't see energy .PERIOD 
Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness ,COMMA she turns it to her advantage .PERIOD 
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in .PERIOD 
So one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see ,COMMA we also can't understand .PERIOD 
But we can't read each other's minds .PERIOD I find that quite astonishing .PERIOD 
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist .PERIOD 
And this is increasingly peculiar ,COMMA because ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA when they started delving into the genome ,COMMA they thought it would probably contain around <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
You can't see these things ,COMMA but they are very strange .PERIOD 
Because that's where all the stuff happens .PERIOD That makes you who you are .PERIOD 
This is fascinating .PERIOD You probably know some of you ,COMMA that cells are continually renewed .PERIOD You can see it in skin .PERIOD And this kind of stuff .PERIOD 
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point .PERIOD 
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer a spine takes several years .PERIOD 
There is so many things that -- light .PERIOD 
Five out of the <NUM> billion galaxies with the naked eye .PERIOD And one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight .PERIOD 
What the others are here for ,COMMA i've no idea .PERIOD 
So we were thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is the practical axis .PERIOD 
This is extremely practical ,COMMA but not so awesome .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA again ,COMMA we kind of caved in ,COMMA and we did the very practical approach ,COMMA which was a bit less awesome .PERIOD 
We said .PERIOD Well ,COMMA instead of releasing the full text ,COMMA we're going to release statistics about the books .PERIOD 
It's four words :COLON we call that a four-gram .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA which one should i use .PERIOD 
As of about six months ago ,COMMA the state of the art in this field is that you would ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair ,COMMA and you'd say ,COMMA steve ,COMMA you're an expert on the irregular verbs .PERIOD 
So if you want to become famous early on ,COMMA you should be an actor ,COMMA because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you're still young .PERIOD It's really great .PERIOD 
One mistake :COLON you should not do is become a mathematician .PERIOD 
Here's a simple way to do it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA here -- this suppression index is for <NUM> people ,COMMA picked in english books where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this basically tightly centered on one .PERIOD 
What you expect is basically what you observe .PERIOD 
But much ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA the distribution is much wider .PERIOD 
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture .PERIOD 
There's various types of frustration .PERIOD 
This person studies all the arghs ,COMMA from one through eight a's .PERIOD 
These all happen to be on our computers on computers across the world .PERIOD 
And when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past ,COMMA our present and human culture .PERIOD 
One of them is pattern recognition .PERIOD 
We listen to differences ,COMMA we discount sounds that remain the same .PERIOD 
Why did i say that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there are a lot of reasons for this .PERIOD 
And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously ,COMMA i think -- by personal broadcasting .PERIOD 
And only without conscious listening .PERIOD Can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all ,COMMA is a very scary place indeed .PERIOD 
It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening .PERIOD 
So mundane sounds can be really interesting if you pay attention .PERIOD 
You can use this in listening in communication .PERIOD 
Why is it not taught ?QUESTIONMARK It's crazy .PERIOD 
Thank you for listening to me today .PERIOD 
So what happened was ,COMMA when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in '<NUM> ,COMMA i decided -- i went to work for intel ,COMMA and i was in the computer industry -- and three months into that ,COMMA i fell in love with something else .PERIOD And i said ,COMMA i made the wrong career choice here ,COMMA and i fell in love with brains .PERIOD 
We are in the pre-paradigm days ,COMMA if you want to use thomas kuhn .PERIOD 
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences .PERIOD 
You're more complicated than your brain .PERIOD You've got a brain .PERIOD 
That's always been the case .PERIOD And so all we can say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my neocortex ,COMMA which is the part of the brain .PERIOD I'm interested in ,COMMA has <NUM> billion cells .PERIOD 
The best minds were stumped -- really ,COMMA really smart people .PERIOD 
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things ,COMMA but once you've thought of them ,COMMA it's kind of easy to understand it .PERIOD 
So it was intuitive and obvious .PERIOD Now ,COMMA what about evolution .PERIOD 
And i'm going to work you through this in a few slides here .PERIOD Give you an example of what this means .PERIOD Here's a system .PERIOD 
And alan turing defined ,COMMA the turing test ,COMMA which is essentially saying ,COMMA we'll know if something's intelligent .PERIOD If it behaves identical to a human .PERIOD 
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is ,COMMA and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .PERIOD 
You're not aware of this ,COMMA but your eyes are always moving .PERIOD 
It's not always true ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA there's not a good history of theory in biology .PERIOD 
Not like computer memory it's not at all like computer memory .PERIOD 
You cannot learn or recall anything ,COMMA outside of a sequence .PERIOD 
If you don't build it ,COMMA you don't understand it .PERIOD So one more slide here .PERIOD 
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .PERIOD 
But ultimately ,COMMA the world's the limit here .PERIOD 
I don't know how this is going to turn out .PERIOD 
They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the internet ,COMMA and all this kind of stuff .PERIOD 
I do not think about what i consider to be peace ,COMMA which is sustainable peace with justice and equality .PERIOD 
But he's offering <NUM> billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons .PERIOD 
In global terms ,COMMA it's a little bit of money .PERIOD 
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime ,COMMA unless we get up off our .PERIOD 
I was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and his holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city ,COMMA and there were about eight of us nobel laureates .PERIOD 
We're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak .PERIOD And he leans over to me and he says ,COMMA jody ,COMMA i'm a buddhist monk .PERIOD 
I spoke with aung sun suu kyi ,COMMA a couple of days ago .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country .PERIOD 
Here's another woman hero of mine .PERIOD 
She says ,COMMA the airports of the world .PERIOD 
They call her the tree lady ,COMMA but she's more than the tree lady .PERIOD 
This is rigoberta .PERIOD Menchu tum .PERIOD 
It's not a dirty word .PERIOD 
It's hard work every single day .PERIOD 
And then when she closed the door ,COMMA grandma said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD No .PERIOD 
And they also when they want to travel ,COMMA they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .PERIOD 
And they want the washing machine .PERIOD 
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ?QUESTIONMARK What is special with this .PERIOD 
And over there ,COMMA they don't even use one each .PERIOD 
What are the trends if we just prolong the trends without any real advanced analysis to <NUM> ,COMMA there are two things that can increase the energy use .PERIOD 
And these <NUM> units -- still the richest people use most of it .PERIOD 
They must change behavior in some way .PERIOD 
They must also start to produce green energy ,COMMA much more green energy .PERIOD 
I was like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that's social skill .PERIOD 
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon ,COMMA and you watch the kids come out .PERIOD And they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks .PERIOD 
Another finding is that the unconscious ,COMMA far from being dumb and sexualized ,COMMA is actually quite smart .PERIOD 
And the way you should do that is study the furniture ,COMMA let it marinate in your mind ,COMMA distract yourself .PERIOD And then a few days later ,COMMA go with your gut ,COMMA because unconsciously you've figured it out .PERIOD 
Now i'm a middle-aged guy .PERIOD 
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way .PERIOD But i don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie .PERIOD And then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives .PERIOD 
They have trouble relating to other people .PERIOD 
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers .PERIOD 
They have epistemological modesty .PERIOD 
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity .PERIOD 
The third trait is metis .PERIOD What we might call street smarts -- it's a greek word .PERIOD 
And that comes in tremendously handy ,COMMA because groups are smarter than individuals .PERIOD 
What picasso did ,COMMA for example ,COMMA was take the concept ,COMMA western art and the concept ,COMMA african masks and blend them together -- not only the geometry ,COMMA but the moral systems entailed in them .PERIOD 
And these are skills ,COMMA again .PERIOD We can't count and measure .PERIOD 
Just to let ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i do not have a lexicographical whistle .PERIOD 
But people think that my job is to let the good words ,COMMA make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary ,COMMA and keep the bad words out .PERIOD 
And it's not very fun .PERIOD And when parts of your job are not easy or fun ,COMMA you kind of look for an excuse .PERIOD Not to do them .PERIOD 
But why do people want me to direct traffic ,COMMA when i would much rather go fishing .PERIOD 
Why do i blame the queen .PERIOD 
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA i'm a huge geek :COLON i love computers .PERIOD 
It's steampunk .PERIOD What we have is an electric velocipede .PERIOD 
Online dictionaries must be different .PERIOD 
This is flat .PERIOD Look how many links .PERIOD There are .PERIOD In the actual entry .PERIOD Two .PERIOD 
So it's not that we have good words and bad words .PERIOD 
Some of my best friends are books .PERIOD 
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen ?QUESTIONMARK Hammer ?QUESTIONMARK 
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic ,COMMA if we've transcended paper ,COMMA if we are worrying less about control and more about description ,COMMA then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile .PERIOD 
If only one out of every <NUM> of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it ,COMMA that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's pretty to look at for a while ,COMMA but then it dies .PERIOD 
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .PERIOD 
I was <NUM> .PERIOD When i was gang-raped by eight men .PERIOD 
But the rest ,COMMA who succumb into it ,COMMA go through everyday torture .PERIOD 
These are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use .PERIOD You throw you .PERIOD 
And we are silent about them .PERIOD 
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections ,COMMA sexually transmitted infections ,COMMA hiv ,COMMA aids ,COMMA syphilis ,COMMA gonorrhea ,COMMA you name it ,COMMA substance abuse ,COMMA drugs .PERIOD Everything under the sun .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA my challenge was to understand ,COMMA how can i get out the power from this pain .PERIOD 
What has been my challenge .PERIOD 
My biggest challenge is society .PERIOD 
It's you and me .PERIOD 
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .PERIOD 
So i'm just going to grab a chair here .PERIOD 
I had this company that i'd spent <NUM> years building .PERIOD It's called future .PERIOD It was a magazine publishing company .PERIOD 
It had recently :COLON gone public .PERIOD And the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars .PERIOD A number ,COMMA i didn't really understand .PERIOD 
The date was february <NUM> .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it had to right ,COMMA i was in ,COMMA for quite a surprise .PERIOD 
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day every day for <NUM> months .PERIOD 
Turns out that the research done on ,COMMA that is absolutely mind-blowing .PERIOD 
It's the total brain experience .PERIOD We're going to .PERIOD 
So i will ,COMMA here's the vision for ted .PERIOD 
This is a video prototype .PERIOD 
And they don't react to background .PERIOD Sounds .PERIOD 
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility .PERIOD 
Soren enters the room pop .PERIOD He goes invisible .PERIOD 
So people would walking into the room ,COMMA and they'd almost ignore it ,COMMA thinking .PERIOD It was some crap laying around .PERIOD 
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man .PERIOD 
Because if that circle weren't there and the floor was very even ,COMMA it would start to wander about in the space .PERIOD 
That's my colleague ,COMMA he's let it go .PERIOD 
And if it isn't easily gotten ,COMMA we'll go ahead and steal it .PERIOD 
While the carbon dioxide ,COMMA vast quantities of it ,COMMA gigatons ,COMMA goes into the atmosphere ,COMMA where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about .PERIOD 
They've run out of good sites .PERIOD 
Babcock &amp .PERIOD Wilcox that make nuclear reactors .PERIOD Here's an integral fast reactor .PERIOD 
Co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming ,COMMA and converted to co2 .PERIOD 
We have facilities around there .PERIOD You also have a buffer zone that's <NUM> square kilometers .PERIOD 
And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with .PERIOD 
There are two nations ,COMMA north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all .PERIOD 
There's plenty of solar and wind .PERIOD 
That's from real data .PERIOD 
Solving the world's problems can be done .PERIOD If you really put your mind to it and use clean ,COMMA renewable energy .PERIOD 
And in the united states senate ,COMMA we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming through the senate .PERIOD And this room can help .PERIOD 
The first is be aware of the propaganda .PERIOD 
And i'm ,COMMA you know ,COMMA very much pro that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s ,COMMA and i continue to do so now .PERIOD 
Because five years from now it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible ,COMMA disastrous nuclear power .PERIOD 
Your final pitch .PERIOD Stewart .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so thank you mark .PERIOD 
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the earth ,COMMA take the people of earth and transition off ,COMMA permanently ,COMMA and that's exciting .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy ,COMMA a chance to if you would back up the biosphere .PERIOD 
And if you think about space ,COMMA everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space .PERIOD 
And we knew nothing about going to space .PERIOD 
We went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years ,COMMA and the average age of the people that got us .PERIOD There was <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
The ;SEMICOLON shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch .PERIOD 
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier ,COMMA we should be allowed to risk .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA anyone who says we shouldn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just needs to be put aside because as we go forward ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the greatest discoveries we will ever know ,COMMA is ahead of us .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA the large corporations ,COMMA the governments can't take the risk .PERIOD 
We've got an altitude call of <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA you can go and experience weightless flights .PERIOD 
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .PERIOD 
That was filmed inside our airplane .PERIOD And so you can now do this .PERIOD 
Let me talk about the other thing i'm excited about .PERIOD 
It may or may not happen .PERIOD But if you put up a prize ,COMMA the beautiful thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a very small maintenance fee .PERIOD And you pay on success .PERIOD 
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself .PERIOD 
We all seem to think that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we look down on the ground ,COMMA there's nothing there .PERIOD 
And we use the word ,COMMA nothing .PERIOD 
I told her ,COMMA i couldn't face it .PERIOD Because the way the teacher was treating me ,COMMA ridiculing me .PERIOD And using me as an example of failure .PERIOD 
So i told her .PERIOD 
And walked off ,COMMA and i didn't expect that ,COMMA because i expected one of these .PERIOD 
So i'm sitting there thinking .PERIOD 
So i did .PERIOD 
But i thought ,COMMA perhaps the ant won't know ,COMMA it'll probably move in .PERIOD 
And then i sat down and all the ants came along .PERIOD 
It became part of me .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA that's a pinhead .PERIOD 
Now that is called the huf haus .PERIOD 
So i'm thinking ,COMMA mr .PERIOD Huf isn't going to be very happy .PERIOD When i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere .PERIOD Somewhere .PERIOD 
So to cut the story short ,COMMA i decided that i had to go back and do it .PERIOD 
So i found some more ,COMMA and i decided to sort of construct it very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA holding my breath working between my heartbeat ,COMMA and making sure everything is leveled .PERIOD 
I noticed that the house was occupied .PERIOD 
So basically i'd completed the house .PERIOD 
So i didn't think he was going to throw bart off .PERIOD 
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air .PERIOD 
But i would never do it to a living fly .PERIOD 
Even though they get on our nerves ,COMMA i would never kill an insect ,COMMA because all creatures ,COMMA great and small -- there is a hymn that says that .PERIOD 
So i have to be very ,COMMA very careful .PERIOD 
My work ,COMMA rough estimate ,COMMA sometimes five ,COMMA six to seven weeks .PERIOD You can't always anticipate .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA there's an aphid fly there .PERIOD 
I remember one time i was doing it ,COMMA and the window was open .PERIOD 
And then she looked at me .PERIOD 
And i cut off a little flake of gold .PERIOD 
Because i had to put the torch on the top .PERIOD 
The :COLON flag :COLON had to be made out of little strands of gold .PERIOD 
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right .PERIOD 
And that was done with a particle from my shirt .PERIOD 
My point is ,COMMA here people have a choice -- just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono .PERIOD 
Which is why ?QUESTIONMARK I prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA tradition becomes more important .PERIOD Not less important .PERIOD 
We're here we're part of a community ,COMMA sharing out ideas and discussing them .PERIOD 
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity .PERIOD 
We have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists and arabs ,COMMA who are not muslims -- not all arabs are ,COMMA muslims ,COMMA by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA it was a new discovery .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA visual expression is just one form of culture integration .PERIOD 
In a similar way ,COMMA we have created the doha film institute .PERIOD 
Who are you playing .PERIOD 
The doha :COLON tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub ;SEMICOLON katara .PERIOD 
I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .PERIOD 
And in a saying of the koran ,COMMA which to muslims ,COMMA is god speaking to humanity ?QUESTIONMARK God says to his prophet muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets ,COMMA beginning with adam ,COMMA including noah ,COMMA including moses ,COMMA including abraham ,COMMA including jesus christ .PERIOD And ending with muhammad -- that we have not sent you o ,COMMA muhammad except as a 'rahmah' ,COMMA except as a source of compassion ,COMMA to humanity .PERIOD 
The esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism ,COMMA or tasawwuf in arabic .PERIOD 
The language differs ,COMMA but the objective is the same .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being ,COMMA of being alive ,COMMA of beingness ;SEMICOLON the attribute of wisdom ,COMMA of consciousness ,COMMA of awareness and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .PERIOD 
And i believe ,COMMA personally ,COMMA that we're on the verge ,COMMA and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah .PERIOD 
My story actually began when i was four years old ,COMMA and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah ,COMMA georgia .PERIOD 
That's why they were called ape hangers .PERIOD 
And one afternoon ,COMMA i got a call from my doctor .PERIOD 
The next day i came to see him ,COMMA i was like doctor .PERIOD That was a really good joke .PERIOD 
I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives .PERIOD I wrote these men .PERIOD 
Linda :COLON my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .PERIOD 
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle .PERIOD 
Will you help be their dad .PERIOD 
And i got to the end -- he was crying ,COMMA and i was crying -- and then he looked at me and he said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
And as he talked ,COMMA he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says ,COMMA let's go cow tipping .PERIOD Even though we never did tip the cow .PERIOD Even though no one tips the cow ,COMMA even though cows don't sleep standing up .PERIOD 
And then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon dr .PERIOD John healey at memorial .PERIOD Sloan-kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium .PERIOD 
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body .PERIOD 
When my wife and i had kids ,COMMA we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA it was everybody running the other way .PERIOD 
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me .PERIOD 
Now david is my literary agent .PERIOD 
So one day near the end of my journey ,COMMA i said ,COMMA come on girls .PERIOD Let's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge .PERIOD 
We set out on crutches .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA for the four million years humans have been walking upright ,COMMA the act is essentially unchanged .PERIOD 
As my physical therapist likes to say ,COMMA every step is a tragedy .PERIOD Waiting to happen .PERIOD 
You go ,COMMA slow ,COMMA you get where you're going .PERIOD But you get there with this community .PERIOD You built along the way .PERIOD 
So i stand here today ,COMMA as you see now walking without crutches or a cane .PERIOD 
And last week ,COMMA i had my 18-month scans .PERIOD 
And all the collective minds in this room i dare say ,COMMA can never find a solution for scan-xiety .PERIOD 
I feel that i've fitted in ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA to some of the things that i've heard .PERIOD 
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world .PERIOD That's clean ,COMMA a world .PERIOD That isn't contaminated .PERIOD A world that isn't .PERIOD Polluted .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- i can't really call it a civilization .PERIOD 
And i propose to bring into this ted conference ,COMMA as i always do around the world ,COMMA the voice of the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood ,COMMA five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother and then another three ,COMMA four or five years of emotional dependence on her .PERIOD Even when the next child is born .PERIOD 
They can actually live longer than <NUM> in captivity ,COMMA so we've only done <NUM> years in the wild .PERIOD So far .PERIOD 
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- self ,COMMA as opposed to other .PERIOD 
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know only too well .PERIOD 
And people will pay more for bush-meat ,COMMA as it's called than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred .PERIOD 
We can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future ,COMMA discuss ideas with each other ,COMMA so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group .PERIOD 
And that's not just in the far-away developing world .PERIOD That's everywhere .PERIOD 
Somebody said that yesterday .PERIOD 
And roots and shoots is a program for hope .PERIOD 
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet .PERIOD 
It isn't something that their parents tell them ,COMMA or their teachers .PERIOD Tell them .PERIOD 
That's effective .PERIOD But if they decide themselves ,COMMA we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD Violence :COLON no bombs .PERIOD No .PERIOD Guns .PERIOD 
How many more minutes two one .PERIOD 
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world ,COMMA a better place .PERIOD 
It's very encouraging .PERIOD 
And we've talked a lot about that .PERIOD 
And then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling ,COMMA they couldn't worry about the environment ,COMMA any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them .PERIOD Somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi .PERIOD If you look back through human history ,COMMA you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good .PERIOD 
And just after that ,COMMA a woman brought me this little bell .PERIOD And i want to end on this note .PERIOD 
It's in our hands .PERIOD 
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints ,COMMA if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not .PERIOD We can change the world overnight .PERIOD 
In the laboratory ,COMMA what we want to do is much the same .PERIOD But with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity ,COMMA but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .PERIOD 
This is how we can start to make a protocell .PERIOD 
As you know ,COMMA when you put oil and water together ,COMMA they don't mix .PERIOD But through self-assembly we can get a nice oil droplet to form .PERIOD And we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism .PERIOD Or for our protocell ,COMMA as you will see ,COMMA later .PERIOD 
This structure then can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself .PERIOD So it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself .PERIOD And that's shown in green here on this micrograph .PERIOD 
It's actually quite lifeless .PERIOD Once it forms ,COMMA it doesn't really do anything .PERIOD 
So some things that are missing is ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you had a flow of energy through a system ,COMMA what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy ,COMMA in order to maintain itself ,COMMA much like living systems do .PERIOD 
So i add some food source to the system .PERIOD 
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do ,COMMA and depending on the conditions ,COMMA we have some protocells on the left that are moving around ,COMMA and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .PERIOD 
So then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times ,COMMA and one time ,COMMA something very interesting happened .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA since we can make some interesting protocells that we like interesting colors and interesting behaviors ,COMMA and they're very easy to make ,COMMA and they have interesting lifelike properties ,COMMA perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth .PERIOD Perhaps these represent an easily accessible step .PERIOD One of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .PERIOD 
They look really good ,COMMA very nice movement ,COMMA and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other ,COMMA similar to what we've seen before -- but again ,COMMA working with just primordial conditions ,COMMA no ,COMMA pure chemicals .PERIOD 
They're even better models of environmental health ,COMMA because not only the same mammalian biology ,COMMA but they share your diet ,COMMA largely .PERIOD 
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water ,COMMA which was interesting .PERIOD 
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb .PERIOD Though ,COMMA there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block .PERIOD 
They flatten a few plants ,COMMA no big deal .PERIOD They'll regenerate .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there .PERIOD It's infiltrating pollutants .PERIOD 
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health .PERIOD 
Here's one of them that we have up now .PERIOD 
When a fish swims underneath ,COMMA a light goes on .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like .PERIOD 
So there's another function on here .PERIOD 
And they text back .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA instead of throwing chewing gum or doritos ,COMMA or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there's a body of water in iceland that i've been dealing with .PERIOD That's in the middle of the city .PERIOD And the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution .PERIOD It's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds .PERIOD 
They're cross-species delicious that is ,COMMA delicious for humans and non-humans .PERIOD 
And you say ,COMMA boy ,COMMA that's a lot .PERIOD 
But you know what .PERIOD 
Now if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth that would stretch around the earth <NUM> times .PERIOD 
And we wanted to take advantage of moore's law with electronic controls and software .PERIOD And we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .PERIOD 
So let me talk about hydrogen .PERIOD First .PERIOD 
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources .PERIOD It can come from fossil fuels .PERIOD It can come from any way that you can create electricity ,COMMA including renewables .PERIOD 
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid .PERIOD 
And we talked about swarm networks earlier .PERIOD 
Actually the theme of this conference ,COMMA i think ,COMMA has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off -- and that's relationships and working together .PERIOD 
I just want to ask one .PERIOD 
We're into this over a billion dollars already .PERIOD So i would hope people would think we're serious .PERIOD When we're spending that kind of money .PERIOD 
In oxford ,COMMA perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass .PERIOD That is new york city to try and see our true selves or perhaps pass through to another world .PERIOD 
My colleagues and i have been working for <NUM> years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project .PERIOD 
And i'd like to tell you the story in three acts .PERIOD And if i have time still ,COMMA an epilogue .PERIOD 
It was once a beach ,COMMA and this painting has john james audubon ,COMMA the painter sitting on the rock .PERIOD 
Or this painting ,COMMA from the 1740s from greenwich village .PERIOD 
Here's bowling green .PERIOD And here's broadway .PERIOD 
And just beyond it ,COMMA you can see features that have vanished ,COMMA things that have disappeared .PERIOD 
Or murray hill ,COMMA and this is the murrays' house on murray hill .PERIOD <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And i thought to myself ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if i could georeference this map ,COMMA if i could place this map in the grid of the city today ,COMMA i could find these lost features of the city ,COMMA in the block-by-block geography that people know ,COMMA the geography of where people go to work and where they go to live ,COMMA and where they like to eat .PERIOD 
Then if we added maps ,COMMA like the geology ,COMMA the bedrock geology ,COMMA and the surface geology ,COMMA what the glaciers leave ,COMMA if we make the soil map with the <NUM> soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service ,COMMA if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were .PERIOD Then we can calculate the slopes .PERIOD 
We can calculate the aspect .PERIOD 
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds .PERIOD 
We compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape .PERIOD 
And the old fields ,COMMA the successional fields that go .PERIOD 
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity .PERIOD 
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict ,COMMA where you would find the beaver .PERIOD 
An aspen needs fire .PERIOD And dry soils .PERIOD 
But what are the conditions that make it possible .PERIOD 
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there ,COMMA and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses ,COMMA the butterflies ,COMMA the fish in the stream ,COMMA the birds in the trees .PERIOD 
And perhaps a black bear walked by and maybe native americans ,COMMA were there .PERIOD 
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii .PERIOD 
We can see the fields that the native americans made .PERIOD 
So when you're watching law and order ,COMMA and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house right into the collect pond .PERIOD <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And i think this is what we're learning about ,COMMA building cities in the future .PERIOD 
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .PERIOD 
Fill in the blanks .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA while this society is without a doubt ,COMMA the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created ,COMMA it's got some major ,COMMA major flaws .PERIOD 
Clearly we don't have <NUM> planets .PERIOD 
And they may not want to live exactly like us .PERIOD 
You know .PERIOD So ,COMMA on the one hand we have the unthinkable .PERIOD On the other hand ,COMMA we have the unimaginable .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools ,COMMA models and ideas ,COMMA which if widely adopted would change the game .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is vancouver ,COMMA which if you haven't been there ,COMMA you ought to go for a visit .PERIOD It's a fabulous city .PERIOD 
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other .PERIOD One of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places .PERIOD 
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .PERIOD 
All throughout the developing world ,COMMA people are going directly to cell phones .PERIOD Skipping the whole landline stage .PERIOD 
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate ,COMMA you get different kinds of solutions .PERIOD 
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital right .PERIOD 
It's doing something new .PERIOD There's new things happening .PERIOD 
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out .PERIOD 
Another world is possible .PERIOD 
We tweak that a lot .PERIOD 
We're looking a lot at this .PERIOD This is spreading everywhere .PERIOD 
This is from a force more powerful .PERIOD It's a little screenshot .PERIOD 
These are refrigerators that require no electricity .PERIOD They're pot within a pot design .PERIOD 
How do we help people like that .PERIOD 
Audience ,COMMA it detects landmines .PERIOD 
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered .PERIOD You can fling these seeds out into the field .PERIOD 
And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle .PERIOD That the college bakery said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK We're getting out of that business .PERIOD 
If you're an amateur ,COMMA you don't have access to our machine anymore .PERIOD 
So the policing layer around the problem ,COMMA becomes the real threat of the act .PERIOD 
And the back story is this :COLON sopa and pipa as legislation ,COMMA were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century .PERIOD 
And congress did something .PERIOD 
And that law was called the audio home recording act of <NUM> .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when the audio home recording act of <NUM> was passed ,COMMA the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework ,COMMA they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment .PERIOD 
It was a complicated piece of legislation .PERIOD A lot of moving parts .PERIOD 
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation .PERIOD 
Every dvd player and game player and television and computer ;SEMICOLON you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries ,COMMA if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content .PERIOD 
So this is the internet .PERIOD They have in mind .PERIOD 
Imagine it says ted ,COMMA because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost .PERIOD 
And if you're not an american citizen ,COMMA you can contact american citizens that you know ,COMMA and encourage them to do the same .PERIOD 
And the dmca goes back to the audio home recording act which horrified those industries .PERIOD 
They just want the sharing to go away .PERIOD 
The whole world is laid out for you .PERIOD The best jobs are laid out for you .PERIOD And you want to go and work in a village .PERIOD 
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .PERIOD 
You failed in your exam .PERIOD 
The education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK Are you doing in this village .PERIOD 
You have to have a dignity of labor .PERIOD 
A traditional midwife is ,COMMA a professional .PERIOD 
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate .PERIOD 
So when i said that they said ,COMMA well show us what is possible .PERIOD What are you doing .PERIOD 
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men .PERIOD 
It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified .PERIOD 
So long as the sun shines ,COMMA we'll have no problem with power .PERIOD 
And we have <NUM> meals twice a day of solar cooking .PERIOD 
She looks after <NUM> goats in the morning .PERIOD But she's prime minister in the evening .PERIOD 
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening .PERIOD 
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high .PERIOD We use puppetry .PERIOD 
Why because they want to leave the village and go to a city ,COMMA looking for a job .PERIOD 
Comes back goes into the village says ,COMMA well ,COMMA what's the story .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA these two grandmothers grandmothers .PERIOD The minister couldn't believe what was happening .PERIOD 
Went straight to the president .PERIOD 
So he summoned me and said ,COMMA can you train me ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> grandmothers .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA she is very beautiful .PERIOD 
And when i went back six months later ,COMMA i said ,COMMA where's your husband ?QUESTIONMARK 
Don't listen to the world bank ,COMMA listen to the people on the ground .PERIOD 
Our :COLON scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .PERIOD 
For artists ,COMMA we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .PERIOD 
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .PERIOD 
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?QUESTIONMARK 
A system of cognitive processes ,COMMA largely non-conscious cognitive processes ,COMMA that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .PERIOD 
Who are these characters ?QUESTIONMARK Who are so damn happy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Some of you are old enough to remember ,COMMA he was the chairman of the house of representatives ,COMMA and he resigned in disgrace .PERIOD When this young republican named newt gingrich found out about a shady book deal ,COMMA he had done .PERIOD 
So he went to find them ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we can give you a franchise on this for <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA never ever join the beatles .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA because the experiment i'm going to tell you about uses them ,COMMA these are monet prints .PERIOD 
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia .PERIOD These are hospitalized patients .PERIOD 
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four .PERIOD 
Really jim you don't remember .PERIOD I was just here ,COMMA with the monet prints .PERIOD 
Free !EXCLAMATIONMARK Aren't you just giving me my own paper ?QUESTIONMARK 
What are you doing .PERIOD 
They don't like their picture ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA even after the opportunity to swap has expired ,COMMA they still don't like their picture .PERIOD Why .PERIOD 
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures you'd have four days to change your mind .PERIOD Or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures .PERIOD And you make up your mind right away .PERIOD And you can never change it which course .PERIOD Would you like to be in .PERIOD 
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- esther .PERIOD My mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta .PERIOD 
There's a historical marker .PERIOD 
I guess i must .PERIOD 
Oh .PERIOD Jesus .PERIOD 
Puts it in reverse fifty-five ,COMMA out of the driveway in reverse .PERIOD 
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what ,COMMA i'm talking about .PERIOD 
And there she goes ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so i stopped at a light and there's a guy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the back .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you have all been at a mall during the holidays .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD 
It will upset .PERIOD You .PERIOD 
Look :COLON the chevy -- he's coming this way .PERIOD 
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid ,COMMA you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA her comeback is ,COMMA when have i embarrassed you .PERIOD 
A brevity ,COMMA brevity of everything with this child .PERIOD 
But she pauses occasionally and says ,COMMA how do you spell that what year ?QUESTIONMARK Ok .PERIOD 
When she writes the expose in about <NUM> years ,COMMA don't believe a word of it .PERIOD 
But this is my daughter lauren .PERIOD My remarkable daughter ,COMMA my borderline asperger's kid .PERIOD 
She says ,COMMA ma ,COMMA you got to look .PERIOD 
Now when this kid says i got to look ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA jesus .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD Jesus .PERIOD 
I finally come -- and now it's the south .PERIOD 
We want to curl up and say ,COMMA tell it to me ,COMMA tell it to me .PERIOD 
I'm with the little lady ,COMMA damn .PERIOD 
After i say -- let me refresh you -- have you no shame .PERIOD 
With her is a young man -- husband ,COMMA brother ,COMMA lover .PERIOD It's not my job .PERIOD 
They turn then ,COMMA shoulder to shoulder and walk away ,COMMA lost in their own reverie .PERIOD 
And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .PERIOD 
Voices :COLON woohoo :COLON yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK Nice .PERIOD 
What are catastrophic effects ,COMMA a three degree centigrade climate change rise ?QUESTIONMARK That will result in <NUM> percent species extinction .PERIOD 
But now i'll talk about some more pleasant things .PERIOD 
How fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car .PERIOD 
Where can i go today ,COMMA and who can i do it with .PERIOD 
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads .PERIOD 
In london ,COMMA the day they turned the congestion pricing on ,COMMA there was a <NUM> percent decrease in congestion overnight .PERIOD And that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing .PERIOD 
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates .PERIOD 
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go because today ,COMMA we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes .PERIOD 
And if we have it ,COMMA you'll decide how many miles to drive ,COMMA what mode of travel ,COMMA where to live and work .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA all mesh-enabled .PERIOD Monthly communication cost zero .PERIOD 
They're resilient their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design .PERIOD 
These things are going to happen .PERIOD 
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the <NUM> or <NUM> years for this to happen .PERIOD 
And if i had my druthers ,COMMA we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards .PERIOD 
When i went this morning to larry brilliant's tedtalk ,COMMA prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks to make all that happen .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the awesome story ,COMMA it begins about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD When my mom and my dad came to canada .PERIOD 
My dad left ,COMMA a small village outside of amritsar india .PERIOD 
And they got here in the late 1960s .PERIOD 
We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses ,COMMA things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .PERIOD 
So you can't actually see them ,COMMA but it was breathtaking .PERIOD Believe me .PERIOD 
My marriage wasn't going well .PERIOD And we just were growing further and further apart .PERIOD 
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage ,COMMA through a lot of tears ,COMMA to have a very honest conversation .PERIOD 
And as these dark clouds were circling me ,COMMA and i was finding it really ,COMMA really difficult to think of anything good .PERIOD I said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive ,COMMA somehow .PERIOD 
And nobody read it ,COMMA except for my mom .PERIOD 
Flash-forward to the next year and the book of awesome ,COMMA has now been number one on the bestseller list for <NUM> straight weeks .PERIOD 
But look ,COMMA i said ,COMMA i wanted to do three things with you today .PERIOD 
It's sad ,COMMA and it's not pleasant to talk about ,COMMA but your husband might leave you ,COMMA your girlfriend could cheat ,COMMA your headaches might be more serious than you thought .PERIOD Or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .PERIOD 
And there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well ,COMMA too ,COMMA with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart .PERIOD And when that bad news washes over you ,COMMA and when that pain sponges and soaks in ,COMMA i just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices .PERIOD 
Because you all used to be three years old .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA three-year-old girl is still part of you .PERIOD 
These were four guys on the la rams in the 1960s .PERIOD You did not want to go up against .PERIOD 
I'd like to pause my tedtalk for about <NUM> seconds ,COMMA right now because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this .PERIOD And my parents are sitting in the front row .PERIOD 
He would say ,COMMA look ,COMMA can you believe they have a mango here from mexico .PERIOD 
You can sleep in clean sheets .PERIOD 
The cashiers at your grocery store ,COMMA the foreman at your plant ,COMMA the guy tailgating you home on the highway ,COMMA the telemarketer calling you during dinner .PERIOD Every teacher you've ever had ,COMMA everyone that's ever woken up beside you ,COMMA every politician in every country ,COMMA every actor in every movie ,COMMA every single person in your family ,COMMA everyone .PERIOD You love ,COMMA everyone in this room .PERIOD And you will be dead in a hundred years .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Dan rather since the september 11th attack on the world trade center ,COMMA many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground .PERIOD 
Now as cbs's ,COMMA jim axelrod reports they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view .PERIOD The scene .PERIOD 
There's a new place in new york ,COMMA where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero .PERIOD 
This is ours .PERIOD 
David rockwell :COLON the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site .PERIOD But as this incredibly moving burial ground .PERIOD 
The walls are bare by design ,COMMA so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .PERIOD 
Your work is highly sensual ,COMMA even hedonistic .PERIOD 
But i've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that .PERIOD 
We were really paralyzed .PERIOD 
And in discussing this with other architects ,COMMA we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them <NUM> stories ,COMMA taller .PERIOD 
It was predominantly a white ,COMMA rich ,COMMA corporate group that was not representative of the city .PERIOD 
And i think this was the 21st ,COMMA and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding .PERIOD 
And i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together ,COMMA watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA i told the contractor to go ahead .PERIOD 
I think this is obviously substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before .PERIOD Just by the nature of it .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on ,COMMA the master plan .PERIOD 
I don't think it has much to do with <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA or <NUM> or <NUM> thousand new office spaces ,COMMA regardless of what the number is .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA which the towers fell into .PERIOD 
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .PERIOD 
This small foundation we put together ,COMMA is looking for other ways to help .PERIOD 
So i thought that would be good to end with .PERIOD 
One of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was .PERIOD 
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on .PERIOD 
As you say ,COMMA it's not a memorial .PERIOD 
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection ,COMMA and its being there ,COMMA almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished ,COMMA is part of its extraordinary -- i don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant ,COMMA world-class neuropsychologist :COLON i had a baby .PERIOD 
Sorry ,COMMA ted .PERIOD 
Because this is what i do .PERIOD This is what i teach .PERIOD 
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .PERIOD 
Would it be crazy to know ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA gs .PERIOD 
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play ,COMMA cleared for return to play ,COMMA applies to them .PERIOD 
If god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion .PERIOD Most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks .PERIOD 
Should your kid play football ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD 
The first study up .PERIOD 
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- co kids with brain injury .PERIOD 
Now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade .PERIOD Right .PERIOD This epiphany of tom's .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
This is ,COMMA but one .PERIOD This is frank gehry the architect's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi .PERIOD 
So my first topic with respect to this was not death ,COMMA but obesity .PERIOD 
So this is a slide of some of our initial results .PERIOD 
How big are the clusters ?QUESTIONMARK How far do they reach .PERIOD 
This here shows on the y-axis ,COMMA the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese ,COMMA and on the x-axis ,COMMA the degrees of separation ,COMMA between the two people .PERIOD 
And the next bar over ,COMMA the [red] line says ,COMMA if your friend's friends are obese ,COMMA your risk of obesity is <NUM> percent ,COMMA higher .PERIOD 
There are at least three possibilities .PERIOD One possibility is that as i gain weight ,COMMA it causes you to gain weight .PERIOD 
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight ,COMMA and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .PERIOD 
Now i want to be very clear .PERIOD We do not think our work should ,COMMA or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .PERIOD 
And by the end ,COMMA you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .PERIOD 
And so this function of emotions suggests that ,COMMA in addition to any other purpose ,COMMA they serve .PERIOD They're a kind of primitive form of communication .PERIOD 
And whether you become happy or not depends ,COMMA in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .PERIOD 
So this work with emotions ,COMMA which are so fundamental then got us to thinking about ,COMMA maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the striking patterns of human social networks ,COMMA their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place ,COMMA and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure .PERIOD 
And finally :COLON compare nodes c and d :COLON c and d .PERIOD Both have six friends .PERIOD 
But now we ,COMMA with a bird's eye view looking at this network ,COMMA can see that they occupy very different social worlds .PERIOD 
So different structural locations have different implications for your life .PERIOD 
They are a kind of social capital .PERIOD 
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks .PERIOD And these properties inhere in the structure of the networks ,COMMA not just in the individuals ,COMMA within them .PERIOD 
They're both made of carbon ,COMMA and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite ,COMMA which is soft and dark .PERIOD 
If i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs ,COMMA you would cut the ties to me .PERIOD And the network would ,COMMA disintegrate .PERIOD 
I'd never seen anything like that .PERIOD 
But after seeing what i've seen ,COMMA the truth is they have not disappeared at all .PERIOD 
And this is happening every day .PERIOD 
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages ,COMMA with cheap webcams ,COMMA lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow .PERIOD 
And you let it go .PERIOD And then right .PERIOD When you see the tail ,COMMA you grab it by the tail ,COMMA then you bring it back in .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you create power ,COMMA then you tame it .PERIOD 
According to the treaty ,COMMA those lands are a sovereign nation .PERIOD 
<NUM> :COLON the second fort laramie treaty clearly ,COMMA guarantees the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas' ownership of the sacred black hills .PERIOD 
A new agreement was presented to sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve :COLON sign the paper ,COMMA or no food for your tribe .PERIOD 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of .PERIOD 
Tribes lost millions of acres .PERIOD 
To this day ,COMMA this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle .PERIOD 
Unemployment on .PERIOD The pine ridge ,COMMA indian reservation fluctuates between <NUM> and <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
This is how we came to own these united states .PERIOD 
And how much of this history do you need to own even .PERIOD 
Because the solution seems so far in the past ,COMMA i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .PERIOD 
That's why there's a glass of water up there .PERIOD 
This solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical advance ,COMMA this century .PERIOD 
And what it was was oral rehydration salts .PERIOD 
Maybe there's a biological answer .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA we spent a lot of energy in many domains -- technological ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA hard work ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA human ingenuity -- to crack important social problems .PERIOD With technology solutions .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem .PERIOD 
The last mile is everywhere ,COMMA problematic .PERIOD 
The problem is ,COMMA this little ,COMMA three-pound machine that's behind your eyes ,COMMA and between your ears .PERIOD 
They do lots of inconsistent things .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake .PERIOD 
So here you all are ,COMMA ostensibly educated people .PERIOD 
Most of you look smart .PERIOD 
I think we've learned the answer to that here .PERIOD 
Almost out of kindergarten .PERIOD 
These models like the leaky bucket ,COMMA work well in most situations .PERIOD 
They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA while you're thinking about that ,COMMA let's move to a second task .PERIOD 
Fifty versus <NUM> .PERIOD That's a big move .PERIOD Eleven versus nine come on .PERIOD 
So far i've been pretty negative .PERIOD 
You just gotta carry this thing around .PERIOD 
Here's another example of this .PERIOD 
This is from a company called positive energy .PERIOD 
And what they find is just this letter .PERIOD Nothing else has a two to three percent reduction in electricity .PERIOD Use .PERIOD 
We have testing .PERIOD We go to the lab ,COMMA we try it again .PERIOD We have refinement .PERIOD 
So this whole area is so fascinating .PERIOD 
How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground in indian villages ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity ,COMMA or nonprofits that have operational capacity .PERIOD 
If you have biological problems we try and fix it see if it works and then work the scale .PERIOD 
When the magazine -- actually ,COMMA when i got the subscription -- it was <NUM> following pages .PERIOD 
If it's -- see it for a long enough time ,COMMA i actually do something about it .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA now if i take that sugar dough ,COMMA the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity .PERIOD 
We call this our sushi circuit .PERIOD It's very popular with kids .PERIOD 
I plug in again the power to it .PERIOD 
I can start plugging in lots of lights .PERIOD 
We've got some videos ,COMMA you can make them yourselves .PERIOD 
We've had a mom in utah ,COMMA who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the uk .PERIOD And curriculum developers in hawaii .PERIOD 
Up .PERIOD Don't move the wrist over the heart .PERIOD Don't move the wrist .PERIOD 
And then look at me .PERIOD 
Good nice ,COMMA and you can sit over there .PERIOD 
Which one shall have a good poker hand .PERIOD 
This guy beats them with four of a kind ,COMMA or deuce -- deuce .PERIOD 
No reaction that with even -- ok ?QUESTIONMARK And this .PERIOD 
These look in order ,COMMA i'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven .PERIOD And .PERIOD 
Such life right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now if you are interested ,COMMA i will demonstrate some underground techniques .PERIOD 
Right .PERIOD You agree ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok .PERIOD 
So -- because if you look now ,COMMA i can still see it .PERIOD 
Come to -- no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD No .PERIOD 
When i'm sober ,COMMA i do this much quicker ,COMMA but we will check .PERIOD 
Pardon ,COMMA but then when we will have it back ,COMMA you do this .PERIOD 
Perfect .PERIOD 
Please name any card .PERIOD Anyone ?QUESTIONMARK 
My fault .PERIOD Don't applaud .PERIOD This was clubs .PERIOD 
But now i do it ,COMMA the regular speed ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
Excellent .PERIOD 
And queen of hearts ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA a false count .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA my -- i should have mentioned that ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
Yeah .PERIOD Good .PERIOD 
I liked it now ,COMMA a little more difficult .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA i don't work with prestige ,COMMA so always do mistakes .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four -- yes ,COMMA the camera .PERIOD Got it .PERIOD Five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight -- ah !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- nine !EXCLAMATIONMARK <NUM> ,COMMA the jack ,COMMA jack of spades .PERIOD Queen of -- i like that laugh .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD Good .PERIOD Queen .PERIOD 
There was the place .PERIOD And here is king of spades ,COMMA correct ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ah ,COMMA this is tough .PERIOD 
Maybe it's important -- yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- nine of diamonds .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i give you a diamonds ,COMMA so they -- so you put them here in a nice row ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK And you can see ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD 
You're peeking .PERIOD You just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back .PERIOD 
We will try .PERIOD 
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet .PERIOD 
I see some of you recognize this child .PERIOD 
At that point they usually give up .PERIOD 
And the 10-year-old on every eight notes .PERIOD 
It can be the other buttock .PERIOD 
These are the people who never listen to classical music .PERIOD 
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas ,COMMA and somebody from rome .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA i'm not sure they'll be up to it .PERIOD 
Do you know what i think probably happened in this room .PERIOD 
And for the rest of your life ,COMMA every time you hear classical music ,COMMA you'll always be able to know .PERIOD If you hear those impulses .PERIOD 
Do you remember hamlet act .PERIOD One scene :COLON three :COLON he finds out that his uncle killed .PERIOD His father .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA otherwise the play would be over stupid .PERIOD 
Now he tries the e again ,COMMA that chord doesn't work .PERIOD 
And i've one last request before i play this piece ,COMMA all the way through .PERIOD 
And i did exactly what i did with you ,COMMA and i told them and explained them .PERIOD And the whole thing .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA how would you walk -- because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA my profession the music profession ,COMMA doesn't see it that way .PERIOD 
People in my orchestra came up to me and said ,COMMA ben ,COMMA what happened ?QUESTIONMARK That's what happened .PERIOD 
Who am i being ?QUESTIONMARK That my children's eyes are not shining .PERIOD 
I learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz one of the rare survivors .PERIOD 
And she told me this ,COMMA she said ,COMMA we were in the train going to auschwitz ,COMMA and i looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Here's what he did :COLON he gathered his participants .PERIOD 
If you're the fastest of everyone ,COMMA we're testing here today ,COMMA you get <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
But for a lot of tasks ,COMMA they actually either don't work ,COMMA or often they do harm .PERIOD 
If you look at the science ,COMMA there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD 
But for 21st century tasks ,COMMA that mechanistic reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work ,COMMA often ,COMMA doesn't work and often ,COMMA does harm .PERIOD 
Same deal you .PERIOD We're timing for norms .PERIOD 
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .PERIOD 
The rules are mystifying .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill ,COMMA a larger reward ,COMMA led to poorer performance .PERIOD 
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards .PERIOD 
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments .PERIOD Higher incentives led to worse performance .PERIOD 
Last month just last month ,COMMA economists at lse ,COMMA looked at <NUM> studies of pay-for-performance plans ,COMMA inside of companies .PERIOD 
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does .PERIOD 
Purpose ,COMMA the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves .PERIOD 
Traditional notions of management are great .PERIOD If you want compliance .PERIOD 
A few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next <NUM> hours and work on anything you want ,COMMA as long as it's not part of your regular job .PERIOD 
And then being australians ,COMMA everybody has a beer .PERIOD 
That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed .PERIOD 
They have autonomy over their time ,COMMA their task ,COMMA their team ,COMMA their technique .PERIOD 
Autonomy ,COMMA mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks ,COMMA and who wins .PERIOD 
Three ,COMMA the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments .PERIOD But that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .PERIOD 
So this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the earth .PERIOD 
It turns once per day in synchrony with the earth .PERIOD 
This would be grown ,COMMA i suppose ,COMMA with nanotechnology in the future .PERIOD Sometime .PERIOD 
So if we could roll the next film ,COMMA here .PERIOD 
This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .PERIOD 
The idea of this air genie is ,COMMA it's something that can just transform and become anything .PERIOD 
And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this .PERIOD 
Um .PERIOD He was happy .PERIOD 
Let's see somebody else ,COMMA a great conductor .PERIOD 
He's a nice guy .PERIOD He's a really nice guy .PERIOD 
It's not true when he was a young man of about <NUM> .PERIOD He wrote what he called the ten commandments for conductors .PERIOD 
The first one was ,COMMA if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .PERIOD 
Now either he is senile ,COMMA and doesn't remember his own music .PERIOD Because he wrote the music .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA no ,COMMA he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control .PERIOD 
Once like ,COMMA a muti and you'll -- -- clap ,COMMA just once .PERIOD 
And then like karajan :COLON let's see what happens .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
And when karajan is asked about it ,COMMA he actually says ,COMMA yes .PERIOD The worst damage i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction .PERIOD 
Well it is different ,COMMA but isn't that controlling ,COMMA in the same way .PERIOD 
Look at the eyes .PERIOD 
And you're playing a painful sound .PERIOD 
Now it's a reversed thing .PERIOD You're telling the story ,COMMA and you're telling the story .PERIOD 
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model ,COMMA and moderating what comes in at one end ,COMMA and moderating the outputs at the other end .PERIOD 
If you could help me with that ,COMMA it would be fantastic .PERIOD 
It's open source .PERIOD It's something which everybody who's involved with .PERIOD It develops and passes on as they work with it .PERIOD 
It's self-organizing .PERIOD There is no great central organization that pushes this .PERIOD People just pick up an idea ,COMMA and they run with it ,COMMA and they implement it where they are .PERIOD 
And it's really about how systems ,COMMA settlements ,COMMA withstand shock from the outside .PERIOD 
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them ,COMMA at any one time ,COMMA often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .PERIOD 
It's a process which is playful and creative and informative .PERIOD 
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .PERIOD 
A lot of places are working with their local schools .PERIOD 
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .PERIOD 
And we see it all over the place as well .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .PERIOD 
Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .PERIOD 
Now how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .PERIOD 
And california's not unique .PERIOD 
There's ways if it's temporary ,COMMA to minimize the impact ,COMMA but it's a problem .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you have to allocate dollars for that system ,COMMA and for that incentive pay .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there really is no brain trust .PERIOD 
So what do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Whenever they say ,COMMA there's these long-term problems ,COMMA we can't say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're the messenger with bad news .PERIOD 
Now i think this is a solvable problem .PERIOD 
What do i know that would cause me ,COMMA a reticent ,COMMA midwestern scientist ,COMMA to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting .PERIOD 
Did it mean that venus had an ionosphere .PERIOD 
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .PERIOD 
Its changes will affect all of humanity .PERIOD 
British physicist ,COMMA john tyndall .PERIOD In the <NUM>'s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation ,COMMA which is heat .PERIOD 
Most of the things mentioned in our <NUM> paper were facts .PERIOD 
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force .PERIOD 
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first from earth's energy balance and second from earth's climate history .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA finally we can measure earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in earth's heat reservoirs .PERIOD 
The biggest reservoir ,COMMA the ocean ,COMMA was the least well measured ,COMMA until more than <NUM> .PERIOD Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean .PERIOD 
Yet there was more energy coming in than going out .PERIOD 
These curves for global temperature ,COMMA atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores ,COMMA from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over <NUM> years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .PERIOD 
And more co2 causes more warming .PERIOD 
So co2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge .PERIOD Even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .PERIOD 
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .PERIOD 
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .PERIOD 
What may be more reprehensible ?QUESTIONMARK If climate denial continues ,COMMA is extermination of species .PERIOD 
An important impact ,COMMA if global warming continues ,COMMA will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world ,COMMA the midwest and great plains ,COMMA which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts ,COMMA worse than the dust bowl within ;SEMICOLON just a few decades .PERIOD If we let global warming continue .PERIOD 
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .PERIOD 
A parachute jump from the very edge of space .PERIOD 
What i'd like to do first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before .PERIOD 
I'm a stunt coordinator and as well as perform stunts .PERIOD I often design them .PERIOD 
What safety they had was very scant .PERIOD 
This is the first stunt woman ,COMMA rosie venger ,COMMA an amazing woman .PERIOD 
Yakima ;SEMICOLON canutt really formed the stunt fight .PERIOD 
Talking of dangerous stunts ,COMMA and bringing things slightly up to date ,COMMA some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we used to use trampettes in the old days .PERIOD That's all they had .PERIOD 
And that's a ramp spring off the thing and fly through the air .PERIOD And hopefully you make it look good .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we've got technology .PERIOD This thing is called an air ram .PERIOD 
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology .PERIOD 
That's a long way to fall .PERIOD If you get it wrong .PERIOD That was just about right .PERIOD 
This is a shot of terminator ,COMMA the movie .PERIOD 
It's <NUM> feet .PERIOD It's water .PERIOD It's very simple .PERIOD 
This guy is not skydiving .PERIOD He's being flown like a kite ,COMMA or moved around like a kite .PERIOD 
It's that shape ,COMMA because the helium has to expand .PERIOD 
Certainly at <NUM> feet .PERIOD No aircraft will fly .PERIOD 
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps and two balloons for the main jump ,COMMA because they notoriously tear on takeoff .PERIOD 
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down .PERIOD 
It's hundreds of feet high .PERIOD It's enormous .PERIOD 
It's a three sided box ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
That's the prototype of the parachute .PERIOD I've now had them custom ,COMMA make one ,COMMA the only one of its kind in the world .PERIOD And that's the only suit of its kind in the world .PERIOD 
Then they're comfortable .PERIOD They have good vision ,COMMA like this great big visor .PERIOD 
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming ,COMMA back ,COMMA down in whatever emergency measures ,COMMA everyone is okay .PERIOD 
But if you are and you say to somebody ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they say ,COMMA what do you do .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA religion and money and other things .PERIOD 
What you have ,COMMA there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent .PERIOD And my contention is ,COMMA all kids have tremendous talents .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD So <NUM> minutes left .PERIOD 
And the girl said ,COMMA i'm drawing a picture of god .PERIOD 
He was in the nativity play .PERIOD 
You may have seen it nativity ii ,COMMA but james got the part of joseph ,COMMA which we were thrilled about .PERIOD 
We had the place crammed full of agents in t-shirts .PERIOD James robinson is joseph .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down .PERIOD And the first boy said ,COMMA i bring you gold .PERIOD 
And the third boy said frank sent this .PERIOD 
They have become frightened of being wrong .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why is this .PERIOD 
You don't think of shakespeare ,COMMA having a father .PERIOD Do you .PERIOD 
Shakespeare ,COMMA being seven ,COMMA i never thought of it .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA he was seven at some point .PERIOD He was in somebody's english class .PERIOD Wasn't he ?QUESTIONMARK How annoying would that be ?QUESTIONMARK 
And stop speaking like that .PERIOD It's confusing ,COMMA everybody .PERIOD 
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance .PERIOD There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
We all have bodies .PERIOD Don't we ?QUESTIONMARK Did i miss a meeting .PERIOD 
And i like university professors ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .PERIOD 
Benign advice -- now ,COMMA profoundly mistaken .PERIOD The whole world is engulfed in a revolution .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA intelligence is dynamic .PERIOD 
It's really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of .PERIOD She's called gillian lynne -- have you heard of her some have ;SEMICOLON she's a choreographer ,COMMA and everybody knows her work .PERIOD 
I grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait syria ,COMMA egypt used laughter to unite the region ,COMMA just as football .PERIOD Can .PERIOD 
Also three guys working for years in los angeles ,COMMA an iranian a palestinian ,COMMA and an egyptian created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act .PERIOD 
Who had started a successful new tribe .PERIOD 
I invited our new ceo .PERIOD And as soon as he realized ,COMMA we had a room packed full of laughing infidels .PERIOD His reaction was very simple :COLON let's make this happen .PERIOD 
Stay away from bolitics in the middle east .PERIOD 
Now were the axis successful .PERIOD 
Anywhere ,COMMA you go .PERIOD 
We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel .PERIOD 
For inspiration go to one of our festivals ,COMMA go online ,COMMA drop us .PERIOD A line .PERIOD 
As my father likes to call him asheikh azubare ,COMMA as my mother would say shakespeare .PERIOD 
And i'm not a trained academic .PERIOD 
It was very difficult ,COMMA not to get scared ,COMMA not to get daunted .PERIOD 
We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school ,COMMA sent to college ,COMMA and get them prepared for better living .PERIOD A high value job .PERIOD 
That was our first school .PERIOD One hundred sixty-five children .PERIOD 
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak english .PERIOD Well .PERIOD 
Even if it takes me four and a half hours or three and half hours to finish my book ,COMMA i do it .PERIOD 
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back ,COMMA most times sober ,COMMA we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress .PERIOD 
Art :COLON music are considered therapy and mediums of expression .PERIOD 
We didn't hire mckinsey to do a business plan .PERIOD 
He comes for a tummy rub ,COMMA because he believes that will give me luck .PERIOD 
I promise you ,COMMA parusharam ,COMMA will speak in the ted conference a few years from now .PERIOD 
I think i was supposed to talk about my new book ,COMMA which is called blink ,COMMA and it's about snap judgments and first impressions .PERIOD 
So i decided ,COMMA instead ,COMMA i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last <NUM> years .PERIOD A man who is a great personal hero of mine ,COMMA someone by the name ,COMMA of howard moskowitz ,COMMA who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .PERIOD 
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago ,COMMA back in the early '70s -- one of his first clients ,COMMA was pepsi .PERIOD 
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he would think it through and say ,COMMA what was wrong .PERIOD 
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi .PERIOD 
This was his horseradish .PERIOD He was obsessed with it .PERIOD 
You'd have a plate of spaghetti ,COMMA and you would pour it on right .PERIOD 
And of those three facts .PERIOD The third one was the most significant .PERIOD Because at the time ,COMMA in the early 1980s ,COMMA if you went to a supermarket ,COMMA you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .PERIOD 
And prego turned to howard .PERIOD And they said ,COMMA you telling me that one third of americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce ;SEMICOLON and yet no one is servicing their needs .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
It's a mystery .PERIOD 
What percentage of you actually like a dark ,COMMA rich ,COMMA hearty roast .PERIOD 
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .PERIOD 
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .PERIOD 
And where did that come from ?QUESTIONMARK It came from italy .PERIOD 
When we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s .PERIOD We talked about italian tomato sauce .PERIOD We talked about the earliest ragus ,COMMA which had no visible solids ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA a and b .PERIOD We thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA then they would embrace it .PERIOD 
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .PERIOD 
And for that ,COMMA we owe him a great vote of thanks .PERIOD 
And the example he used was coffee .PERIOD 
But to us ,COMMA he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal .PERIOD 
And i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook .PERIOD 
Or even the people who actually pulled it off the people .PERIOD At bolt beranek and newman in boston ,COMMA who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network ,COMMA and sketching things on the back of napkins .PERIOD And on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard ,COMMA johnson's -- on route <NUM> in lexington ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA just two miles from where i was studying the queen's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight &amp ;SEMICOLON the pips singing midnight train to georgia while -- -- in my dad's big easy chair .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
Another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .PERIOD 
These are four very different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD I even gave them names .PERIOD 
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics .PERIOD 
This was even before the web .PERIOD 
And so what they would do is they'd have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages .PERIOD And they would introduce all this sound and motion .PERIOD 
The distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny .PERIOD The penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan <NUM> to nine lives .PERIOD It's all the same .PERIOD 
So i had all these notions .PERIOD This was back in the late '90s ,COMMA and other people in my business thought ,COMMA i was pretty crazy .PERIOD But a lot of people then went on and actually did it .PERIOD 
I just want to get to the last panel .PERIOD 
Talk about your infinite canvas .PERIOD 
Why is this important .PERIOD 
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in .PERIOD 
Thank you for having me .PERIOD 
♫ strung in the wind i called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ♫ ♫ and you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫ ♫ and i have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers .PERIOD ♫ ♫ oh ,COMMA i have been too rich for you ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north ,COMMA i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ the sea ,COMMA it freezes over ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ and i'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one .PERIOD ♫ ♫ in gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ and all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ,COMMA no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north ,COMMA i get so cold ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ,COMMA no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ,COMMA i'll believe it ♫ thank you very much .PERIOD 
And as great as these books were ,COMMA you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .PERIOD 
And that's when i discovered comedy .PERIOD 
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing ,COMMA and ultimately being in the world .PERIOD 
Because that's what i take from the theme of this conference gained in translation .PERIOD 
Now i'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that .PERIOD 
Now that's honesty and integrity ,COMMA and it's also why fey's performances left such a lasting impression .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA whether this says more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart's viewers ,COMMA the larger point remains that stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform .PERIOD It's not .PERIOD 
His intent is to be funny .PERIOD 
And just like that ,COMMA you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something ,COMMA because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .PERIOD 
Because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military ,COMMA get married and start a family .PERIOD 
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy .PERIOD 
How about that ?QUESTIONMARK How about we create a better world for nothing .PERIOD 
And not long after that ,COMMA he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california ,COMMA who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change .PERIOD In sacramento .PERIOD Last year .PERIOD 
And i think that if you're not ,COMMA there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you're in .PERIOD If you're a designer .PERIOD 
Being serious is hard .PERIOD 
Serious design .PERIOD Serious play is something else .PERIOD 
Now i always saw design careers like surreal staircases .PERIOD 
And as you get older and more decrepit ,COMMA you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase ,COMMA leading you into oblivion .PERIOD 
There's a paul newman movie that i love called the verdict .PERIOD 
This is the case .PERIOD There are no other cases .PERIOD 
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play .PERIOD 
There was no format .PERIOD 
I lived and breathed it in a way .PERIOD I haven't with a client since .PERIOD 
It enabled me to really express myself and grow .PERIOD 
But something happened to it .PERIOD And what happened to it was it became very popular .PERIOD 
Here's an ad in the new york times .PERIOD Somebody did for a play called mind games .PERIOD 
I'd never done this kind of work before .PERIOD 
This is symphony space on 90th street and broadway ,COMMA and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics .PERIOD 
And it was serious play .PERIOD 
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously .PERIOD 
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play .PERIOD And it started to ,COMMA once again ,COMMA become solemn .PERIOD 
And then i spent a year going to long ,COMMA tedious ,COMMA boring meetings ,COMMA trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .PERIOD 
Here's the united states .PERIOD 
And there are some brilliant linguists .PERIOD Mostly russians .PERIOD Who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow ,COMMA and i would love to see where that leads .PERIOD 
You may just know more about everything than anyone .PERIOD 
It was a big idea ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data trends and other information regarding the globe .PERIOD On this sphere .PERIOD 
We can use leds .PERIOD 
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display ,COMMA my father and i are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .PERIOD 
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis ,COMMA it will create a disc of light that we can control .PERIOD 
That's nothing new .PERIOD That's a propeller clock .PERIOD That's the rims that you can buy for your car .PERIOD 
Now as we continue to tinker with the oceans ,COMMA more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals ,COMMA like jellyfish and bacteria .PERIOD 
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on .PERIOD This poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there ,COMMA a by-the-wind sailor .PERIOD 
It reaches up to almost <NUM> pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish ,COMMA primarily .PERIOD 
They like to sunbathe ,COMMA can't blame them .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you look at sharks ,COMMA and they're streamlined ,COMMA and they're sleek ,COMMA and you look at tuna ,COMMA and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda .PERIOD They're about migration and strength .PERIOD And then you look at the sunfish .PERIOD 
And this is just so elegantly mysterious .PERIOD It's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say ,COMMA a tuna .PERIOD 
And from that little egg ,COMMA they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage ,COMMA reminiscent of their ancestry .PERIOD And develop -- this is their little adolescent stage .PERIOD 
That's a little diver up there in the corner .PERIOD 
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world .PERIOD 
And it's pictured right here that little tag up there .PERIOD 
But they have <NUM> genera of parasites ,COMMA and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem .PERIOD 
So what are we trying to find out ?QUESTIONMARK We're focusing on the pacific .PERIOD 
We're tagging on the california coast ,COMMA and we're tagging over in taiwan and japan .PERIOD

But not to create the engineering colleges .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can find through your jeep ,COMMA a camel ,COMMA and a cart .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So the ponds ,COMMA the open bodies ,COMMA are everywhere ,COMMA right from sri ,COMMA lanka to kashmir .PERIOD And in other parts ,COMMA also .PERIOD 
And these [unclear] which stored water ,COMMA there are two type of things .PERIOD 
It was never popular with many political leaders ,COMMA especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't .PERIOD 
And they are building what i call the spinternet .PERIOD 
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek ,COMMA which is elude the cat in chinese slang ,COMMA with other inmates ,COMMA and hit his head against the wall ,COMMA which was not an explanation ,COMMA which sat well ,COMMA with many chinese bloggers .PERIOD 
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments .PERIOD 
And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states ,COMMA and in their cyberspace .PERIOD 
And first ,COMMA it's quite simple .PERIOD 
So from this perspective ,COMMA having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great .PERIOD 
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums ,COMMA having them participate in decision making .PERIOD It's actually great .PERIOD 
And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence .PERIOD 
I mean kgb ,COMMA and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data .PERIOD 
Now it's all available online .PERIOD 
So what should we do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why are you crying .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA the boy said to me -- the boy said to me ,COMMA it would destroy me .PERIOD 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .PERIOD 
His father wasn't on the set .PERIOD 
We all looked up to him .PERIOD 
She's what i know today to be mentally ill ,COMMA higher-functioning at times than others .PERIOD 
So when i go in the room ,COMMA i close the door .PERIOD 
Now i say this all with remorse ,COMMA and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time .PERIOD But i was conflicted ,COMMA because ,COMMA while i was feeling remorse ,COMMA i was excited ,COMMA because i didn't get caught .PERIOD 
I need you working with me and me ,COMMA working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating ,COMMA that it's okay to have feelings and emotions ,COMMA that it's okay to promote equality ,COMMA that it's okay to have women who are just friends .PERIOD And that's it that it's okay to be whole ,COMMA that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .PERIOD 
Indeed :COLON what worries me is the entire notion of world .PERIOD Leadership seems to me terribly archaic .PERIOD 
It's redolent of james bond movies and kipling ,COMMA ballads .PERIOD 
And in the information era ,COMMA we all live in today .PERIOD What we might call the ted age .PERIOD I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of internet news ,COMMA of televised images ,COMMA of cellphone videos ,COMMA of email gossip .PERIOD 
We've been selling <NUM> million cellphones a month .PERIOD 
They had to suspend functions at <NUM> .PERIOD 
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine tulsi .PERIOD Zindabad long .PERIOD Live tulsi .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA legend has is that when doubting thomas the apostle ,COMMA saint thomas landed on the shores of kerala ,COMMA my home state ,COMMA somewhere around <NUM> ad ,COMMA he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing jewish girl .PERIOD 
But the fact is that the last elections ,COMMA five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of italian origin and roman catholic faith sonia gandhi ,COMMA who then made way for a sikh ,COMMA mohan singh to be sworn in as prime minister .PERIOD By a muslim president abdul kalam ,COMMA in a country ,COMMA <NUM> percent hindu .PERIOD 
All the others have been all those three .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you can't even take the name of the country for granted .PERIOD Because the name ,COMMA india comes from the river .PERIOD Indus which flows in pakistan .PERIOD 
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land ,COMMA emerging from an ancient civilization ,COMMA united by a shared history ,COMMA but sustained ,COMMA above all ,COMMA by pluralist democracy .PERIOD 
Now that is the india that is emerging into the 21st century .PERIOD 
And i mean ,COMMA the world apparently is running out too .PERIOD 
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves ,COMMA attached to certain specific target zones :COLON bacteria that we don't like .PERIOD 
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like like ,COMMA staphylococcus -- i don't like it in particular ,COMMA because it killed a professor friend of mine .PERIOD Last year .PERIOD 
So this was pretty shocking to me that we could do this .PERIOD 
And there's the very important thing there .PERIOD If you want to survive the cold ,COMMA you ought to be suspended right .PERIOD 
The highest concentration is in our brains .PERIOD 
And so we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold ,COMMA and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal .PERIOD 
So we wondered ,COMMA can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility .PERIOD 
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal .PERIOD 
And this company ,COMMA the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine .PERIOD And the results are incredibly positive .PERIOD 
And i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low .PERIOD 
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them .PERIOD It's really confusing .PERIOD 
I’m going around the world giving talks about darwin .PERIOD And usually what i’m talking about is darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning .PERIOD 
Exactly exactly .PERIOD And it is a strange inversion .PERIOD 
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind ,COMMA you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet .PERIOD 
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t ,COMMA because if there were then mother ,COMMA nature would have a problem .PERIOD How on earth do you get chimps to mate .PERIOD 
What we see with say ,COMMA chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .PERIOD 
You’ve got <NUM> seconds ,COMMA you’d better be fast .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA lot’s of laughter .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD Exactly .PERIOD 
So we might have a wild idea ,COMMA but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else .PERIOD 
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it .PERIOD 
Now that wasn’t just self-indulgence .PERIOD 
It takes more than decor ,COMMA but i think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace that remind people to be playful ,COMMA and that it’s a permissive environment .PERIOD 
But why is it important .PERIOD 
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example .PERIOD 
So another one of bob mckim’s favorite exercises is called the <NUM> circles test .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA put down your pencils ,COMMA as they say .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD <NUM> :COLON anybody get all <NUM> .PERIOD 
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible .PERIOD 
We stop ourselves from doing things .PERIOD 
I think the eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation .PERIOD 
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war ,COMMA i think .PERIOD And from this experiment they moved on to chairs .PERIOD 
When play is about building a tower out of blocks .PERIOD The kid begins to learn a lot about towers .PERIOD 
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start ,COMMA again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play .PERIOD 
So they learned their way to that by building prototypes .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object .PERIOD 
The prototyping carts ,COMMA filled with colored paper and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff -- i mean ,COMMA they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them .PERIOD 
But by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas ,COMMA can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily .PERIOD 
We’re doing the same thing as designers .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA remember ,COMMA the sketching task we did at the beginning .PERIOD 
As designers we need to be able to transition in and out of play ,COMMA also .PERIOD 
And it doesn't take long to go downhill .PERIOD 
And i got distracted by it .PERIOD 
And suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent ,COMMA when i should have been talking to my clients .PERIOD 
My partner and i thom .PERIOD We had to let all our employees go .PERIOD 
Because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage .PERIOD 
And i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada .PERIOD 
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet ,COMMA and her voice was so pure .PERIOD 
And i had this idea :COLON if i could get <NUM> people to all do this same thing ,COMMA sing their parts -- soprano ,COMMA alto ,COMMA tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world ,COMMA post their videos to youtube .PERIOD We could cut it all together and create a virtual choir .PERIOD 
And i sent out this call to singers .PERIOD 
And i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year .PERIOD <NUM> called lux aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD 
This is evangelina ,COMMA etienne from massachusetts .PERIOD 
I was told later ,COMMA and also by lots of singers who were involved in this ,COMMA that they sometimes recorded <NUM> or <NUM> different ,COMMA takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it .PERIOD 
He scrubbed the audio .PERIOD 
And then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago .PERIOD 
We had a million hits in the first month ,COMMA and got a lot of attention for it .PERIOD 
And there were <NUM> people involved in that .PERIOD 
And we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them .PERIOD Their experience singing it .PERIOD 
My sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly .PERIOD 
Me too .PERIOD 
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as i've never been part of one .PERIOD 
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection .PERIOD 
It wasn't a virtual choir .PERIOD 
But i know myself too .PERIOD I feel this virtual esprit de corps ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA with all of them .PERIOD 
This is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of california .PERIOD 
And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage .PERIOD And i started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting ,COMMA while listening to their sounds ,COMMA to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes .PERIOD 
So we got this incredible video system .PERIOD It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film ,COMMA at extremely high speeds in low light .PERIOD 
And as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down <NUM> times .PERIOD It's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD 
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from <NUM> meters per second all the way up to <NUM> meters per second .PERIOD 
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out .PERIOD 
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe ,COMMA and the speed that we observe ,COMMA and the output of the system .PERIOD 
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface .PERIOD 
In biological systems it's important .PERIOD Not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it .PERIOD 
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA i think this will be a world record .PERIOD 
And what i'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this .PERIOD On the surface of the load cell ,COMMA as the limb comes flying through .PERIOD 
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it .PERIOD Just like these pictures show .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb .PERIOD 
Very very convenient solution to that particular problem .PERIOD 
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods .PERIOD 
And this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really ,COMMA in all species .PERIOD Their spring .PERIOD 
And so i'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force .PERIOD And something about the time period in the molting cycle .PERIOD 
We still have one foot in the dark ages .PERIOD 
Ts !EXCLAMATIONMARK Eliot really said ,COMMA it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps .PERIOD We shall not cease from exploration ,COMMA and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time .PERIOD 
It’s a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD 
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for .PERIOD 
A seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat .PERIOD Ok .PERIOD 
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere .PERIOD 
This is a three-dimensional machine .PERIOD 
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater .PERIOD 
Chris ,COMMA asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before .PERIOD 
I’m trying to do everything very gently .PERIOD 
This is the first flying machine .PERIOD This was the first prototype .PERIOD 
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently ,COMMA positively buoyant .PERIOD 
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head .PERIOD 
And so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the era of big infrastructure is over .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA albeit a very small creature and very modest .PERIOD This creature is incredible .PERIOD Because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures .PERIOD 
But you can see ,COMMA even just intuit ,COMMA from this map ,COMMA that the harbor has dredged and flattened ,COMMA and went from a rich ,COMMA three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it .PERIOD 
When we started this project ,COMMA one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .PERIOD 
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself .PERIOD 
It accepts algae and detritus in one end ,COMMA and through this beautiful glamorous set of stomach organs ,COMMA out the other end comes cleaner ,COMMA water .PERIOD 
Basically new york was built on the backs of oystermen .PERIOD And our streets were literally built over oyster shells .PERIOD 
What is fuzzy rope ?QUESTIONMARK You ask .PERIOD 
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .PERIOD 
So get your tevas on .PERIOD 
And then those spat are then seeded .PERIOD 
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA sorry -- it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting .PERIOD 
Because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better .PERIOD And -- oh ,COMMA right !EXCLAMATIONMARK We drink from the river .PERIOD 
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies ,COMMA but nothing had really stuck .PERIOD 
You can't really see it in this map ,COMMA but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book .PERIOD 
So it was this incredibly terrifying event .PERIOD 
Just an extraordinary :COLON terrifying scene .PERIOD 
And eventually snow made a map of the outbreak .PERIOD 
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods ,COMMA people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't .PERIOD But eventually ,COMMA he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see .PERIOD 
And so with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around .PERIOD 
We don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself .PERIOD Quite the way that you know ,COMMA rome did ,COMMA and be <NUM> percent of its size in <NUM> years or <NUM> years .PERIOD 
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising when the dalai lama had to leave tibet .PERIOD 
And it just so happened on the fifth week ,COMMA there was a public teaching by the dalai lama .PERIOD 
I interview and do portraits .PERIOD 
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons .PERIOD 
This is mengatoue .PERIOD 
He's the shaman of the huaorani ,COMMA and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm an older man now i'm getting tired ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm tired of spearing these oil workers .PERIOD 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there ,COMMA at the time -- and this is the little movie .PERIOD He put together about that .PERIOD 
It's a question of what's the continuity .PERIOD 
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away .PERIOD So you see it .PERIOD 
So if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion .PERIOD And the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the dark ages ,COMMA and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies .PERIOD And then later ,COMMA they get to the more expansive galaxies .PERIOD 
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies ,COMMA and the stars ,COMMA just like the foam on the ocean .PERIOD 
And just put radially they're going out that way .PERIOD 
What happens :COLON is you take pictures as the earth rotates .PERIOD You get a fan across the sky .PERIOD 
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .PERIOD 
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right .PERIOD 
So i'll show you the next movie .PERIOD 
We're going to keep zooming in ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
And so i forgot to tell you the scale .PERIOD 
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance .PERIOD 
There's a very simple fluid to begin with .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you .PERIOD 
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe ,COMMA and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK And nodes .PERIOD But you realize they're not even the main structure .PERIOD 
And we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around .PERIOD And you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the question is :COLON how hard would it be to assemble this right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so here we are .PERIOD 
This is how if you took billions of years to go around ,COMMA it might look to you right .PERIOD 
And if you could see invisible matter ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope ,COMMA plus our other instruments ,COMMA was once in a region that was smaller than an atom .PERIOD 
So i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture .PERIOD 
And at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating .PERIOD Its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .PERIOD 
The fact is that we're living longer .PERIOD 
It really involves many different areas .PERIOD 
And that's where the field is today .PERIOD 
We then grow the cells outside the body ,COMMA take the scaffold coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the strategy here is -- this is actually a ct scan an x-ray -- and we go layer by layer ,COMMA using computerized morphometric imaging analysis ,COMMA and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys .PERIOD 
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now .PERIOD 
I was able to do more things .PERIOD 
Most of my professors were all for it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA bring pictures ,COMMA and show me the clips online .PERIOD And i'm happy for you .PERIOD 
'i failed' he cried .PERIOD 
One was -- never be late ,COMMA never be late .PERIOD 
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time .PERIOD 
He spelled moriarty with only one 'i' .PERIOD 
You and i know ,COMMA deeper down .PERIOD There's always a chance to win the crown .PERIOD 
Giving all it seems to me ,COMMA is not so far from victory .PERIOD 
Don't whine don't complain don't make excuses .PERIOD 
Not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should .PERIOD And only ,COMMA you will know whether you can do that .PERIOD 
I mention in my book ,COMMA they call me coach .PERIOD 
So they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had .PERIOD 
So in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company's ,COMMA sugar rush problem .PERIOD A problem ,COMMA the economists call the coincidence of wants in approximately <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
So what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're bartering ,COMMA trading ,COMMA swapping ,COMMA sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .PERIOD 
Over the next minute you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate .PERIOD 
And we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs ,COMMA or farmed in cooperatives .PERIOD Before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms .PERIOD 
They're growing up ,COMMA sharing -- files ,COMMA video games ,COMMA knowledge .PERIOD 
Thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists ,COMMA and he poignantly commented that <NUM> is when we hit a wall .PERIOD When mother nature and the market ,COMMA both said ,COMMA no more .PERIOD 
The second is collaborative :COLON lifestyles .PERIOD 
Just think of libraries and laundrettes .PERIOD 
They are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow .PERIOD The new urban world .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA why do i say that .PERIOD 
After we finished armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool sports jacket .PERIOD And we headed out into the glare .PERIOD 
I thought they might be playing king of the hill .PERIOD But i was wrong .PERIOD 
'it's a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you .PERIOD 
Beer is a very important thing in brazil .PERIOD 
This here on the right-hand side is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel .PERIOD 
And the second aspect is that ,COMMA once you have <NUM> people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD 
My family moved .PERIOD We're nomads .PERIOD 
But these two people worked something out .PERIOD 
Right now those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year .PERIOD 
It will be well over a trillion dollars by <NUM> .PERIOD 
And the avian flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD 
You should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer’s disease .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies .PERIOD So you want to stay mentally stimulated .PERIOD 
And one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology .PERIOD 
And obviously technology had existed before then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it ,COMMA and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life .PERIOD 
And that's the very first use of the word .PERIOD 
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools .PERIOD 
So climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD 
And flowers and plants are the same thing ,COMMA extended and technology is basically an extension of life .PERIOD 
And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip .PERIOD 
And there are things moving towards greater complexity .PERIOD Moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ,COMMA ubiquity ,COMMA and most important ,COMMA evolvability ,COMMA those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD 
He could buy things that king henry in all his wealth ,COMMA could never buy .PERIOD 
And what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .PERIOD 
So better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don't like is basically better technology .PERIOD 
And so every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job .PERIOD 
And we are aware of the price .PERIOD 
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago ,COMMA is moving through us ,COMMA and it continues to go and our choice .PERIOD So to speak ,COMMA in technology ,COMMA is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .PERIOD 
I really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD I've never been so nervous -- and i do this .PERIOD When i'm nervous ,COMMA i just realized .PERIOD 
In the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope ,COMMA there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people .PERIOD 
So when i moved back to san francisco ,COMMA we rented this building .PERIOD 
So we thought we'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day .PERIOD Anyway .PERIOD Why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework .PERIOD So you have basically no border between these two communities .PERIOD 
And we looked around and somebody else said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer .PERIOD 
This is replacement eyes .PERIOD In case you lose one .PERIOD 
While you're reading the sign ,COMMA we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD 
It became mop heads ,COMMA and this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats .PERIOD And then right behind it ,COMMA we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD 
And we thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates ,COMMA they're gonna love it .PERIOD And they didn't .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's been proven that <NUM> to <NUM> hours a year with one-on-one attention .PERIOD A student can get one grade level higher .PERIOD 
But there was something psychological happening there .PERIOD That was just a little bit different .PERIOD 
They're allowed to go home at <NUM> pm .PERIOD Enjoy their family ,COMMA enjoy other hobbies .PERIOD Get outside play .PERIOD 
Then we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ?QUESTIONMARK Because it has to be used before ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> pm .PERIOD 
So this is one of the books that they do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up ,COMMA taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind .PERIOD 
It's right off the library and there we serve all <NUM> kids in this middle school .PERIOD 
You can see amy tan sponsored .PERIOD The next one i might get somewhere .PERIOD 
We sell all the student books .PERIOD 
They would say ,COMMA what is this .PERIOD 
So the store actually did really well .PERIOD 
This is sam potts' ,COMMA great design .PERIOD That did this .PERIOD 
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there .PERIOD It goes up an electric lift ;SEMICOLON and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do ,COMMA if you want to buy anything .PERIOD And it limits really their sales .PERIOD 
So then the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in .PERIOD But it slowly opens .PERIOD 
This is one of the students ,COMMA khaled .PERIOD Hamdan .PERIOD 
Came in got this concentrated attention .PERIOD 
I'm going to switch to we and not .PERIOD I hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD 
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community .PERIOD 
Hot ,COMMA studio did a great job in a very tight deadline ,COMMA so ,COMMA visit the site .PERIOD 
I've been a priest in the church for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years .PERIOD 
Suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power .PERIOD 
Acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable .PERIOD By definition .PERIOD 
And this is what i said .PERIOD 
And we want an explanation from god .PERIOD 
For hundreds of years ,COMMA the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth ,COMMA was that god ?QUESTIONMARK The father ?QUESTIONMARK The creator is unchanging and therefore ,COMMA by definition cannot feel pain or sadness .PERIOD 
And the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question ,COMMA the cold ,COMMA unfeeling god .PERIOD 
Who is god in all this .PERIOD 
Do we have a local god ,COMMA who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like <NUM> mile-per-hour waves .PERIOD 
That's just not acceptable to intelligent christians ,COMMA and we must acknowledge it .PERIOD 
You probably heard some of them :COLON the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD 
If we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely ,COMMA take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD 
Maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents .PERIOD 
The people knew their god by his mighty acts .PERIOD 
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world .PERIOD 
In the end ,COMMA we have to say ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD 
To have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe ,COMMA and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements .PERIOD 
And how would one deepen such a faith .PERIOD 
But in the end ,COMMA the only thing i could say for sure was ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD And that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all .PERIOD 
It was deep at night .PERIOD 
And i kept on staring at it until it disappeared .PERIOD 
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees ,COMMA whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face scared eyes .PERIOD 
War ,COMMA a friend of mine said ,COMMA is not about sound at all .PERIOD 
It is actually about silence ,COMMA the silence of humanity .PERIOD 
I have since left iraq and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA but it's not fair because there is only one life ,COMMA and there should only be one death .PERIOD 
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD 
How interesting .PERIOD 
There is a side that is led by men .PERIOD And there is a side that is led by women .PERIOD 
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability .PERIOD If we don't start investing in women and girls .PERIOD 
She got into women for women international's program .PERIOD 
To start with these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day .PERIOD And if they can ,COMMA who are we not to dance .PERIOD 
By accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world .PERIOD And we try to build our foundation for the world .PERIOD We're messing up the future .PERIOD Because who wants to be uncreative ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now i grew up in the '60s ,COMMA and i'll admit it ,COMMA actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned the '60s ,COMMA and i was a wannabe hippie .PERIOD And i always resented the fact that i wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD 
And i know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies ,COMMA but people talk about the '60s all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there .PERIOD But when i think about the '60s ,COMMA what i took away from it was that there was hope for the future .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA i always assumed i would go into space ,COMMA because i followed all of this ,COMMA but i also loved the arts and sciences .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out .PERIOD 
But when i went into space ,COMMA when i went into space ,COMMA i carried a number of things up with me .PERIOD I carried a poster by alvin ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out .PERIOD Now i love the dance company .PERIOD 
And yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD You literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them ,COMMA but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors ,COMMA is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there .PERIOD 
It's the universe as experienced by everyone .PERIOD And the arts manifest our desire ,COMMA our attempt to share or influence others through experiences .PERIOD That are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD 
Do ,COMMA you know these books these such and such for dummies .PERIOD 
But i was looking online at amazoncom for other books ,COMMA like this .PERIOD 
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense .PERIOD 
I was in milan last week for the italian launch .PERIOD 
So it was traumatizing ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
Modernism means white box ,COMMA and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD 
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters .PERIOD 
As a child ,COMMA we used to wake up at <NUM> am and work till <NUM> pm .PERIOD Six days a week .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
But the media lab is an interesting place .PERIOD And it's important to me because ,COMMA as a student ,COMMA i was a computer science undergrad ,COMMA and i discovered design later on in my life .PERIOD 
And there was this person ,COMMA muriel cooper .PERIOD 
It was the best advice i ever got .PERIOD So i went to art school because of her .PERIOD 
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us .PERIOD 
So if you sort of compare that like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human -- i've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .PERIOD 
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff .PERIOD 
Lots of complex stuff .PERIOD 
This is a floral theme calendar in <NUM> .PERIOD And this is a firework calendar .PERIOD So you launch the number into space .PERIOD Because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason .PERIOD 
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things .PERIOD And so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes .PERIOD 
And eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD But what could that be eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i went back to the computer ,COMMA and i bought five large fries ,COMMA and scanned them all .PERIOD And i was looking for some kind of food theme ,COMMA and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images .PERIOD 
And also as a child ,COMMA i was the fattest kid in class .PERIOD So i used to love cheetos .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA i love cheetos ,COMMA yummy .PERIOD 
I discovered that cheetos are good ,COMMA expressive material .PERIOD 
It's a strange business model .PERIOD I can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte .PERIOD 
In japan ,COMMA they say that sushi is challenging .PERIOD 
This book i wrote ,COMMA because i want to figure out life .PERIOD 
He's an expert in aging .PERIOD This horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old ,COMMA twenty-four years old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data .PERIOD So brain strength increases up to <NUM> ,COMMA and then after <NUM> ,COMMA it sort of goes down kind of depressing .PERIOD In a way .PERIOD 
Your social responsibility is very interesting .PERIOD 
How dare we be ?QUESTIONMARK Optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK 
But as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws .PERIOD 
And there are lots of those .PERIOD But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global ,COMMA or strategic conflict .PERIOD 
Greenland remains twenty-eight years ago .PERIOD This is what the polar ice cap -- the north polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer .PERIOD At the fall ,COMMA equinox .PERIOD 
This last fall ,COMMA i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder ,COMMA colorado and talked to the researchers here in monterey .PERIOD At the naval ,COMMA postgraduate ,COMMA laboratory .PERIOD 
The north polar ice ,COMMA cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states ,COMMA minus an area ,COMMA roughly equal to the state of arizona .PERIOD 
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .PERIOD 
What is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD 
Nbc -- i'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for nbc asked <NUM> questions in <NUM> of the presidential candidates .PERIOD Two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD Abc <NUM> :COLON questions :COLON two about the climate crisis .PERIOD 
This is gasoline consumption ,COMMA in all of these countries ,COMMA and us .PERIOD 
We have the technologies .PERIOD 
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this :COLON the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions ,COMMA all has a single ,COMMA very simple solution .PERIOD 
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .PERIOD 
Lot of other things contributed to it .PERIOD But the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change australia's position on kyoto .PERIOD And he has .PERIOD Now they came to an awareness ,COMMA partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .PERIOD 
But we have a planetary emergency .PERIOD 
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the iraq war ,COMMA we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .PERIOD 
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .PERIOD 
Demand -- change the light bulbs ,COMMA but change ,COMMA the laws change .PERIOD The global treaties .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale .PERIOD But i do believe that between now and november .PERIOD It is possible .PERIOD 
In terms of your own personal role going forward .PERIOD Al :COLON is there something more than that ?QUESTIONMARK You would like to be doing .PERIOD 
Al gore :COLON thank you so much for coming to ted .PERIOD 
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project .PERIOD 
All this noise around us actually has information .PERIOD 
So what i started thinking was ,COMMA perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .PERIOD 
So we started doing this ,COMMA and you can see here on the horizontal axis .PERIOD You've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .PERIOD 
You take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise .PERIOD And out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way ,COMMA attacks are ordered in this conflict .PERIOD 
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines ,COMMA but the slope of these lines ,COMMA they clustered around this value of alpha equals <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack .PERIOD 
This is data statistics .PERIOD What does it tell us about these conflicts .PERIOD 
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .PERIOD 
So what's going on .PERIOD 
Why should these different ?QUESTIONMARK -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns .PERIOD 
What does it look like .PERIOD 
We can push it up the forces become more fragmented .PERIOD There is more of them .PERIOD But they are weaker .PERIOD 
The opposite happened .PERIOD 
The groups became stronger .PERIOD 
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them ,COMMA so that we can use them .PERIOD 
You work over different time zones ,COMMA you talk to very different people ,COMMA you multitask ,COMMA we all know it .PERIOD And we do .PERIOD It kind of automatically .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers .PERIOD Just like designers are seeking scientists .PERIOD 
And :COLON keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others .PERIOD 
And it was great .PERIOD Because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't know what style is .PERIOD I'm not really elegant .PERIOD 
Paul !EXCLAMATIONMARK Steinhardt ,COMMA a physicist from new york and aranda/lasch architects ,COMMA collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine .PERIOD 
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now .PERIOD Just to give you a taste of it .PERIOD 
In this case i'm showing more the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated .PERIOD 
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty .PERIOD 
When you don't have to kill cows ,COMMA and it can have any shape ,COMMA what should it be like .PERIOD 
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today .PERIOD We can look at it from many ,COMMA many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels .PERIOD 
One of the most interesting and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD We change scale very often .PERIOD We change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it .PERIOD We do it very comfortably .PERIOD 
You can be in the subway ,COMMA and you can be completely isolated ,COMMA and have your own room in your ipod .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other ,COMMA if they detect that particular smell that signifies ,COMMA in this case pregnancy .PERIOD 
Design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor ,COMMA that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD 
And usually they are accompanied by videos .PERIOD 
It's quite amazing .PERIOD How these things can make you smile ?QUESTIONMARK Can make you laugh ,COMMA can make .PERIOD You cry ,COMMA sometimes .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
The only trouble is the people next door .PERIOD I can't stand them .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA i wouldn't be doing my job -- because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen .PERIOD That practicalities are seen to .PERIOD 
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .PERIOD 
Therefore there should be justice throughout the world .PERIOD 
So like snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors .PERIOD 
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds .PERIOD But not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity .PERIOD 
What does this compassion entail .PERIOD 
And as many people do ,COMMA he was dozing off during the sermon .PERIOD 
And he rushed home and after the sabbath ,COMMA he made <NUM> loaves of bread ,COMMA took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark .PERIOD And said ,COMMA god ,COMMA i don't know why you want this bread .PERIOD But here you are .PERIOD 
And he called the two of them to his office .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA mean ,COMMA god ,COMMA didn't want my bread .PERIOD 
And the rabbi said ,COMMA you've misunderstood me .PERIOD 
You've misunderstood totally .PERIOD He said .PERIOD 
Please .PERIOD Keep your seat .PERIOD 
Wrap it in an ace bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two .PERIOD And that's the end of the story .PERIOD 
How can the nervous system ,COMMA get this ?QUESTIONMARK So wrong .PERIOD 
In your house ,COMMA wires run in the wall ,COMMA from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling ,COMMA and from the junction box to the light bulb .PERIOD 
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls ,COMMA so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on .PERIOD Or your computer monitor turned off .PERIOD 
If you look out your window and you can see long's peak ,COMMA you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD 
Take meeker mt ,COMMA meeker lump that in there and put that in space as well and mt .PERIOD Everest and k2 ,COMMA and the indian peaks .PERIOD 
Because back ,COMMA then video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them .PERIOD Parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD And since this came in on a friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina ,COMMA maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york .PERIOD 
This did a huge amount of damage .PERIOD 
The one over tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly ,COMMA so it blew up in the air either way .PERIOD These are tremendous explosions ,COMMA <NUM> megatons .PERIOD 
I don't think apophis is a problem .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA apophis is a blessing in disguise .PERIOD Because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA let me ask you .PERIOD What happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK You do this .PERIOD 
I think even nasa can do that ,COMMA and they proved that they can .PERIOD 
After the big macho ?QUESTIONMARK Rrrrrrr .PERIOD Bam .PERIOD We're gonna hit this thing in the face .PERIOD Then we bring in the velvet gloves .PERIOD 
There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts ,COMMA and they call themselves the b612 foundation .PERIOD For those of you who've read the little prince ,COMMA you understand that reference .PERIOD I hope the little prince who lived on an asteroid .PERIOD It was called b612 .PERIOD 
So think about this right .PERIOD 
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent <NUM> percent ,COMMA i think ,COMMA should enjoy it until it lasts .PERIOD 
My story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in <NUM> .PERIOD 
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ,COMMA because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD 
So here we are having our first client brilliant .PERIOD 
It's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way ,COMMA how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .PERIOD 
And we said ,COMMA that's fine ,COMMA let's meet .PERIOD You'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did .PERIOD 
We start the meeting .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA however ,COMMA you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense .PERIOD 
We were the best that they could do .PERIOD 
We do it in <NUM> countries of the developing world .PERIOD 
So what the governor got was an empty shell .PERIOD 
So from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify .PERIOD 
Imagine two thirds over here ,COMMA running excellent organizations ,COMMA doing very important work .PERIOD 
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear ,COMMA and switch the lights off .PERIOD 
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform ,COMMA to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD 
And then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds .PERIOD 
So indeed ,COMMA i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive .PERIOD 
So since i tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i've studied to illustrate this point -- abraham lincoln ,COMMA and lyndon johnson .PERIOD 
But he read books in every spare moment he could find .PERIOD 
Three things had combined to lay him low .PERIOD 
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal .PERIOD 
And his great friend speed went to his side and said ,COMMA lincoln ,COMMA you must rally or you will die .PERIOD 
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD 
Knowing that ,COMMA tolstoy was in their midst .PERIOD They asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD 
But instead ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA bring her down here for a year .PERIOD And if i can't win her over ,COMMA no one can .PERIOD 
But they were great ,COMMA nonetheless .PERIOD 
But i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman .PERIOD 
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings .PERIOD 
And the british people were still upset about losing the revolution .PERIOD So they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse ,COMMA where he'd have to encounter it .PERIOD 
Which allows me ,COMMA from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall ,COMMA to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .PERIOD 
But it so happened ,COMMA he was speaking in a protestant church .PERIOD 
So i went to my father in tears ,COMMA what are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others ,COMMA being mean to my sisters .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD 
There are lots of people who believe that .PERIOD And i think it is utter baloney .PERIOD 
I think that's the main point to be made .PERIOD 
And i won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD 
And in a lot of familiar cases they ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are .PERIOD 
So it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD And in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws .PERIOD 
You know what it means .PERIOD A circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD 
Maxwell's equations are of course .PERIOD Symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD 
The next -- second -- equation ,COMMA says that there is no magnetism other than that .PERIOD 
So here we say ,COMMA again what we said before that ,COMMA each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely ,COMMA concise way .PERIOD 
Steps toward unification ,COMMA exhibit the simplicity .PERIOD 
Symmetry ,COMMA exhibits the simplicity .PERIOD 
Now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind .PERIOD 
They are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD 
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more .PERIOD 
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents .PERIOD 
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us .PERIOD 
We perish ,COMMA they survive ,COMMA we have one life ,COMMA they have many lives .PERIOD And in each life they can mean different things .PERIOD 
The central element ,COMMA still of the notion of return .PERIOD A central part of the life of judaism .PERIOD 
All of those are respected by cyrus .PERIOD 
It left a dream of the middle east as a unit ,COMMA and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .PERIOD 
For them ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it can't possibly by marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD 
And it's quite clear .PERIOD The cylinder is older than the text of isaiah .PERIOD And yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .PERIOD 
The state of israel is setup ,COMMA and <NUM> years later in the late 60s ,COMMA it's clear that britain's role as the imperial power is over .PERIOD 
It's shown being presented here ,COMMA put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in iran in very senior positions .PERIOD Mrs .PERIOD Ardakani .PERIOD 
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means ,COMMA but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- cyrus as the defender of the homeland .PERIOD The champion ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples tolerant of all faiths .PERIOD 
Will ,COMMA iran ,COMMA set free ,COMMA the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated .PERIOD 
A replica of this is at the united nations .PERIOD 
But i think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing .PERIOD The cyrus cylinder .PERIOD 
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA i have got qualifications .PERIOD 
So i started thinking about peace ,COMMA and i was obviously ,COMMA as i said to ,COMMA you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that .PERIOD 
Could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on .PERIOD 
And that was when i had the idea .PERIOD 
There was no day of global unity .PERIOD 
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september ,COMMA as the date of peace .PERIOD 
Could you give me a flight ,COMMA because we're going to go see him .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA we went and saw him ,COMMA and it was amazing .PERIOD 
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing ,COMMA and really empowering actually .PERIOD 
And we were listening to everybody .PERIOD 
And working with ngos and building this case .PERIOD 
I felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD 
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic ,COMMA and that young boy who was a child soldier ,COMMA who told me he'd killed people -- he was about <NUM> -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop .PERIOD 
If this is the only film that i ever make ,COMMA i'm going to document ,COMMA until this becomes a reality .PERIOD 
The costa rican government ,COMMA and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with <NUM> co-sponsors .PERIOD The idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day ,COMMA the 21st of september ,COMMA as a fixed calendar date .PERIOD And it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD 
And as i mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the globe .PERIOD And there was no press .PERIOD 
It's been created .PERIOD Nobody knows .PERIOD 
But we have to continue this journey ,COMMA and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work .PERIOD 
And after lots and lots of meetings ,COMMA obviously i'm delighted that this man ahmad ,COMMA fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors really .PERIOD He managed to get unicef involved .PERIOD 
And i saw him because he was an actor .PERIOD I was an actor .PERIOD I had a connection to him ,COMMA because we needed to get to the press ,COMMA we needed this attraction .PERIOD We needed the media to be involved .PERIOD 
Because if we start pumping it up a bit ,COMMA maybe more people would listen .PERIOD And there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested .PERIOD 
I won't go into that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA jude said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll do some statements for you .PERIOD 
And i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .PERIOD 
So these guys were absolutely crucial .PERIOD 
This amazing woman ,COMMA fatima gailani ,COMMA was absolutely instrumental in what went on .PERIOD As she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .PERIOD 
And her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD 
We will observe this day .PERIOD 
We see it as a window of opportunity .PERIOD 
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .PERIOD 
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA look ,COMMA you guys made this possible ,COMMA and thank you very much .PERIOD 
And i kept thinking about this <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible ,COMMA and you couldn't do .PERIOD 
He's an amazing man .PERIOD 
It's all about the individuals .PERIOD 
And it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
There was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle -- pitch black .PERIOD 
Anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain .PERIOD 
And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone ,COMMA start all over again .PERIOD 
Now what does this have to do with leadership .PERIOD 
They are the elite .PERIOD They are our leaders .PERIOD 
And we need to train them right .PERIOD 
And one day i go to the airport to meet my father ,COMMA and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA i'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak-47 assault weapons .PERIOD 
So a few years .PERIOD After this event ,COMMA i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education .PERIOD 
They wanted us to be analytical .PERIOD 
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues .PERIOD 
It was brilliant .PERIOD 
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do .PERIOD 
Now we cannot achieve perfection .PERIOD But if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence .PERIOD 
I don't know .PERIOD Ultimately what they will do .PERIOD 
But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like ,COMMA what their excellent society should look like ,COMMA is a really good thing .PERIOD 
Now i just wanted to leave that slide up because it's important that we think about it .PERIOD 
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student .PERIOD Government .PERIOD 
It's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university .PERIOD 
It says a lot about her peers who elected her .PERIOD 
My job is to make arms and legs -- well ,COMMA it's not completely true .PERIOD 
And then not only for war victims ,COMMA but it was for any kind of patient .PERIOD 
I was also working in the orthopedic center .PERIOD We call it .PERIOD 
But it was a terrific job .PERIOD 
So the orthopedic center was closed ,COMMA because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time i make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion .PERIOD 
I wanted to go home .PERIOD I was driving .PERIOD 
And everybody disappeared from the street .PERIOD 
The man was without legs ,COMMA and only with one arm .PERIOD 
And i ask ,COMMA what are you doing out in the street in this situation .PERIOD 
And then i said ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA what did i say ?QUESTIONMARK 
He was coming every day ,COMMA crossing the front line .PERIOD 
Two groups of mujahideen started fighting .PERIOD 
So we dashed ,COMMA all of us towards the shelter .PERIOD 
Everybody was grabbing something .PERIOD 
And i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD 
I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
And then he sat down .PERIOD 
So the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise .PERIOD 
I understood that i was wrong again .PERIOD 
And then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different .PERIOD 
We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD We can't .PERIOD 
And you should see me during the match .PERIOD 
I shout like a true italian .PERIOD 
In this image of the tokyo skyline .PERIOD I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block .PERIOD The kepler mission .PERIOD 
There we go .PERIOD 
And we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with kepler and trace their effects .PERIOD 
Wrong ,COMMA i'm not looking at you .PERIOD I can't see you .PERIOD 
I have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange .PERIOD For a magician .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA they gladly sell .PERIOD You that ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead .PERIOD 
I don't think so ,COMMA because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do ,COMMA exactly the same -- the same physical methods ,COMMA the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth ,COMMA to their detriment .PERIOD 
Good bye .PERIOD 
The second question that i'd like to ask rather simple :COLON suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law .PERIOD As an example .PERIOD 
Is this a hunting game .PERIOD 
But it is a cruel ,COMMA vicious ,COMMA absolutely conscienceless -- i'll be all right ,COMMA keep your seats -- game that these people play .PERIOD 
Folks that's what dying is .PERIOD All about .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about <NUM> minutes or so .PERIOD 
We all know who he is on television .PERIOD 
He's well educated .PERIOD He's smart .PERIOD He knows what sylvia browne is doing ,COMMA but he doesn't give a damn .PERIOD 
Because the bottom line is the sponsors love it .PERIOD And he will expose her to television publicity all the time .PERIOD 
Now without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function .PERIOD 
She gives you the names of previous lives ,COMMA who you were in previous lives .PERIOD 
Duh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Nothing is ever said about a <NUM> year-old bootblack in the streets of london ,COMMA who died of consumption .PERIOD 
All the more reason to take the million dollars ,COMMA wouldn't you think ,COMMA sylvia .PERIOD 
Why don't they affect me .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor .PERIOD I'm going to give you now .PERIOD It's true .PERIOD 
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is .PERIOD They say ,COMMA the more powerful it is .PERIOD 
Largely :COLON it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing .PERIOD 
It's the bottom line ,COMMA the dollar line .PERIOD 
Now we've offered this carrot .PERIOD As i say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot .PERIOD 
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA i'm james randi and i'm waiting .PERIOD 
And one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board ,COMMA is access to safe surgery .PERIOD 
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD 
In order to operate this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months ,COMMA or even a year .PERIOD 
One of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone ,COMMA about a year ago .PERIOD 
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case .PERIOD 
And everything began pretty auspiciously .PERIOD 
My colleague dr .PERIOD Paul fenton was living this reality .PERIOD 
He went to work every day in an operating theater ,COMMA like this one ,COMMA trying to deliver anesthesia ,COMMA and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable ,COMMA and frankly unsafe in his hospital .PERIOD 
But this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen .PERIOD They see that they're giving their patient .PERIOD 
This is in <NUM> hospitals in four countries and since <NUM> we've done well over <NUM> surgeries with no clinically adverse events .PERIOD 
So we're thrilled .PERIOD 
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .PERIOD 
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal .PERIOD 
But back to animals and junk food .PERIOD 
Two ,COMMA both have been marketed heavily ,COMMA creating unnatural demand .PERIOD 
And they do this here .PERIOD It's the same deal .PERIOD 
That's just the united states .PERIOD 
There were no restaurant chains .PERIOD 
Fats ;SEMICOLON carbs ,COMMA proteins -- they weren't bad or good .PERIOD They were food .PERIOD 
The south and west became agricultural hubs .PERIOD And in other parts of the country ,COMMA suburbs took over farmland .PERIOD 
If we had a slide of salisbury steak ,COMMA even more so right .PERIOD 
Thanks to farm subsidies ,COMMA the fine collaboration between agribusiness .PERIOD And congress ,COMMA soy ,COMMA corn and cattle became king .PERIOD 
Not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there .PERIOD 
For dessert ,COMMA store-bought ice cream or cookies .PERIOD 
So now you've got your pizza nights .PERIOD You've got your microwave nights ,COMMA you've got your grazing nights .PERIOD You've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .PERIOD 
Meat :COLON junk :COLON food :COLON cheese .PERIOD The very stuff that will kill you .PERIOD 
So now we clamor for organic food .PERIOD 
I don't know .PERIOD 
Ann :COLON cooper's :COLON right .PERIOD 
The usda is not our ally here .PERIOD 
Cruelty ,COMMA i knew that the <NUM> billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we ,COMMA hypocritically ,COMMA wouldn't even consider for our own cats ,COMMA dogs and other pets .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why was i stalling ?QUESTIONMARK 
Best of all ,COMMA i'm healthier .PERIOD I know that i'm going to live longer .PERIOD And i've even lost a little weight .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging .PERIOD 
The first is -- death is a big problem .PERIOD 
Sometimes we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar ,COMMA or it's too big .PERIOD 
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died .PERIOD 
Suppose ,COMMA we approximated one person with one book .PERIOD 
So that's the first big problem .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability -- and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising .PERIOD 
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century .PERIOD <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate ,COMMA but says ,COMMA the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD 
Now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to <NUM> million lives saved ,COMMA if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation .PERIOD 
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve .PERIOD 
And even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct .PERIOD It should still have a high priority .PERIOD 
We were very successful .PERIOD 
We might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is -- i mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD 
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that ,COMMA well ,COMMA sure ,COMMA there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people .PERIOD 
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories :COLON memory :COLON concentration :COLON mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy .PERIOD 
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state .PERIOD When you're totally immersed in something you are doing .PERIOD 
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person ,COMMA undiminished through time ,COMMA so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to .PERIOD 
Might be more complicated in humans ,COMMA but perhaps not that much .PERIOD 
Well we know already that in this little human circle there ,COMMA there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful .PERIOD 
We have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space ,COMMA there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being ,COMMA perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about .PERIOD 
And so to fix this third problem ,COMMA i think we need -- slowly ,COMMA carefully ,COMMA with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there .PERIOD 
The sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about <NUM> feet to about a millimeter .PERIOD At the earth end .PERIOD 
So i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that .PERIOD 
So :COLON many forces there .PERIOD 
If i throw a very concentric circle ,COMMA or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD 
Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology ,COMMA it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA let's hope .PERIOD So .PERIOD Oh my god ,COMMA let's .PERIOD 
And i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature .PERIOD Humans are of the universe .PERIOD 
And we are expressions of the universe ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
As humans ,COMMA ultimately being part of the universe ,COMMA we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe .PERIOD 
And to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint just like an artist .PERIOD It's a good .PERIOD Ally .PERIOD 
It's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture .PERIOD 
But even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language ,COMMA a way we could communicate .PERIOD A code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows .PERIOD 
This is an origami figure -- one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only ,COMMA hundreds of folds .PERIOD 
This too is origami .PERIOD And this shows where we've gone in the modern world .PERIOD 
You can get horns ,COMMA antlers -- even if you look close ,COMMA cloven hooves .PERIOD 
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws .PERIOD It's got antennae .PERIOD Can you be that specific in the detail .PERIOD 
If i make the flaps skinnier ,COMMA i can use a bit less paper .PERIOD 
And i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .PERIOD 
Do a little more complicated instrument .PERIOD 
And he used it to design this solar array .PERIOD 
The telescope going up in space .PERIOD It unfolds in two places .PERIOD 
The design called for geosynchronous orbit <NUM> miles up .PERIOD 100-meter diameter lens .PERIOD 
And rockets are small ,COMMA so you have to make it smaller .PERIOD 
But this pattern's not going to work to get something <NUM> meters down to a few meters .PERIOD 
And they want to do their design by simulation .PERIOD 
And as weird and surprising as it may sound ,COMMA origami may someday even save a life .PERIOD 
Now ecstasy in greek meant simply to stand to the side of something .PERIOD 
You can't understand more than two people talking to you .PERIOD 
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than <NUM> years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field .PERIOD 
Whether it's mathematics or music ,COMMA it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before .PERIOD 
You see that these people define success as something that helps others ,COMMA and at the same time makes you feel happy ,COMMA as you are working at it .PERIOD 
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal .PERIOD 
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand .PERIOD 
Not a lot of women did .PERIOD 
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind .PERIOD 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in .PERIOD 
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift .PERIOD 
And so they decided because they were intrigued by this finding ,COMMA to do a nationwide survey .PERIOD 
So they spread out all the census data .PERIOD And what they found .PERIOD The guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in <NUM> out of <NUM> communities ,COMMA women ,COMMA young women ,COMMA were making more money than young men .PERIOD 
Watch what happens to the women ?QUESTIONMARK Watch what happens to the men .PERIOD 
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high .PERIOD 
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot .PERIOD 
So that's childcare ,COMMA elder care and food preparation .PERIOD 
And some people say it's because in 9th grade ,COMMA boys start dropping out of school .PERIOD 
Basically the way they said it to me is that they would be working <NUM> hours a day that their husband would maybe have a job ,COMMA but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD 
And this was kind of a shocker to me .PERIOD 
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code .PERIOD 
For one thing ,COMMA it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another .PERIOD Because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD 
So the image that i like to think of instead of glass ceiling ,COMMA is the high bridge .PERIOD 
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables .PERIOD 
To the dismay of my mother ,COMMA this is dangerous teenage fashion right there .PERIOD 
Really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful .PERIOD 
This :COLON baby is fully electric .PERIOD 
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent .PERIOD 
[but this second] grows with seven ,COMMA eight percent .PERIOD And then they will end up here .PERIOD 
They will start flying .PERIOD 
Because we already have this [growth] in process .PERIOD 
The year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
Can you see ,COMMA as the years pass by child survival is increasing .PERIOD 
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth .PERIOD 
In the front ,COMMA you see ,COMMA actually joe murray getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room ,COMMA you see hartwell harrison ,COMMA the chief of urology ,COMMA at harvard ,COMMA actually harvesting the kidney .PERIOD 
That really has to do with our aging population .PERIOD 
It's not really that foreign of a concept ,COMMA actually .PERIOD It happens on the earth every day .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA your body is constantly regenerating .PERIOD 
So how can we harness that power .PERIOD 
That's exactly what you see here .PERIOD 
To the naked eye ,COMMA they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt .PERIOD But actually ,COMMA these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body .PERIOD 
It disintegrates a few months later .PERIOD 
What about other structures .PERIOD 
This is actually an engineered blood vessel .PERIOD 
You now have your fully seeded scaffold .PERIOD 
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder .PERIOD 
We place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD 
So :COLON bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures .PERIOD 
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it .PERIOD 
We exercise these prior to implantation .PERIOD 
All we are left with is the skeleton .PERIOD If you will ,COMMA of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen ,COMMA a material that's in our bodies ,COMMA that will not reject .PERIOD 
This is still experimental ,COMMA but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure ,COMMA experimentally .PERIOD 
So another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together ,COMMA like an accordion ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
If at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs .PERIOD 
Why ,COMMA because we'd rather take those cells ,COMMA which already know that those are the cell types ,COMMA you want .PERIOD 
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors .PERIOD 
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid ,COMMA and the placenta ,COMMA which have those properties .PERIOD 
So i always like to show this cartoon .PERIOD 
And there you see the stagecoach driver and he goes on the top panel ,COMMA he goes :COLON a b ,COMMA c ,COMMA d ,COMMA e ,COMMA f .PERIOD 
Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world .PERIOD And we decide to stand up and do it .PERIOD 
And as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out .PERIOD 
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science .PERIOD What if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses .PERIOD Instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD 
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model or a singer or a sports hero like luongo .PERIOD Crosby .PERIOD 
Our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
We didn't fit in the normal work .PERIOD We couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn ,COMMA and we have all these other traits .PERIOD 
I could go on and on .PERIOD 
Fit into this other system ,COMMA and try to become a student .PERIOD 
I'm also quoted -- and i told the person who wrote the textbook -- i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian university ,COMMA and college studies .PERIOD 
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting .PERIOD 
And i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course .PERIOD 
And my mom came into the room and she said ,COMMA where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm like ,COMMA but you have two cars and they don't have license plate protectors .PERIOD 
So i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each .PERIOD 
But it was obvious to me right .PERIOD Buy low ,COMMA sell high .PERIOD 
Don't try to sell to the poor kids .PERIOD They don't have cash ,COMMA the rich people .PERIOD Do go ,COMMA get some .PERIOD 
So that's obvious ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
And making money off that too .PERIOD 
I built these little pincushions when i was <NUM> years old in cubs .PERIOD And we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother's day .PERIOD 
And you'd make these chairs .PERIOD 
You get the golf balls .PERIOD And you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks .PERIOD And when you're done ,COMMA you've got a couple hundred of them .PERIOD 
And they could use those for practice balls .PERIOD 
But it paid the bills .PERIOD 
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out in the street .PERIOD And my dad said ,COMMA go ,COMMA pick it up .PERIOD 
But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid .PERIOD 
You breed that kind of stuff .PERIOD Each of my kids has two piggy banks .PERIOD 
The <NUM> percent that goes in their house account ,COMMA every six months goes to the bank .PERIOD 
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it .PERIOD 
We have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities .PERIOD We teach kids to go get a tutor .PERIOD 
My kids love this stuff .PERIOD 
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor .PERIOD 
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities .PERIOD 
Since education under the soviet union ,COMMA was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology .PERIOD They appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women .PERIOD 
You may think ,COMMA you know what is going on in that jane austen novel -- that is ,COMMA until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism .PERIOD 
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough ,COMMA i can assure you to give one pause .PERIOD What was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable .PERIOD 
And that was only the beginning .PERIOD 
Incredibly this nation with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources ,COMMA seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas .PERIOD 
We are playing with fire .PERIOD 
On a more personal note ,COMMA this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope ,COMMA made it impossible for me to avoid the question .PERIOD What will i say years from ?QUESTIONMARK Now ,COMMA when people ask ,COMMA 'where were you' as president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history .PERIOD There were no excuses .PERIOD 
The challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD 
Even more valuable history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD 
Students in turn ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA move outside the classroom to engage the world directly .PERIOD 
This is a political education to be sure .PERIOD 
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD 
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy ,COMMA frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so ,COMMA perfect .PERIOD 
They go to church by which ,COMMA i mean they do lots of things for free for each other .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i know you don't believe me ,COMMA really here .PERIOD 
He's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content .PERIOD So i'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD 
So here he is beginning .PERIOD 
This is this fantastic ,COMMA brat pack remix set to lisztomania .PERIOD 
They decided they wanted to do the same .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at because here ,COMMA remix isn't just about an individual ,COMMA doing something alone in his basement .PERIOD It becomes an act of social creativity .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA mickey mouse himself .PERIOD Of course ,COMMA as steamboat willie is a remix of the then very dominant ,COMMA very popular steamboat bill ,COMMA by buster keaton .PERIOD 
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity .PERIOD 
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat .PERIOD 
Okay for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero ,COMMA icon on the left ,COMMA creator of this character .PERIOD 
Look at the site that he built star wars ,COMMA mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention ,COMMA towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the point is the republicans here ,COMMA recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership ,COMMA the respect we should give the creator .PERIOD The remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner ,COMMA the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff .PERIOD And not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD 
Now i think there are lessons .PERIOD We should learn here lessons about openness .PERIOD 
Our lives are sharing activities ,COMMA at least in part .PERIOD 
That's number one ,COMMA number two ,COMMA this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .PERIOD 
And number three ,COMMA we need to respect the creator .PERIOD The creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them .PERIOD 
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create ,COMMA without requiring permission first ,COMMA because the permission has already been granted ,COMMA and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright .PERIOD The creator has licensed freely .PERIOD 
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses ,COMMA as now more than <NUM> million digital objects are out there ,COMMA licensed freely in this way .PERIOD 
Now if we can learn those values from at least some influences on the right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA someone on reddit thought ,COMMA oh what a great thing .PERIOD We should all vote this up .PERIOD 
And that was that the internet loves ,COMMA mister splashy pants .PERIOD 
They even created an e-card .PERIOD So you could send your friend ,COMMA a dancing splashy .PERIOD 
There are so many great publishing tools that are available .PERIOD It only takes a few minutes of your time .PERIOD Now ,COMMA to actually produce something .PERIOD 
If you want to succeed ,COMMA you've got to be okay to just lose control .PERIOD 
Well we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing ,COMMA broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity .PERIOD But where did it all come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
Vannevar bush was the us .PERIOD Government's chief scientific adviser during the war .PERIOD 
And the memex would link information ,COMMA one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD 
He built a system .PERIOD 
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system .PERIOD 
They had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal .PERIOD The day it launched .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting .PERIOD But a guy from cern .PERIOD He's not going to do this .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA for the first time in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world -- which i think is what china will become -- will be not from the west ,COMMA and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots .PERIOD 
Now i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize .PERIOD They also westernize .PERIOD 
It will remain ,COMMA in very fundamental respects ,COMMA very different .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA china ,COMMA unlike the western states and most countries in the world ,COMMA is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence as a civilization-state ,COMMA rather than as a nation-state .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA basically the east was swallowed by the west .PERIOD 
Hence ,COMMA their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the uyghurs and to the tibetans .PERIOD 
This is the chinese view of the state -- very ,COMMA very different to ours .PERIOD 
Know that china believes in the market and the state .PERIOD 
Moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft .PERIOD 
And yet we still insist by and large ,COMMA in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience ,COMMA looking at it through western eyes ,COMMA using western concepts .PERIOD 
But it's not .PERIOD 
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position ,COMMA vis-a-vis the west -- have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west's presence in those societies .PERIOD 
Because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning ,COMMA the goldman sachs chart .PERIOD 
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA maybe that's true ,COMMA maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD 
But there's another problem which goes along with this -- that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .PERIOD 
Or take this now ,COMMA this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing .PERIOD 
Accelerometers ,COMMA on each hand read hand ,COMMA position .PERIOD 
And he was very impressed :COLON he was all tearing up ready to hug me .PERIOD 
I must have done about <NUM> caricatures .PERIOD 
That evening ,COMMA i came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this .PERIOD 
I was also asked to leave the organization ,COMMA a cartoonists' organization in america ,COMMA that ,COMMA for me ,COMMA was my lifeline .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive .PERIOD 
The collaborative effort was fabulous .PERIOD 
Since i mentioned my wife .PERIOD The most important collaboration has been with her .PERIOD Netra .PERIOD 
I must have been <NUM> and a half then .PERIOD And it was love at first sight .PERIOD 
I lived in india .PERIOD She lived in america .PERIOD 
Notice one thing we're equal here .PERIOD 
We had fashion designers ,COMMA installation artists models ,COMMA we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation .PERIOD 
And i had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD 
I could not live this larger than life person .PERIOD 
This time i said ,COMMA let's try something different .PERIOD 
And this was just eight months ago .PERIOD 
I walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl .PERIOD And she was bald .PERIOD And she was trying to hide her baldness .PERIOD 
I whipped out my pen ,COMMA and i started drawing on her head ,COMMA and i drew a crown for her .PERIOD 
Our computers ,COMMA our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today .PERIOD 
We can develop any part of the body .PERIOD 
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .PERIOD 
This would imply a massive leap in migration .PERIOD 
An individual for the first time in the history of humanity ,COMMA will have the capacity by <NUM> ,COMMA to destroy the planet ,COMMA to wreck everything ,COMMA through the creation ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen .PERIOD 
More people ,COMMA smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA i want to use zipcar .PERIOD 
And so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right .PERIOD 
Platforms are invitations .PERIOD 
So creating craigslist or itunes .PERIOD And the iphone developer network .PERIOD There are all these networks -- facebook as well .PERIOD 
Essentially there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland ,COMMA near where i live .PERIOD 
And one quick example is velib in <NUM> came forward in paris ,COMMA with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service .PERIOD 
We're at the very beginning of something that what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward ,COMMA is inviting ,COMMA it's engaging ,COMMA but it's very early .PERIOD 
You have to make a wish to save the world .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA i can't save the world .PERIOD Nobody can .PERIOD 
I know those guys .PERIOD 
It was the only one i had at that time .PERIOD 
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .PERIOD 
So we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis .PERIOD Doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver ,COMMA lawyer ,COMMA cooks .PERIOD 
The experts said ,COMMA no way .PERIOD 
We said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that's palestine .PERIOD 
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .PERIOD 
We need culture out there .PERIOD 
You see that enough in the media .PERIOD 
What i want to show is the incredible life .PERIOD 
During that time ,COMMA you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow .PERIOD 
When you look at kibera ,COMMA now they look back .PERIOD 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days ,COMMA and the photos would get revealed by themselves .PERIOD 
So we didn't get caught this time .PERIOD 
Hopefully ,COMMA you'll see the film and you'll understand the scope of the project .PERIOD And what the people felt when they saw those photos .PERIOD 
Because that's a big part of it .PERIOD There's layers behind each photo .PERIOD 
But tell me advertising for what .PERIOD 
The people i photograph were proud to participate in the project ,COMMA and to have their photo in the community .PERIOD 
The importance is ,COMMA what you do with the images ,COMMA the statement it makes where it's pasted .PERIOD 
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally .PERIOD And i pasted it in southern italy where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD 
So a subject you're passionate about ,COMMA a person who you want to tell their story ,COMMA or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .PERIOD 
Einstein's especially interested in penelope's talk .PERIOD 
A lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty .PERIOD 
Well that's really cool .PERIOD But what einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut .PERIOD 
That is one big peanut .PERIOD Since einstein is a bird .PERIOD She's very interested in things that fly .PERIOD 
E :COLON [spaceship :COLON noise] sw :COLON even if it doesn't have a laser .PERIOD 
E :COLON [squawks] sw :COLON yeah .PERIOD It sure .PERIOD Can .PERIOD But when einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public ,COMMA she loves to take in the arts .PERIOD 
Or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin .PERIOD And einstein can sing along with some opera .PERIOD 
E :COLON [operatic :COLON squawk] sw :COLON very good .PERIOD 
Or maybe stu just needs another backup singer .PERIOD 
You like to drink water .PERIOD 
Again .PERIOD 
E .PERIOD Ooooowww .PERIOD 
E :COLON goodbye .PERIOD 
And about five years ago ,COMMA we asked ,COMMA what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the uk .PERIOD 
The minister of education down south in london described himself as a big fan .PERIOD 
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour .PERIOD 
I would run into the living room ,COMMA jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out .PERIOD Because i was the incredible hulk .PERIOD 
And i would like to share my art .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA moving onward .PERIOD 
First principles :COLON this is very important .PERIOD 
I tried kickboards .PERIOD 
Hand ,COMMA paddles ,COMMA everything .PERIOD 
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion .PERIOD 
So let's look at some examples .PERIOD This is terry .PERIOD 
Rather he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm ,COMMA and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important .PERIOD 
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did ,COMMA which is going from <NUM> strokes per 20-yard length to <NUM> strokes in two workouts with no coach ,COMMA no video monitoring .PERIOD 
In freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll ,COMMA and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water .PERIOD 
Then i transferred to a different school sophomore year .PERIOD And i had a choice of other languages .PERIOD Most of my friends were taking japanese .PERIOD 
I couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world .PERIOD 
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper .PERIOD 
And that's pretty much my response .PERIOD 
Nothing worked until i found this .PERIOD 
Many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters ,COMMA to facilitate literacy -- some are required to .PERIOD 
And now i love languages .PERIOD 
I was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face .PERIOD Never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD 
Everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD I was humiliated .PERIOD 
So i had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD 
These seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete .PERIOD If i wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
That photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships .PERIOD Four months later .PERIOD

It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save .PERIOD And it goes ,COMMA live on the internet .PERIOD Immediately .PERIOD 
So when yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing wikipedia .PERIOD And what i'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside .PERIOD 
And so if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD 
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to ,COMMA can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially .PERIOD 
The biggest languages are german japanese french -- all the western european languages are quite big .PERIOD 
So the big question :COLON when you've got this really chaotic organization is ,COMMA why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK Why is the website as good as it is .PERIOD 
The actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident ,COMMA is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in <NUM> .PERIOD And it wasn't because they were contentious ;SEMICOLON it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes ,COMMA even on stage people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia ,COMMA and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .PERIOD 
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD 
If you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community .PERIOD 
And then users can set up their own personal watch list .PERIOD 
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists .PERIOD Because it is sometimes vandalized .PERIOD 
And that's a really important thing to understand is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe <NUM> to <NUM> people who are in constant communication .PERIOD 
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended .PERIOD 
I give this talk sometimes with angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation ,COMMA with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD So there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD 
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .PERIOD 
Have you found wikipedia ,COMMA being used by teachers .PERIOD And how do you see ?QUESTIONMARK Wikipedia ,COMMA changing education .PERIOD 
It builds on .PERIOD The storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD 
I sent it from my harvard email address because i was recently appointed a fellow there .PERIOD

So what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world .PERIOD 
Too old too young ,COMMA too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid .PERIOD And they won't do it .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate .PERIOD When i think of how intense this brain system is .PERIOD 
And so i've spent the last three years on this .PERIOD 
And so there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature .PERIOD And this reminds me of it .PERIOD

If australia ,COMMA had to send a thousand people tomorrow to west papua ,COMMA for example ,COMMA we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow .PERIOD And we do have a thousand soldiers that could go .PERIOD 
So when we have to send someone ,COMMA we send the military -- because they're there they're available and heck ,COMMA they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves ,COMMA and not having all this extra support .PERIOD 
One particular thing that's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs ,COMMA we ought to be equipping them differently .PERIOD And in particular ,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have .PERIOD 
Military personnel are being trained for war ,COMMA so they're trained that as soon as things go bad .PERIOD Their first response is lethal force .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA being australian i started looking at stuff in australia ,COMMA knowing ,COMMA again ,COMMA from my own experience ,COMMA about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia .PERIOD 
This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone .PERIOD 
This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms ,COMMA but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD 
Now :COLON one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA hey ,COMMA there might be some problems -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on .PERIOD 
You have to be careful about who you're shooting at .PERIOD 
They were holding something like <NUM> people hostage .PERIOD 
And it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale ,COMMA what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious and so on .PERIOD 
The person who's spraying the oc .PERIOD Spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
Just in case ,COMMA you think it's only going to happen in the united states .PERIOD It happened in canada ,COMMA as well .PERIOD 
And a colleague of mine sent me this one from london .PERIOD 
I looked at it .PERIOD I was really surprised .PERIOD 
So if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make ,COMMA you think it's going to be better with military personnel .PERIOD

This particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in <NUM> -- in the detroit area ,COMMA in fact -- and it preceded alfred hitchcock's ,COMMA psycho .PERIOD 
And when i sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company he formed ,COMMA and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD 
Now the other thing that i think is taking off ,COMMA another reason making is taking off today is there's some great new tools out there .PERIOD 
So they're the brains of maker projects .PERIOD And here's an example of one .PERIOD 
These guys came up with a kit version for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing .PERIOD With 3d printers .PERIOD

It's glamorous movie stars ,COMMA like marlene dietrich .PERIOD 
Fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous ,COMMA industrial places .PERIOD 
You had a glamour .PERIOD 
There is a process of idealization ,COMMA glorification and dramatization .PERIOD And it's not just the case for people .PERIOD 
Glamour doesn't have to be people .PERIOD 
It puts you into this special ,COMMA special world .PERIOD 
She's not looking away from you exactly .PERIOD But you have to mentally imagine her world .PERIOD 
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture .PERIOD 
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period .PERIOD But because ,COMMA in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday .PERIOD 
To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort .PERIOD And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .PERIOD 
But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern ,COMMA beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this .PERIOD 
Part of the thing is that in rear window .PERIOD The question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world .PERIOD 
And the answer is no ,COMMA but of course ,COMMA it's really just a movie .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning .PERIOD 
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace .PERIOD The perfect diamond ring .PERIOD 
This is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .PERIOD 
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life .PERIOD 
David hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD 
But i also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD 
But as a scientist ,COMMA i'm interested in a different problem of other minds .PERIOD And that is the one i'm going to introduce to you today .PERIOD 
And then finally ,COMMA to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others ,COMMA can be explained by differences in this brain system .PERIOD 
Child :COLON what ?QUESTIONMARK Rs :COLON pirates :COLON really like :COLON cheese sandwiches .PERIOD 
This pirate is called joshua .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the three-year-old does two things differently .PERIOD 
And second ,COMMA when he sees ivan ,COMMA taking the sandwich where he left his ,COMMA where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his .PERIOD The three-year-old comes up with another explanation .PERIOD He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it because now it's dirty on the ground .PERIOD 
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD 
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now ,COMMA not for an action prediction ,COMMA but for a moral judgment .PERIOD 
Remember :COLON the five-year-old completely understood :COLON why ?QUESTIONMARK Ivan took joshua's sandwich .PERIOD 
Was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua's sandwich .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches .PERIOD 
And so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts .PERIOD Be explained in terms of differences in this brain region .PERIOD 
And her friend drinks the coffee and is fine .PERIOD 
And what you can see is ,COMMA on the left ,COMMA when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief ,COMMA and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD 
First i'm going to show you that .PERIOD This is a magnetic pulse .PERIOD 
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine .PERIOD 
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm where grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar ,COMMA people now say it was more okay .PERIOD She deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee .PERIOD

I mean ,COMMA you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true .PERIOD But that's not all of it .PERIOD

It is something that -- changes of nature .PERIOD 
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way .PERIOD 
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad in a way ,COMMA why not .PERIOD 
But there's also wicked joy ,COMMA you can rejoice in someone's suffering .PERIOD 
We know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA be completely unhappy within .PERIOD 
The experience that translates everything is within the mind .PERIOD 
We have to know from ourselves .PERIOD There are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing ,COMMA to this well-being .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK The greeks called eudaimonia ?QUESTIONMARK Flourishing .PERIOD 
Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature .PERIOD 
For that we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness .PERIOD That's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware .PERIOD 
Usually when we feel annoyed ,COMMA hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something ,COMMA the mind goes again .PERIOD And again to that object .PERIOD 
But we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist .PERIOD 
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD 
So that's what those great meditators have been doing .PERIOD 
If you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA the -05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator who meditated on compassion .PERIOD 
So i've no time to go into all the different scientific results .PERIOD 
Some meditators ,COMMA without trying to stop it .PERIOD But simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event ;SEMICOLON like a shooting star ,COMMA they are able not to move at all .PERIOD 
So the whole point of that is not sort of to make like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD 
We are ready to spend <NUM> years achieving education .PERIOD 
I'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD I'm going to talk to you .PERIOD 
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do .PERIOD But are so often ,COMMA unable ,COMMA in the real world ,COMMA to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine ,COMMA from a design perspective .PERIOD 
It's going to be different than here .PERIOD 
To give you an idea of scale .PERIOD Second life is about <NUM> cpus .PERIOD At this point .PERIOD 
And let me justify that with two statements .PERIOD 
And i think that's something that people have talked about for <NUM> years -- you know that 3d ,COMMA that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD 
Second life originally had <NUM> simulators .PERIOD It now has <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we had -- we zoned it ,COMMA you know .PERIOD We put a nightclub ,COMMA we put a disco where you could dance ,COMMA and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to .PERIOD And we had another place that was like a boardwalk ,COMMA kind of a coney island .PERIOD 
And so the existence of an economy is critical .PERIOD 
The question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life .PERIOD 
And so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside second life is quite -- i think ,COMMA quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve .PERIOD 
Other questions ,COMMA right here .PERIOD 
What's your demographic .PERIOD 
In terms of psychographic -- oh ,COMMA men and women ;SEMICOLON men and women are almost equally matched in second life .PERIOD So about <NUM> percent of the people online right now on second life are women .PERIOD 
In terms of psychographic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to them and meet them .PERIOD And i would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this ,COMMA and find out .PERIOD 
If you count ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA cities .PERIOD So -- but i did -- and i didn't do -- i think i didn't do as well in school as i could have ,COMMA i think you're right .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA so let me restate that .PERIOD 
So you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA much of human life and human experience ,COMMA may move into the digital realm .PERIOD 
That's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD 
I guess and you're asking what do i think about that ?QUESTIONMARK How do i -- jh :COLON what's your response to the people who would say that's horrifying .PERIOD 
(audience ,COMMA if someone would say to you ,COMMA i find that disturbing ,COMMA what would be your response) pr ?QUESTIONMARK Well i'd say a couple of things .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain ?QUESTIONMARK Something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions .PERIOD 
What we're asking about ,COMMA though ,COMMA is human ancestry .PERIOD 
Digging things up out of the ground ,COMMA and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped ,COMMA often skull shape -- saying this looks a little bit more like us than that .PERIOD So this must be my ancestor .PERIOD 
You think ,COMMA you've got a tough job .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA a quick primer on dna .PERIOD 
Mitochondrial dna ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent .PERIOD 
Turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up .PERIOD 
Was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world .PERIOD 
Why was it that we seem to have come out of africa ?QUESTIONMARK So recently .PERIOD 
What was going on to the world's weather around <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience ,COMMA basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you want the ultimate african success story .PERIOD 
Look in the mirror ,COMMA you're it .PERIOD The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around <NUM> <NUM> thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in africa ,COMMA but to expand out of africa .PERIOD 
These would have been savannah hunters .PERIOD 
Entering europe around <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable .PERIOD Siberia inside the arctic circle ,COMMA during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70 ,COMMA -80 ,COMMA even -100 ,COMMA perhaps -- migrating into the americas ,COMMA ultimately reaching that final frontier .PERIOD 
The changes that allowed us to do that :COLON the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us ,COMMA allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i've just been on .PERIOD 
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples .PERIOD 
The human genome project or a mars rover ,COMMA mission .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA you actually can .PERIOD 
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated .PERIOD 
And we all know in our heart of hearts ,COMMA that this is not the way .PERIOD The universe works .PERIOD 
And yet look around us .PERIOD 
Now we move forward <NUM> years .PERIOD 
But that's not completely true .PERIOD 
Recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background .PERIOD 
We have our first stars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean .PERIOD 
And that's why ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA we're so creative and so powerful .PERIOD And that's why we have a history .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA from about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping ,COMMA through trains ,COMMA through telegraph ,COMMA through the internet .PERIOD Until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals .PERIOD 
We've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey of <NUM> billion years .PERIOD 
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role .PERIOD 
Collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force .PERIOD And it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD 
The program ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance .PERIOD 
How many of you have iphones .PERIOD 
And that's what i really want to focus on today .PERIOD 
And what i'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow .PERIOD 
First thing to notice is half of them do not even have access to a <NUM> plan .PERIOD 
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join .PERIOD

The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ,COMMA ended up eating chocolates a week later .PERIOD 
Self-control is not a problem in the future .PERIOD

We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their <NUM> choices .PERIOD 
They're really mad .PERIOD 
We first implemented it ,COMMA richard thaler and i back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
We invited them to save three percentage points .PERIOD More .PERIOD Every time they get a pay ,COMMA raise .PERIOD 
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period ,COMMA four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck ,COMMA three ,COMMA and a half years later ,COMMA saving almost four times as much almost <NUM> percent .PERIOD

And the third said ,COMMA let's find another director .PERIOD 
So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life .PERIOD And she was youthful .PERIOD 
And how many of you did not get that .PERIOD 
It's a symbolic gesture .PERIOD I tear up the script ,COMMA i go ,COMMA and i panic myself ,COMMA i get scared .PERIOD 
Get rid of your mind .PERIOD 
In delhi ,COMMA we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota .PERIOD 
And i don't know why .PERIOD But i remember the story .PERIOD 
There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood .PERIOD And the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax .PERIOD 
And when that ax hits that piece of wood ,COMMA that's when everything will destroy ,COMMA and the big bang will happen again .PERIOD 
But all before that there was a woodcutter .PERIOD 
So every time i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem .PERIOD And so i got over the problem .PERIOD 
If we do not create the stories ,COMMA we probably go mad .PERIOD 
Are you with child .PERIOD 
You ask my permission before you rut ,COMMA before you breed .PERIOD 
Elizabeth :COLON this man has seduced a ward of the queen ,COMMA and she has married without royal consent .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA the word ,COMMA i said ,COMMA suck up .PERIOD 
But i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories ,COMMA and how stories effectively are who we are .PERIOD And how these get translated into the particular discipline that i am in ,COMMA which is film .PERIOD 
We're born for them .PERIOD 
The children's television host ,COMMA mr .PERIOD Rogers ,COMMA always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker .PERIOD That said ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once .PERIOD You've heard their story .PERIOD 
And the way i like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment ,COMMA which is make me care -- please ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA intellectually ,COMMA aesthetically ,COMMA just make me care .PERIOD 
And so if i were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this .PERIOD And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you .PERIOD Here at ted ,COMMA about story .PERIOD 
He insisted ,COMMA no embalming ,COMMA no open coffin ,COMMA no funeral .PERIOD 
It didn't happen to me .PERIOD It happened to somebody else ,COMMA but it's going to be worth your time .PERIOD 
♫ and that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ and we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ that it only ♫ as storytelling without dialogue .PERIOD 
It :COLON confirmed ,COMMA something i really had .PERIOD A hunch on .PERIOD Is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .PERIOD 
And it's something that always drove all his choices .PERIOD 
Wall-e's was to find the beauty .PERIOD 
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them .PERIOD 
But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD 
And that's why change is fundamental in story .PERIOD 
And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good .PERIOD 
And we got a hold of that fax .PERIOD 
And when an artist does that to another artist ,COMMA it's like you're compelled to pass it on .PERIOD 
I was going to help alleviate poverty .PERIOD 
We paid two to three times more than anybody else .PERIOD 
We may have some innovative ,COMMA new ideas .PERIOD 
There's no more of it .PERIOD 
This is where we stand today .PERIOD 
And then we need to use less again .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so let's be generous .PERIOD 
How do you evaluate all the scientific data around a product ,COMMA the data that's changing on a weekly ?QUESTIONMARK If not a daily basis .PERIOD 
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield .PERIOD 
These are the <NUM> commodities .PERIOD That fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation ,COMMA soil loss ,COMMA water use ,COMMA pesticide use ,COMMA over-fishing ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Are we going to work with <NUM> billion producers .PERIOD 
If we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically .PERIOD 
Because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull <NUM> to <NUM> percent of production .PERIOD 
By companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers .PERIOD To do it .PERIOD 
After <NUM> years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved <NUM> of one percent of global food .PERIOD 
We can't wait that long .PERIOD 
We need change that's going to accelerate .PERIOD 
So it's the demand that brings them to the table .PERIOD 
So we're pulling out all the stops .PERIOD 
They're doing it with ibm and the usda ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain ,COMMA because they want everybody to have access to this data .PERIOD Because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable .PERIOD 
If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid ,COMMA the farmer didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities .PERIOD 
This is called bundling .PERIOD It's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity .PERIOD 
We can't just focus on identifying the best ;SEMICOLON we've got to move the rest .PERIOD 
And i'm honored to meet you the future leaders of great britain ,COMMA and this world .PERIOD 
And my mother ,COMMA the most important role model in my life ,COMMA who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters ,COMMA malia and sasha .PERIOD 
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important .PERIOD 
And having done so ,COMMA these women moved many obstacles .PERIOD 
I liked being smart .PERIOD

History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country ,COMMA estate .PERIOD

She is a world-class .PERIOD Soprano singer ,COMMA who studied in rochester ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy .PERIOD 
When you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when i'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open .PERIOD 
The emotions can flow from me to you and back .PERIOD 
It's called aria .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop country and western ,COMMA opera ,COMMA jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color .PERIOD 
They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .PERIOD 
So unusual ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that it was said that it's not clear the internet could work .PERIOD 
Now of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination .PERIOD 
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube .PERIOD 
And here is the message where one of them says looks like .PERIOD We've got a live one .PERIOD We have a hijacking of youtube .PERIOD 
And today ,COMMA wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus .PERIOD 
I am not making this up .PERIOD 
And there are a bunch of people who ,COMMA on a sunny day ,COMMA would rather be inside and monitoring this .PERIOD The administrator's notice ,COMMA board ,COMMA itself a wiki page that anyone can edit .PERIOD 
There are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch .PERIOD 
It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it .PERIOD 
Here is just a snapshot of some of them .PERIOD 
If you do it will be removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is a <NUM> business week cover .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA i know number four ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA can you imagine coming home to that cat ,COMMA everyday .PERIOD 
This one says ,COMMA bucolic meadow with split-rail fence .PERIOD 
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later .PERIOD This person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big .PERIOD If you don't mind .PERIOD 
And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how ,COMMA and whether to respect it .PERIOD 
And we now have means that we can build like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it .PERIOD 
Why there is the craigslist rideshare board .PERIOD 
If it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it .PERIOD 
But it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing .PERIOD 
It's a bee that yes ,COMMA flies .PERIOD 
We all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world .PERIOD 
And by and large ,COMMA this has failed .PERIOD 
Aid actually did the opposite .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i was trying to be an investment banker in new york .PERIOD 
And it reminded me of a day in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And after all ,COMMA poor countries ,COMMA like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal is their days are the same length .PERIOD <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
The question was :COLON how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK 
It turns out ,COMMA <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic .PERIOD 
But in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity .PERIOD That leads to dependability .PERIOD 
There were a lot of reasons .PERIOD People told me why we don't have enough telephones .PERIOD 
The work pays them a salary .PERIOD The salary allows them to pay for the car over time .PERIOD 
The car pays for itself .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA the internet was booming in the us .PERIOD 
And she sells the milk to the villagers ,COMMA and pays off the loan .PERIOD 
And these phones are generating about <NUM> million dollars for the company .PERIOD 
It's just an experiment .PERIOD 
I was a guest student during one month of a public health course .PERIOD 
They read the textbook twice or three times or four times .PERIOD 
And they were the first to twitter ,COMMA transatlantically .PERIOD 
Those are nice words ,COMMA but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty ,COMMA and liberty for whom .PERIOD 
But really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for japan .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA india ,COMMA finally gained its independence .PERIOD 
You can see that the health started to improve .PERIOD 
In '<NUM> ,COMMA india follows with a market reform .PERIOD 
And they go quite closely together .PERIOD And you can see that the similarity with india and china ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA are greater than the differences with them .PERIOD 
Kerala is flying on top there ,COMMA matching united states in health ,COMMA but not in economy .PERIOD 
We have an enormous disparity in the world .PERIOD 
You see ;SEMICOLON china under foreign domination actually lowered their income ,COMMA and came down to the indian level here .PERIOD 
Japan ,COMMA did it like this until full catch up ?QUESTIONMARK And then they follow with the other high-income economies .PERIOD 
Can be worse ,COMMA can be better .PERIOD 
But more recently ,COMMA i've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale .PERIOD 
By invisible .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .PERIOD 
When those measurements are made ,COMMA instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this galaxy ,COMMA and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .PERIOD 
It would be nice .PERIOD If we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly .PERIOD 
Now how do we deduce where the galaxy is .PERIOD 
Where will this observer see the galaxy .PERIOD 
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster ,COMMA and make it into the observer's eye .PERIOD 
So actually ,COMMA at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA i save the bottom ,COMMA take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD 
We shave it off .PERIOD And i have a little gravitational lens .PERIOD Ok .PERIOD 
And we see these gravitational lensing effects ,COMMA these distortions that say that ,COMMA again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD 
They're moving away from each other .PERIOD Because space itself is getting bigger .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
So in the last century ,COMMA ok ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever .PERIOD Whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever .PERIOD Slow down ;SEMICOLON and stop ;SEMICOLON asymptotically stop ;SEMICOLON or slow down ;SEMICOLON stop and then reverse .PERIOD So ,COMMA it starts to contract again .PERIOD 
By how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to say a couple of billion years ago .PERIOD 
So we need something to be able to explain that .PERIOD 
But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
They haven't seen anything ,COMMA ok .PERIOD But it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are .PERIOD 
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year ,COMMA and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy ,COMMA so it will be hard to tell the difference .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA for future endeavors .PERIOD There are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes .PERIOD And there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .PERIOD 
And over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped .PERIOD 
They started with two ,COMMA and they ended with two .PERIOD

And they squirt the water into their mouths .PERIOD 
You load it up in the normal way .PERIOD This is made on existing equipment in <NUM> factories that we license .PERIOD 
Imagine that orchestration .PERIOD 
This happens every year .PERIOD 
And one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me .PERIOD 
And there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard ,COMMA right outside my door .PERIOD 
And like ,COMMA knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up .PERIOD 
And i told him ,COMMA you know ,COMMA cody .PERIOD The wasps actually made that .PERIOD 
They're the people who make the bullet train .PERIOD 
And those bumps act like a magnet for water .PERIOD 
And the fog comes in ,COMMA and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD 
Now it's reversing that equation ,COMMA and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 .PERIOD Thanks to the recipe from the coral .PERIOD 
They actually export water molecules through .PERIOD 
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate .PERIOD 
And we are in a long long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves ,COMMA how can we live here gracefully over the long haul .PERIOD 
Now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ,COMMA i think we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses and to somehow meet them again .PERIOD 
And we're working with eol encyclopedia of life .PERIOD Ed wilson's ,COMMA ted wish .PERIOD 
And this is a pretty well-educated audience :COLON so i imagine you all know something about aids .PERIOD 
If you know something more ,COMMA you probably know that uganda to date is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic .PERIOD 
But i'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem .PERIOD That's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology .PERIOD 
We see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD 
Aids is the same kind of thing .PERIOD It's costly to avoid aids .PERIOD 
And the way that i'm going to do that is ,COMMA i'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria .PERIOD 
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria .PERIOD 
Even if you only cared about aids in africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD 
If people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior .PERIOD 
We know they had this campaign .PERIOD That's how we learn about what works .PERIOD 
So this is another way to see this .PERIOD 
So i am going to talk about exports ,COMMA and prices .PERIOD 
But openness and inter-connectedness ,COMMA it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD I don't think this should be a surprise .PERIOD 
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads ,COMMA with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD 
And what's really ,COMMA really great about being here is i'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that i think up myself .PERIOD 
It's great being here at ted .PERIOD 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth .PERIOD 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it .PERIOD

Captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over <NUM> years ago .PERIOD And it's been used everywhere .PERIOD 
So then i started feeling bad .PERIOD 
So can we get you to do useful work for those <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
So you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA for things that were written more than <NUM> years ago ,COMMA the computer cannot recognize about <NUM> percent of the words .PERIOD 
Johnedwardscom so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD 
There are tens of thousands of these .PERIOD 
Some of them are very cute .PERIOD 
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD 
It hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD It's called duolingo .PERIOD 
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA severin hacker .PERIOD 
Actually it was a forum post .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA it's a question about javascript .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so computer translation ,COMMA not yet good enough .PERIOD 
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web .PERIOD 
We could do that .PERIOD 
If we wanted to translate the other <NUM> percent into spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least <NUM> million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited ,COMMA outsourcing country out there .PERIOD 
So it would be very expensive .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA in the united states alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language .PERIOD 
There's of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the web .PERIOD 
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users ,COMMA we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD 
So here's the site .PERIOD 
But then by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .PERIOD 
We the children had gathered at a friend's house .PERIOD 
I wanted to document on film the <NUM> presidential elections .PERIOD 
And there i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .PERIOD 
The polling stations ,COMMA opened to the voters at <NUM> am ,COMMA but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at <NUM> am in the morning .PERIOD 
They were chanting ,COMMA we want peace .PERIOD 
Now the uphill battle for ghana and for africa is not over ,COMMA but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted .PERIOD 
That -- you know ,COMMA i was born thinking about things that way ,COMMA and i had always been like ,COMMA a little scientist guy .PERIOD 
And people in the 17th century they didn't really understand the same way we do about .PERIOD You know ,COMMA this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose ,COMMA and all that .PERIOD 
And boyle ,COMMA said ,COMMA bullshit .PERIOD 
And so charles said ,COMMA i'm going to put up the money ,COMMA give you guys a building ,COMMA come here ,COMMA and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD 
But experimental ,COMMA science had been tied up with all those things .PERIOD 
Kary mullis they might have done it for the teddy bear .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD 
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .PERIOD 
I was thinking about making my own little rockets .PERIOD 
That's why i thought ,COMMA as long as i don't blow my eyes out .PERIOD 
I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD 
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual .PERIOD 
And it -- they burned .PERIOD 
At any rate ,COMMA i bring it up because it's a good story .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know .PERIOD And that's a personal -- i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal .PERIOD Wouldn't it .PERIOD 
But in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea -- like when i got the idea one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides ,COMMA and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna .PERIOD You know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about <NUM> minutes ,COMMA while i was driving my car .PERIOD And then instead of going -- i went back and i did talk to people about it .PERIOD But if i'd listened to what i heard from ,COMMA all my friends who were molecular biologists -- i would have abandoned it .PERIOD 
But i knew you'd go into the lab and you'd try to make it work yourself ,COMMA and then you're the authority .PERIOD And you can say ,COMMA i know it works .PERIOD Because right there in that tube ,COMMA is where it happened .PERIOD And here ,COMMA on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that i know that's dna .PERIOD And that's the dna i wanted to amplify ,COMMA so there .PERIOD So it does work .PERIOD 
So you have to be honest .PERIOD 
Now let's see .PERIOD 
They made bigger guns to shoot them ,COMMA down with .PERIOD 
And the people i'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called ,COMMA say ,COMMA the inter-governmental panel on climate change .PERIOD 
So the planet should get warmer .PERIOD 
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing .PERIOD You know ,COMMA it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful ,COMMA and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about .PERIOD 
In new york city .PERIOD Rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD 
I was very fond of this space ,COMMA because it's the first massive industrial complex .PERIOD I found on my own that is abandoned .PERIOD 
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .PERIOD 
I was really frightened at first ,COMMA but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project ,COMMA and he didn't seem to mind .PERIOD And so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .PERIOD 
That homeless man ,COMMA to me ,COMMA really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD 
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats ,COMMA so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA the system is very complex and vast .PERIOD 
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do .PERIOD 
I think we agree on that ,COMMA where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ?QUESTIONMARK Right ?QUESTIONMARK Where does all this stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
And would you be able to kind of draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram .PERIOD But would you be able to draw the diagram ?QUESTIONMARK If you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK Or would you just say ,COMMA that's actually not possible .PERIOD 
That's what plants actually do for a living .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models .PERIOD 
And it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense .PERIOD In other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion .PERIOD 
And governments do very well .PERIOD They pat themselves on the back .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA we collude .PERIOD And actually if you -- if someone had designed a test for me when i was doing my biology exams ,COMMA to really understand ,COMMA to see whether i'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air ,COMMA then i might have done better at science .PERIOD 
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .PERIOD 
But within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution .PERIOD 
This is a dead crystal ,COMMA and i'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive .PERIOD 
But there's a problem because up until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible ,COMMA and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD 
If we can make matter alive ,COMMA would we have a matterhazard ?QUESTIONMARK 
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .PERIOD 
You can decode the genome ,COMMA you can look back ,COMMA you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna .PERIOD But we can't get further than the last ancestor the last visible cell that we could sequence ,COMMA or think back in history .PERIOD 
What is life ?QUESTIONMARK What is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
So the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on .PERIOD 
And the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice .PERIOD 
They're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win .PERIOD 
And that is the key .PERIOD 
Let's zoom out to what that could mean .PERIOD 
If we could get evolution into the material world ,COMMA then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution .PERIOD 
And that's really worth thinking about .PERIOD 
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .PERIOD 
So you imagine ,COMMA if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form ,COMMA not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive .PERIOD It can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies ,COMMA because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .PERIOD 
But not only just that ,COMMA we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD 
Evolution cannot be cut apart .PERIOD 
And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD 
We are here today ,COMMA because [the] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .PERIOD 
Look here -- you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender ,COMMA child and maternal health ,COMMA control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations .PERIOD In every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD 
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this with measuring .PERIOD 
I'll prove them wrong on both points .PERIOD 
And i will take kenya as an example .PERIOD 
I was actually on friday sitting in front of my computer ,COMMA and i saw the death rate fall from <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD Just that morning .PERIOD 
That's unfair .PERIOD 
Had i been in the ministry of health .PERIOD In kenya ,COMMA i may have joined these two points .PERIOD 
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .PERIOD 
I give you congo ,COMMA which was high ghana -- lower and kenya -- even lower .PERIOD 
Their countries are so different ,COMMA and they merit to be recognized in the same way ,COMMA as we don't talk about europe as one place .PERIOD 
There ,COMMA we are today .PERIOD 
How the heck could they be [a] ?QUESTIONMARK Developing country ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look -- even if we look in africa -- these are the african countries .PERIOD 
It's very clear that this is what happens .PERIOD 
That is when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact <NUM> to <NUM> years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend ,COMMA which is very strong .PERIOD 
It's a decent life for children .PERIOD We are talking about .PERIOD 
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid .PERIOD 
But if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens .PERIOD 
And if they do so then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD 
An innovator is one who does not know .PERIOD It cannot be done .PERIOD 
They combine all that .PERIOD 
And it was that compassion which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw -- in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family ,COMMA like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA how we started ,COMMA ratan ,COMMA just began with a five-engineer team ,COMMA young people in their mid-twenties .PERIOD 
It was an open innovation .PERIOD Ideas from all over .PERIOD Were welcome .PERIOD 
And the seat riser ,COMMA for example ,COMMA serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity .PERIOD 
And british motor was around <NUM> .PERIOD 
And unbelievably in <NUM> years ,COMMA i was the first indian to be honored .PERIOD 
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks ,COMMA [unclear] and functions .PERIOD 
Are you getting more drugs ,COMMA because you are spending more time and more money .PERIOD 
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms .PERIOD 
And incubator costs <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
But then he held it for a little while lakshmi .PERIOD 
That gave me a great message focus ,COMMA and you can achieve .PERIOD 
And currently i'm president of global research ,COMMA alliance ,COMMA <NUM> scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK From india to the us .PERIOD 
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground ,COMMA basically ,COMMA animal ,COMMA mineral vegetable .PERIOD 
Long-distance ,COMMA telephone service sold on price ,COMMA price ,COMMA price ,COMMA fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing .PERIOD And even the internet is commoditizing not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD 
Now most places that i talk to ,COMMA when i talk about experience ,COMMA i talk about disney -- the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD 
And then i always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question ,COMMA particularly coming from the dutch ,COMMA is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed ,COMMA that each one has their own business imperative ,COMMA matched with a consumer sensibility .PERIOD 
Because all businesses are man-made objects ;SEMICOLON all business is involved with money .PERIOD All business is a matter of using machinery ,COMMA and all those things make something inauthentic .PERIOD 
At the end of a laundry list of advice he's giving to his son laertes .PERIOD He says this .PERIOD And this above all ,COMMA to thine own self be true .PERIOD 
As businesses :COLON are the economic offerings :COLON you are providing -- are they true to themselves .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are ,COMMA then you're real real .PERIOD 
Universal city walk is a real fake -- in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from ada louise huxtable's book the unreal america .PERIOD 
But is it really true to itself .PERIOD 
So she calls it a real fake .PERIOD 
So understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience .PERIOD 
Then you have that perception ,COMMA that you are phony .PERIOD 
A few words about how i got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
I would make things for people ,COMMA as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving showing them my love .PERIOD 
So it has to end with this -- -- gratuitous violence .PERIOD 
So that was how i first started to explore the way things moved ,COMMA and expressed it .PERIOD 
I was also very interested in ,COMMA perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused ,COMMA intense way .PERIOD 
When i see objects ,COMMA i imagine them in motion .PERIOD 
That's about that big .PERIOD 
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the puppet .PERIOD And i'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because i'm playing with an object .PERIOD 
And they would coalesce for just a moment .PERIOD So you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD 
What would i love .PERIOD 
So this is a little wire-bending tool .PERIOD 
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers ,COMMA i made that tool .PERIOD And then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD 
And the idea ,COMMA their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street ,COMMA and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i'll just let this chair come down .PERIOD 
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus ,COMMA from conception to birth ,COMMA using these kinds of new technologies .PERIOD 
<NUM> days heart chamber developing <NUM> days arms &amp ;SEMICOLON hands are developing <NUM> days .PERIOD Beginning of the primitive vertabrae these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus .PERIOD 
<NUM> days ,COMMA <NUM> days ,COMMA developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers the fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular and skeletal growth .PERIOD 
Every six months until they're six years old -- we're going to be doing ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to about <NUM> children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development ,COMMA actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .PERIOD 
I'm a spectroscopist .PERIOD 
Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .PERIOD 
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .PERIOD 
It's the only place where you can produce ,COMMA actually ,COMMA osmium .PERIOD 
It was incredible ;SEMICOLON the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star .PERIOD 
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD It comes from a different galaxy .PERIOD 
And sometimes they just capture stars .PERIOD 
We were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun .PERIOD 
This can be done with the future spectrographs .PERIOD 
Coming back to the most important question .PERIOD Is there anybody out there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward .PERIOD 
It's exactly the same game ,COMMA a very tiny feature .PERIOD 
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum .PERIOD 
Now very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA i'm talking about last ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months ,COMMA water ,COMMA methane ,COMMA carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .PERIOD 
And with the known physics ,COMMA etc .PERIOD It's something actually ,COMMA which has been pointed out by frank drake ,COMMA many years ago ,COMMA and shklovsky .PERIOD 
They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines ,COMMA in the spectrum of a star in different ways .PERIOD 
And we are doing this job since <NUM> ,COMMA and it's a very heavy project .PERIOD 
We have been working very hard .PERIOD 
I think it will come from a spectrum like this .PERIOD 
It will take about five years .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA but the thing i liked about your talk is you're a storyteller .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA i'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD 
I'm a qualitative researcher .PERIOD 
And maybe i'm just a storyteller .PERIOD 
The other thing that they had in common was this :COLON they fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD 
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .PERIOD 
Do you have any recommendations .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA i'm great .PERIOD I'm okay .PERIOD 
I just need some strategies .PERIOD 
And then i said it's bad ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
The problem is -- and i learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .PERIOD 
You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing .PERIOD The other affects ,COMMA our emotions .PERIOD 
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD 
There's no conversation .PERIOD 
Which ,COMMA just ,COMMA i hope in <NUM> years ,COMMA people will look back and go .PERIOD Wow .PERIOD 
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA look at her .PERIOD She's perfect .PERIOD 
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade .PERIOD 
We do that in our personal lives .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA as you can see very small ,COMMA and also very cheap .PERIOD 
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement .PERIOD For self-discovery ,COMMA self-awareness ,COMMA self-knowledge .PERIOD 
Some people will say it's for public health research .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD 
All of our statuses are different .PERIOD 
All of our hopes and dreams what we want to accomplish is different .PERIOD And our paths will be different ,COMMA they are all stories .PERIOD 
And go from this concept of walking breathing ,COMMA and then his hands speak ,COMMA and ultimately happiness and function .PERIOD 
And we took this and we converted it into data .PERIOD 
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time .PERIOD 
So here's steven alone ,COMMA sharing this story in the world .PERIOD 
We need to give to others ,COMMA to be successful .PERIOD 
And i'm going to show you what patients like me the company that myself .PERIOD My youngest brother and a good friend from mit started .PERIOD 
But you can aggregate this ,COMMA and you can discover things about treatments .PERIOD 
So you can see the duration .PERIOD 
I'm going to log in .PERIOD 
And this is a new version of our platform .PERIOD We're launching right now .PERIOD 
I'm taking three drugs to manage it .PERIOD Some of them are experimental .PERIOD 
So can i take this data -- rearrange yourself ,COMMA put the symptoms in the left ,COMMA the drugs across the top tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else ,COMMA and what interacts .PERIOD 
Doctors actually love this sheet ,COMMA and they're actually really engaged .PERIOD 
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium .PERIOD 
It's never going to work .PERIOD You can't do it .PERIOD 
And then we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how do we line them all up .PERIOD 
And it works almost every time .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation .PERIOD We'll do that later .PERIOD 
We hired them ,COMMA set them up ,COMMA assisting at lab .PERIOD 
Because something went different .PERIOD 
And i am thankful .PERIOD 
We know what they are .PERIOD 
The b15 iceberg broke off .PERIOD The ross ice shelf .PERIOD 
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy ,COMMA the electron .PERIOD 
A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun .PERIOD 
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in .PERIOD 
We'd have to see at night ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
But because it's flexible ,COMMA it can be on any surface whatsoever .PERIOD 
It was ,COMMA in actually a diner outside of dallas/fort worth airport .PERIOD 
Ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside ,COMMA hold it until you need it ,COMMA and then be able to release it and pass it off .PERIOD 
<NUM> trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend .PERIOD 
I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists ,COMMA no kinder than many of the people in the world .PERIOD But they have a magic look at the world .PERIOD 
By any standard ,COMMA this is wrong .PERIOD 
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean ,COMMA i'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do .PERIOD And i wanted to play war .PERIOD 
And on the other side were all my sister's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD 
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible .PERIOD 
With one broken leg .PERIOD 
I can delete that dot ,COMMA because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD 
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how in a statistically valid way .PERIOD Do we eliminate the weirdos .PERIOD 
When i applied to harvard ,COMMA i applied on a dare .PERIOD 
I didn't expect to get in ,COMMA and my family had no money for college .PERIOD 
Which i'm glad you liked ,COMMA but they did not like that at all .PERIOD 
Here's how we get to health .PERIOD We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .PERIOD 
Doctors are <NUM> percent ,COMMA faster ,COMMA more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative ,COMMA neutral or stressed .PERIOD 
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula .PERIOD So we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .PERIOD 
Exercise ,COMMA teaches your brain that your behavior matters .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor .PERIOD If you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .PERIOD 
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university .PERIOD 
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures ,COMMA there are fewer male teachers .PERIOD 
But male role models for boys ,COMMA that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads .PERIOD They've got pastors ;SEMICOLON they've got cub scout leaders .PERIOD But ultimately ,COMMA six hours a day ,COMMA five days a week they're spending in a classroom .PERIOD And most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .PERIOD 
This is a place for girls .PERIOD 
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there .PERIOD 
And if you ask title <NUM> teachers ,COMMA they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades .PERIOD 
All of those conversations need to be happening .PERIOD 
Who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so everyone has a computer .PERIOD 
I went to mit ,COMMA did my math .PERIOD But i had this wonderful opportunity .PERIOD Because computers had just become visual .PERIOD 
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs .PERIOD 
I didn't quite get it .PERIOD And paul rand was a kind of crusty designer .PERIOD You know ,COMMA a crusty designer ,COMMA like a good -- kind of like a good french bread .PERIOD 
This is the first sort of play thing .PERIOD I did my own serious play .PERIOD 
This is actually bad human experiments .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA humans don't know how to take orders .PERIOD The computer's so good at it .PERIOD 
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once .PERIOD You know ,COMMA you pen ,COMMA do this .PERIOD And you pen ,COMMA do this .PERIOD 
And after this ,COMMA i wanted to build a computer out of people called a human-powered computer .PERIOD 
I have behind this wall ,COMMA a disk drive ,COMMA a cpu ,COMMA a graphics card .PERIOD A memory system .PERIOD 
On the computer ,COMMA when you move your mouse ,COMMA that arrow moves around .PERIOD 
I have no staff .PERIOD It's all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA naomi was pivotal in that .PERIOD 
So if you can see here ,COMMA you know that program you're seeing in the corner ,COMMA if you spread it out ,COMMA it's all these things .PERIOD All at once .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA get it ?QUESTIONMARK No ?QUESTIONMARK Ok .PERIOD 
They're littler computers .PERIOD So the one-chip computers ,COMMA i began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of pc boards .PERIOD Leds .PERIOD 
I did a show in london last year ,COMMA made out of ipods -- i used ipods as a material .PERIOD 
We have this gene defect in our mind .PERIOD 
This is from the cape last year .PERIOD 
This is also out there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
And i went after it with passion .PERIOD 
I was like ,COMMA aha !EXCLAMATIONMARK Wait a second .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA everyone .PERIOD 
What is it about flying cars .PERIOD 
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where ,COMMA on your way here this morning ,COMMA you see something that really ,COMMA truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that i don't know about you .PERIOD But i really enjoy spending time in .PERIOD 
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground .PERIOD This may be counter-intuitive ,COMMA but driving has potholes ,COMMA cobblestones ,COMMA pedestrians ,COMMA other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with .PERIOD 
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit .PERIOD And the wings come out .PERIOD 
Radio ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA that was gorgeous .PERIOD 
The transition will cost in line with other small airplanes .PERIOD 
And i'm certainly not out to replace your chevy .PERIOD But i do think that the transition should be your next airplane .PERIOD 
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .PERIOD 
The question was given to a bunch of engineers about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA how do we make the journey to paris better ?QUESTIONMARK 
What you should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA do ,COMMA is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels ,COMMA pay them to walk the length of the train ,COMMA handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey .PERIOD 
They seem fantastic to me .PERIOD They cost very little to develop .PERIOD 
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further ,COMMA and actually produce placebo education .PERIOD 
Before long there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA boring people would have just simply banned the veil .PERIOD 
All value is perceived value .PERIOD 
These funny signs that flash your speed at you ,COMMA some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face ,COMMA to act as an emotional trigger .PERIOD 
The wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french ,COMMA were encouraged to give in all their jewelry .PERIOD 
The interesting thing is that for <NUM> years .PERIOD Hence ,COMMA the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA was made of cast iron .PERIOD 
Because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry .PERIOD This actually had symbolic value ,COMMA badge value .PERIOD 
If you think about it ,COMMA shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA what we add on top is kind of false .PERIOD It's a fake version .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value .PERIOD And it's much fairer .PERIOD 
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving .PERIOD 
I would say it's a work of genius .PERIOD 
So i just want to get your first impressions .PERIOD When you see that ,COMMA when you see the diamond shreddies box there .PERIOD 
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six .PERIOD If you flip it over ,COMMA it looks like a nine .PERIOD 
Thank you very much indeed .PERIOD 
We're seeing the consequences all around us .PERIOD 
I would say not just biological design .PERIOD But all of the design that we think of as human design .PERIOD 
And <NUM> pages later .PERIOD 
And another <NUM> pages later .PERIOD 
Or design out of chaos without the aid of mind .PERIOD 
Chaos :COLON no ,COMMA what mind ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD 
But that it will get copied if it can ,COMMA regardless of the consequences .PERIOD 
This is design process going on .PERIOD 
A meme is not equivalent to an idea .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON sink toilet .PERIOD 
This has spread all over the world .PERIOD 
So this is a view of what humans are .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA in the short time i've already been at ted ,COMMA i see we're even closer than i thought we were before .PERIOD 
We'll think we're choosing these things ,COMMA but the temes are making us .PERIOD Do it .PERIOD 
It's been very productive that equation .PERIOD 
Getting a new replicator is .PERIOD Dangerous .PERIOD 
We may take the gaian view .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA all about big brains .PERIOD 
And why would they do that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA those are the two possibilities .PERIOD 
I have no idea .PERIOD 
I was afraid of a tsunami .PERIOD What i didn't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti ,COMMA and that was building collapse .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA it was the buildings ,COMMA not the earthquake ,COMMA that killed <NUM> people ,COMMA that injured <NUM> ,COMMA that displaced <NUM> million people that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation .PERIOD 
Behind that door is the national judicial archives .PERIOD 
Now there's a solution to all these problems .PERIOD 
And because i had <NUM> percent of my body burned it would take about an hour .PERIOD 
So originally ,COMMA i didn't have much money ,COMMA so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter's vice .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system .PERIOD So we said ,COMMA why don't we get people to sign the honor code .PERIOD 
And this is particularly interesting because mit doesn't have an honor code .PERIOD 
No bill ever disappeared .PERIOD 
We did not pay them with dollars .PERIOD We paid them with something else .PERIOD 
But this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet because in enron .PERIOD There's also a social element .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment ,COMMA and we told them that at the end we asked them to pay us back the money .PERIOD They didn't make ok .PERIOD 
What would happen to the other people in the group .PERIOD 
Will they cheat more ,COMMA or will they cheat less .PERIOD 
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students .PERIOD 
When we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less .PERIOD 
But unless we start testing those intuitions ,COMMA we're not going to do better .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD 
Well :COLON cèilidh first of all is gaelic for party ,COMMA but kitchen party in cape breton is very common .PERIOD And basically somebody drops into the house ,COMMA and no matter what house you go to in cape breton .PERIOD There's a fiddle there ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA and i'd say ,COMMA well there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world ,COMMA so ten chances to one ,COMMA the fellow who walked in the door could play it .PERIOD So you'd have someone come into the house ,COMMA you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold ,COMMA a little party would start up ,COMMA and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing .PERIOD So it was a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful way to grow up .PERIOD And that is where my beginnings in music come from :COLON my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself .PERIOD And oh ,COMMA i've done lots of things with my music .PERIOD 
Donnell leahy .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD I'm kind of new to the ted experience ,COMMA and i'm glad to be here ,COMMA but i'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out ,COMMA and i've been here for a short while ,COMMA and i'm starting to understand a little bit better .PERIOD 
We learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television ,COMMA we didn't listen to a lot of radio ,COMMA we went to church and to school sometimes ,COMMA and farmed and played music .PERIOD So we were able ,COMMA i think ,COMMA at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self ,COMMA and my mother plays .PERIOD My father plays .PERIOD And the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario ,COMMA we call it ,COMMA french-canadian style ,COMMA but it originated in logging camps .PERIOD 
Airs were played in europe at burials ,COMMA as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site ,COMMA the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .PERIOD 
We're laughing ,COMMA like because our styles are totally different .PERIOD As you can hear .PERIOD 
Announcer :COLON great news :COLON they're running ,COMMA late ,COMMA downstairs .PERIOD 
When she got up to make tea ,COMMA she placed him in my own lap ,COMMA and i had never felt a child .PERIOD That was that emaciated .PERIOD 
Single mother ,COMMA hiv ,COMMA positive .PERIOD 
I photographed her before and after the birth of her ,COMMA beautiful ,COMMA baby girl issa .PERIOD 
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter ,COMMA like so many other zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic .PERIOD 
And i was constantly reading the new york times and stunned by the statistics .PERIOD The numbers .PERIOD 
So i quit my job and decided that that's the subject that i wanted to tackle .PERIOD 
We've known about fusion since <NUM> .PERIOD When sir arthur stanley eddington and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that's why the sun shines .PERIOD 
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources ,COMMA i got very upset about as upset .PERIOD As i did ,COMMA when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun .PERIOD 
Energy at the moment ,COMMA is dominated by resource .PERIOD 
It's a medium-sized nucleus .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD 
So that's that process there .PERIOD Deuterium and tritium goes together ,COMMA makes helium <NUM> .PERIOD 
And that energy is what powers fusion .PERIOD 
And as you go across there ,COMMA you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line by the way ,COMMA is the lowest estimate of existing resources .PERIOD 
And as you go across there ,COMMA you will see that we've got a few tens of years ,COMMA and perhaps <NUM> years of fossil fuels left .PERIOD 
So how would we make it .PERIOD 
We can do fusion in the center of this device .PERIOD We made <NUM> megawatts of fusion power in <NUM> .PERIOD 
If you want to know how ask yourself this question ,COMMA what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail .PERIOD 
Because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you .PERIOD How it keeps us from attempting great things ,COMMA and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things .PERIOD Stop happening .PERIOD 
The path to truly new ,COMMA never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way .PERIOD 
In october of <NUM> ,COMMA the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in <NUM> million years we could build an aircraft that would fly .PERIOD 
<NUM> years later ,COMMA aero experts coined the term transonic .PERIOD 
Since we took to the sky ,COMMA we have wanted to fly faster .PERIOD And farther .PERIOD 
It's boosted to near-space atop a minotaur iv .PERIOD Rocket .PERIOD 
That's an unnatural act for a rocket .PERIOD 
The third stage has a camera .PERIOD 
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight .PERIOD One .PERIOD 
Now to conceal the shape ,COMMA we changed the aspect ratio ,COMMA a little bit .PERIOD 
This is a hummingbird drone .PERIOD 
It does not eat nectar .PERIOD 
Or perhaps spider man will one day .PERIOD Be gecko .PERIOD Man .PERIOD 
Each lightning bolt heats the air to <NUM> degrees fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the sun .PERIOD 
Using a grid the size of your thumb with <NUM> electrodes ,COMMA on the surface of his brain .PERIOD Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm .PERIOD 
This .PERIOD Green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life .PERIOD 
They are nerds ,COMMA and they are heroes among us .PERIOD 
There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for .PERIOD You .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i don't think we ultimately know what it will be right .PERIOD 
It's actually look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA look ,COMMA our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise .PERIOD 
That's what we do .PERIOD 
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention ,COMMA but at a personal level .PERIOD In a way ,COMMA i can't imagine doing your job .PERIOD 
But quite frankly ,COMMA on this issue ,COMMA there is no other road .PERIOD 
Sorry ,COMMA this was my mother ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in her bead shop in london .PERIOD 
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .PERIOD 
And the british government saying you need to be in the top five .PERIOD 
But you just have to go to a garden center .PERIOD And they're in little paper packets .PERIOD 
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .PERIOD 
And the government agreed to do that ,COMMA and not do anything else ,COMMA and focus our energy on that .PERIOD 
This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .PERIOD 
I'm sorry about my stupid voice :COLON there .PERIOD 
So if we could chop that away ,COMMA and give the building a small bottom ,COMMA we could take that bit .PERIOD And put it at the top ,COMMA where the greater commercial value is for a property .PERIOD Developer .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
June cohen :COLON so thank you .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD Thomas ,COMMA you're a delight .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us ,COMMA very quickly .PERIOD 
The self changed got affected ,COMMA broken destroyed ,COMMA but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger ,COMMA sometimes hateful ,COMMA sometimes not wanting to be there at all .PERIOD 
The self was not constant .PERIOD 
But nature had its wicked way ,COMMA and brown babies were born .PERIOD 
It was the first time that i existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that i controlled ,COMMA that i steered ,COMMA that i gave life to .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i thought i had the answer to that one ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA skin color .PERIOD 
For a start ,COMMA we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .PERIOD 
I take it to therapy .PERIOD 
And in that disconnected state ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we can build factory farms with no windows ,COMMA destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .PERIOD 
Thank you for listening .PERIOD 
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture ,COMMA looking at me with some concern .PERIOD 
And here is another picture of them .PERIOD 
They are supposed to be locked up .PERIOD 
And i became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because i was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team .PERIOD And i didn't know what to do .PERIOD 
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain .PERIOD And the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD 
I've had it .PERIOD 
It took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do .PERIOD 
At the beginning ,COMMA it was a disaster .PERIOD 
I tried harsh words and threats ,COMMA and they took me nowhere .PERIOD 
Go away you maniac-psychopath .PERIOD 
And i would say ,COMMA relax ,COMMA alex .PERIOD 
So for such a kid ,COMMA when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation ,COMMA irrespective of how he behaves .PERIOD It's a tremendous healing experience .PERIOD 
Now i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology .PERIOD 
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD 
All you have to do is play with it ,COMMA change it a little bit and come up with something that does help .PERIOD That does work .PERIOD 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains .PERIOD Before .PERIOD 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them .PERIOD 
In every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations ,COMMA taking in this incredible landscape around me .PERIOD And i feel blessed and fortunate that i'm alive ,COMMA and that i sense every fiber in my aching body .PERIOD 
The blank slate was an influential idea in the 20th century .PERIOD 
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they -- using mri -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is ,COMMA the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people .PERIOD 
And as you can see ,COMMA large amounts of the brain ,COMMA are not purple ,COMMA showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal ,COMMA twin .PERIOD 
And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna -- namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD 
Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering .PERIOD 
And so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence ,COMMA we hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are created equal ,COMMA he did not mean ,COMMA we hold these truths to be self-evident ,COMMA that all men are clones .PERIOD 
That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts ,COMMA and some of them can inhibit others .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened .PERIOD 
Visual ;SEMICOLON arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal .PERIOD 
A paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf .PERIOD And there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century .PERIOD Here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .PERIOD 
And the job in question was sheep ;SEMICOLON rancher .PERIOD 
This one was actually around the playing cards i got yesterday ,COMMA but it had a certain familiarity to it .PERIOD 
Albert is the shepherd .PERIOD In question .PERIOD 
Albert goes in .PERIOD I follow albert the crew is around .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA time out ,COMMA stop .PERIOD 
We don't fool around ;SEMICOLON we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get .PERIOD 
And i'm like ,COMMA i don't know what just happened ,COMMA but there are testicles in this bucket ,COMMA and that's not how we do it .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
Gets up walks to the corner .PERIOD It's quivering ,COMMA and it lies down .PERIOD And it's in obvious distress .PERIOD 
He's like a day .PERIOD 
And i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time .PERIOD 
Melanie picks up the lamb ,COMMA puts it on the post ,COMMA opens it up .PERIOD 
I do .PERIOD 
And i'm like ,COMMA what is this jacked-up metaphor .PERIOD 
Anagnorisis !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is the greek word for discovery .PERIOD 
That's peripety or peripeteia .PERIOD 
It's crushing when the audience sees it .PERIOD The right way .PERIOD 
Looking at that poor other little thing that i'd done it the right way on .PERIOD And i just was struck by if i'm wrong about that ,COMMA and if i'm wrong so often in a literal way ,COMMA what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA these are the people that i work with ,COMMA every single day .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA dude ,COMMA you know four years .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA know ,COMMA follow your dreams and go broke right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first ,COMMA the business of getting it done .PERIOD 
Most hazardous environment i'd ever seen .PERIOD And i was back with a guy ,COMMA lashing the pots down .PERIOD 
I scamper down ,COMMA i go into the wheelhouse ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA with some level of incredulity ,COMMA captain osha .PERIOD 
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work as a society .PERIOD All of us .PERIOD 
We turn them into heroes ,COMMA or we turn them into punch lines .PERIOD 
I just know that that's a front in this war .PERIOD 
And i realized probably ,COMMA too late in this game -- i hope not ,COMMA because i don't know if i can do <NUM> more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can .PERIOD 
It's been great talking to you and get back to work .PERIOD Will you .PERIOD 
Democracy ,COMMA as a type of politics is a technology for the control and deployment of power .PERIOD 
I would put it in the following equation :COLON no <NUM>/<NUM> :COLON no war .PERIOD 
Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals .PERIOD 
You can show the capitol -- i had the same problem when i was designing the cover of my forthcoming book .PERIOD In fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy ?QUESTIONMARK 
You can show a mosque ,COMMA or you can show worshippers ,COMMA but there's not a straightforward way of depicting islam .PERIOD 
These are contested points ,COMMA and it's impossible to answer them by saying ,COMMA ah ,COMMA ha !EXCLAMATIONMARK I looked in the right place !EXCLAMATIONMARK And i found out what these concepts mean .PERIOD 
And i think that that's ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA probably the first appropriate response .PERIOD 
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies .PERIOD 
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it .PERIOD 
They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there .PERIOD Why .PERIOD 
Now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason ,COMMA for hope ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world .PERIOD 
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the horrific bp oil spill a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown ,COMMA that fewer than one percent of them survive .PERIOD After being released .PERIOD 
And the local seabird rescue center named sanccob ,COMMA immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .PERIOD 
I was a penguin aquarist at the new england aquarium .PERIOD 
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .PERIOD 
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity ,COMMA this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving .PERIOD And awe-inspiring .PERIOD 
Now mind you three days earlier ,COMMA we had <NUM> penguins under our care .PERIOD So we were definitely overwhelmed .PERIOD And ,COMMA just a bit terrified -- at least i was .PERIOD 
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled -- they collected <NUM> -- and we'll ship them <NUM> miles up the coast to port elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there .PERIOD And let them swim back home .PERIOD 
About a year prior to this oil spill ,COMMA a <NUM> year-old student had invented a degreaser .PERIOD 
Just look at that <NUM> year-old .PERIOD 
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .PERIOD 
And i was doing some rather controversial religious programs .PERIOD 
This went down very well in the uk .PERIOD Where religion is extremely unpopular .PERIOD 
Indeed some of the world traditions ,COMMA think very little of religious orthodoxy .PERIOD 
You behave in a committed way .PERIOD And then you begin to understand the truths of religion .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because in compassion ,COMMA when we feel with the other ,COMMA we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world .PERIOD And we put another person there and once we get rid of ego .PERIOD Then we're ready to see the divine .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the golden rule .PERIOD 
Hillel stood on one leg and said that which is hateful to you ,COMMA do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD That is the torah :COLON the rest is commentary .PERIOD 
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point .PERIOD I think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group .PERIOD Your own nation ,COMMA your own co-religionists ,COMMA your own fellow countrymen .PERIOD You must have what one of the chinese sages called jian ai :COLON concern for everybody love your enemies ,COMMA honor ,COMMA the stranger .PERIOD 
And this again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains .PERIOD 
Now i've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who ,COMMA when i say to them what i do for a living ,COMMA inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong .PERIOD 
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time .PERIOD 
I was part of that united nations initiative ,COMMA called the alliance of civilizations ,COMMA which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes of extremism .PERIOD And to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism .PERIOD 
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time .PERIOD 
Moving on to something a bit larger .PERIOD This is an x-ray of a bus .PERIOD 
It's not just topshop .PERIOD I get some strange looks .PERIOD When i go out getting my props .PERIOD 
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with ,COMMA is how nature is related to architecture .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA that is three months solid x-raying .PERIOD 
And when they do ,COMMA i'm in the queue .PERIOD 
So i like to use them .PERIOD 
That flower doesn't come in bright orange .PERIOD I don't think .PERIOD 
I'm now going to show you a short film ,COMMA i'll step to the side .PERIOD 
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning x-ray machine ,COMMA which is used on the borders between countries ,COMMA looking for contraband and illegal immigrants .PERIOD 
I will show how the capillary action works ,COMMA how it feeds ,COMMA i'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem .PERIOD 
Sometimes you keep the time up ,COMMA because the time gives you detail .PERIOD 
The longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get .PERIOD 
I've got the opportunity now to show you what i'm going to be doing in the future .PERIOD 
Like my first computer was a big movement in my life .PERIOD 
Meet tony :COLON he's my student .PERIOD 
If i ever get out of here ,COMMA there will always be a mark by my name .PERIOD 
I'm a convict ;SEMICOLON i am branded 'wrong' what are you going to tell me about right and wrong .PERIOD 
Then can you tell me what wrong is .PERIOD 
Socrates ;SEMICOLON died in prison his philosophy ,COMMA intact .PERIOD 
His body is in prison .PERIOD But his mind is free .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA they gave <NUM> monkeys a typewriter for a week ,COMMA and after a week ,COMMA they only used it as a bathroom .PERIOD 
You'll been engulfed by a red giant .PERIOD 
Love does not die .PERIOD Because of that thing .PERIOD 
I'm very lucky ,COMMA because he's better than all the other children .PERIOD 
That's the wonderful thing about evolution -- the predilection to believe that our child is best .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA that's just a survival thing .PERIOD 
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes ,COMMA and therefore we love it .PERIOD 
But we don't notice that bit .PERIOD We just unconditionally love .PERIOD 
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own .PERIOD 
You house is in a terrible state .PERIOD 
You think ,COMMA what should i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
For me ,COMMA it's a very ,COMMA very important thing .PERIOD 
I look out the window ,COMMA and i realize that every single time we stop and i look out that window ,COMMA framed in that window .PERIOD Wherever we are ,COMMA i am observing more life than there is in the rest of the known universe beyond the planet earth .PERIOD 
That to me ,COMMA is an incredible thing .PERIOD 
I began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas .PERIOD 
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security .PERIOD 
This is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA unless your whole life is about being secure .PERIOD 
You become whatever it .PERIOD Is that will freeze you ,COMMA numb you and protect you from doubt or change .PERIOD 
But all this does actually is shut down your mind .PERIOD 
One of the amazing things that i've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .PERIOD 
I've discovered these people who in v-day world ,COMMA we call vagina warriors .PERIOD 
They raised <NUM> dollars on a production that never occurred .PERIOD 
Now this seems like a fairly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA frivolous .PERIOD But what happened as a result of that is that that school now is forming a sex education class .PERIOD It's beginning to talk about sex .PERIOD It's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina ,COMMA publicly or to say that she loved her vagina ,COMMA publicly .PERIOD 
In the years that she walked ,COMMA she educated parents ,COMMA mothers ,COMMA fathers .PERIOD 
Real security is contemplating death ,COMMA not pretending it doesn't exist .PERIOD 
And i think part of what i'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief .PERIOD 
Now i was stupid ,COMMA but not so stupid that i turned it down .PERIOD 
It is the story factory .PERIOD One of the very best in the world .PERIOD 
But they all have one thing in common .PERIOD They all need to look like something .PERIOD 
They all need a face .PERIOD 
The first was katharine hepburn's memoirs ,COMMA and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich .PERIOD 
So the hepburn story is words ,COMMA and the dietrich story is pictures ,COMMA and so we did this .PERIOD 
And what i ended up with was a graphic representation of us ,COMMA seeing this animal coming into being .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA that is not me .PERIOD 
That's a responsibility .PERIOD 
A book cover is a distillation .PERIOD 
This story was a real puzzle .PERIOD 
Huhh ,COMMA and now the sultan is in danger .PERIOD 
Don't get me started .PERIOD 
But something is definitely lost :COLON tradition :COLON a sensual experience ,COMMA the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity .PERIOD 
What does it look like .PERIOD 
Yes it can it does .PERIOD And it will .PERIOD But for this book designer ,COMMA page-turner ,COMMA dog-eared place-holder ,COMMA notes in the margins-taker ,COMMA ink-sniffer ,COMMA the story looks like this .PERIOD 
The students should teach their teachers .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we heard that one too but pioneer germ ,COMMA fighters totally rules .PERIOD 
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older .PERIOD My parents were really supportive .PERIOD 
The school i went to was pretty boring .PERIOD 
And that was the finishing post right there .PERIOD 
But our school at that time got a grant from the government ,COMMA and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine ,COMMA 3dz -- and they left the programming manuals lying around .PERIOD 
That's what they thought they had built it for .PERIOD 
This is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding .PERIOD So males choose the lucky rabbit .PERIOD 
So i went on for the next <NUM> years or so making a lot of different games .PERIOD 
Now chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me ?QUESTIONMARK So i've done that .PERIOD 
But <NUM> percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever .PERIOD So it's just not true .PERIOD 
It makes about <NUM> million bucks a month in subscriptions .PERIOD 
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it .PERIOD 
I played in the backyard ,COMMA learned to read ,COMMA and even ate some of my vegetables .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA as was the case for most of my generation ,COMMA i spent a lot of time in front of the tv .PERIOD 
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama of prime time ,COMMA tv .PERIOD 
I have fought in wars ,COMMA feared for my own survival ,COMMA watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel more real than any textbook .PERIOD Or any news story .PERIOD 
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities ,COMMA and doing many of the same things we once did in real life .PERIOD Only virtually .PERIOD 
The sensory cues are very similar .PERIOD 
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us .PERIOD 
Video games are fun engaging ,COMMA and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming ?QUESTIONMARK 
There is a potential to do good as well .PERIOD 
Wow .PERIOD 
This is just a cool shot ,COMMA because this is students coming to school after class .PERIOD 
She's never going to know a world where video games aren't incredibly emotional ,COMMA and will probably make her cry .PERIOD 
Chris :COLON anderson :COLON david .PERIOD Perry ,COMMA that was awesome .PERIOD 
It's this change in perspective on what it is we think we're perceiving .PERIOD That has helped us make more progress in the last <NUM> years than we have in the rest of human history .PERIOD 
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more ,COMMA we like more .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish .PERIOD And they're in violent motion .PERIOD 
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything ,COMMA but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology ,COMMA and that is :COLON why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way ?QUESTIONMARK So they combine together and be catalyzed .PERIOD 
So they had created these artifacts .PERIOD 
So that's what lauren did .PERIOD 
Each time ,COMMA i click ,COMMA it ,COMMA car ,COMMA turn .PERIOD 
Teacher ,COMMA [choose] objects that you think will fall to the earth at the same time .PERIOD 
Who's got the apple .PERIOD 
We've done that already .PERIOD 
Galileo ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .PERIOD 
I'm focusing on biology ,COMMA the biological sciences .PERIOD 
And thereby hangs a tale .PERIOD 
You just have to look at the human genome project .PERIOD 
We're reading the book of life .PERIOD 
On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine .PERIOD And health care ,COMMA that's obvious .PERIOD 
What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .PERIOD 
That is going to be the it challenge of the next generation is communicating all this information .PERIOD 
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA didn't happen .PERIOD 
And pretty soon it's going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .PERIOD 
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away ,COMMA but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo .PERIOD 
People can try and ban these things .PERIOD 
Other people are going to say ,COMMA this is great .PERIOD 
And from the beginning of today's sessions ,COMMA you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible difficult ,COMMA painful period that we struggled through .PERIOD 
And i don't think that's what's going to happen .PERIOD 
They are going to think about it as this glorious instant when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future .PERIOD 
I have a daughter mulan .PERIOD 
It's our own pond ,COMMA and that's how it happens .PERIOD 
I know .PERIOD 
She's like what ?QUESTIONMARK And she goes ,COMMA but mom ,COMMA but men and women can't ever see each other naked mom .PERIOD 
Human males and females develop a special bond .PERIOD And when they're much older much ,COMMA much older than you ,COMMA and they have a very special feeling .PERIOD Then they can be naked together .PERIOD 
I don't understand the legs .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the internet has empowered us .PERIOD 
And as he came the second day ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA wow ,COMMA that's really a cartoon lover .PERIOD 
You will not like it .PERIOD 
This looks like a giant hamburger .PERIOD 
I was there to report on that story in cartoons .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe we don't have time for this right now .PERIOD 
Show the positive power of cartoons .PERIOD 
And i've been doing projects like this in <NUM> .PERIOD In lebanon ,COMMA this year in kenya ,COMMA back in january .PERIOD 
So this was a great project .PERIOD 
So i want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood .PERIOD 
If you go back two billion years ,COMMA you're not on an earth-like planet ,COMMA any more .PERIOD 
What we call an earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time .PERIOD 
We are right now ,COMMA in the beautiful oreo of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .PERIOD 
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit .PERIOD The second microbial age .PERIOD 
And that's the fate of a planet ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
All along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long ,COMMA slow climate change .PERIOD And that really changed in <NUM> .PERIOD In this rocky outcrop near gubbio ,COMMA where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks ,COMMA which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks ,COMMA above which held tertiary fossils .PERIOD 
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet .PERIOD 
This is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon .PERIOD 
But there's lots of stuff .PERIOD 
This is called paleontological child abuse .PERIOD 
And the what i think is that we returned ,COMMA over and over again to the pre-cambrian world ,COMMA that first microbial age ,COMMA and the microbes are still out there .PERIOD 
And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field .PERIOD 
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .PERIOD 
This is a tracking experiment .PERIOD And any of you scuba divers .PERIOD If you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever ,COMMA this is off the great barrier reef .PERIOD 
This is a great white shark that ate some of my traps .PERIOD 
We pulled it up up .PERIOD It comes so it's out there with me .PERIOD At night .PERIOD 
Tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries .PERIOD 
Now the same mouse is given <NUM> parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph .PERIOD And look what happens to its temperature .PERIOD 
Do we all have to have a little button saying ,COMMA let me die .PERIOD 
So what we're looking at now does it leave a signal .PERIOD 
It's simultaneously an incredible medical technique ,COMMA but also a terrifying .PERIOD 
This cell phone started its trajectory in an artisanal mine in the eastern congo .PERIOD 
And all of those products probably end their lives in a dump like this one in manila .PERIOD 
Some of these governance gaps are run by rogue states .PERIOD 
But right now ,COMMA most of the companies involved in these supply chains don't have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future .PERIOD Nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name .PERIOD Product .PERIOD 
Now i didn't come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain .PERIOD 
It's a pharmaceutical product .PERIOD 
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital ,COMMA probably squeaky clean .PERIOD 
So a couple of years ago ,COMMA we had a scandal which killed about <NUM> people around the world ,COMMA because of contaminants that crept into the heparin supply chain .PERIOD 
And the usfda has a jurisdictional problem .PERIOD 
But they are extremely efficient organizations .PERIOD 
You can call yourself responsible .PERIOD But responsibility without accountability often doesn't work .PERIOD 
Just look at pandemics -- swine flu ,COMMA bird flu ,COMMA h1n1 .PERIOD 
There are thousands of suppliers in there .PERIOD 
It seems too daunting ,COMMA too dangerous ,COMMA for any company to take on .PERIOD 
Please .PERIOD Ask them to treat us like human beings .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i appeal to you .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA there's a few heartbreaks that chocolate can't fix .PERIOD 
Your voice is small .PERIOD But don't ever stop singing .PERIOD 
But there are plenty of things .PERIOD I have trouble understanding .PERIOD 
Spoken word .PERIOD Poetry is the art of performance poetry .PERIOD 
And step three began when i realized that i didn't have to write poems that were indignant ,COMMA if that's not what i was .PERIOD 
And actually phil kaye ,COMMA and i coincidentally ,COMMA also share the same last name .PERIOD 
And the first list that i assign is <NUM> things ,COMMA i know to be true .PERIOD 
At a certain point ,COMMA you would realize that someone has the exact same thing ,COMMA or one thing very similar to something on your list .PERIOD 
And fourth ,COMMA someone has something you thought you knew everything about ,COMMA but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA charlotte ,COMMA it sounds pretty interesting to me .PERIOD 
Somebody once told me it's like walking through life like this .PERIOD 
And what was left of the city soon followed .PERIOD 
The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn into powder .PERIOD 
But in hiroshima ,COMMA some people were wiped clean away ,COMMA leaving only a wristwatch ,COMMA or a diary page .PERIOD 
In the original story ,COMMA god told sarah ,COMMA she could do something impossible ,COMMA and she laughed because the first sarah ,COMMA she didn't know what to do with impossible .PERIOD 
But on the front step ,COMMA a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone .PERIOD 
They not only recorded history ;SEMICOLON they helped change the course of history .PERIOD 
And as a reaction ,COMMA it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate ,COMMA thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda ,COMMA much ,COMMA as they would like to .PERIOD 
That was a tradition i wanted to follow .PERIOD 
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .PERIOD 
In <NUM> .PERIOD I went to northern ireland .PERIOD 
During the early '80s ,COMMA i spent a lot of time in central america which was engulfed by civil wars that straddled the ideological divide of the cold war .PERIOD 
He literally had nothing .PERIOD He was a virtual skeleton ;SEMICOLON yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move .PERIOD 
He had not given up and if he didn't give up ,COMMA how could anyone in the outside world ,COMMA ever dream of losing hope .PERIOD 
An aluminum factory in czechoslovakia was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust .PERIOD And four out of five workers came down with cancer .PERIOD 
When the story was published ,COMMA unsolicited donations poured in .PERIOD 
I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers .PERIOD 
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped ,COMMA whether by international ngos or by local grassroots organizations .PERIOD 
The international community still hasn't found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide .PERIOD 
I'd been photographing in the islamic world since <NUM> -- not only in the middle east ,COMMA but also in africa ,COMMA asia .PERIOD And europe .PERIOD 
For the first time in years ,COMMA shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage to karbala to observe ashura .PERIOD And i was amazed by the sheer number of people and how fervently they practiced their religion .PERIOD 
The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable .PERIOD 
Photographers ,COMMA go to the extreme edges of human experience ,COMMA to show people what's going on .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality .PERIOD 
So i will talk of what i remember as the most wonderful .PERIOD 
It's when the young couple whisper tonight we are going to make a baby .PERIOD 
Will the number of children increase each year up to <NUM> years ,COMMA or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?QUESTIONMARK 
So bear with our simplicity .PERIOD Now when i take you over to this shot .PERIOD 
And here ,COMMA the income per person in comparable dollars .PERIOD 
Otherwise ,COMMA it was only christian countries .PERIOD 
And by <NUM> we are actually <NUM> percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman .PERIOD 
But <NUM> years from now ,COMMA afghanistan will go from <NUM> million to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
It's an amazing improvement from seven children per woman .PERIOD They've gone all the way down to between four and five .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i do ,COMMA as i always do .PERIOD 
I went to the statistical authority of qatar to their webpage -- it's a very good webpage .PERIOD I recommend it -- and i looked up -- oh yeah ,COMMA you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge .PERIOD I found qatar's social trends .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA look ,COMMA again at this .PERIOD 
So what will happen now is quite straightforward .PERIOD 
Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote .PERIOD And we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .PERIOD 
So this is how you vote .PERIOD 
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .PERIOD 
And these are elections by the people for the people .PERIOD 
I was in india this past year ,COMMA and i may have seen the last cases of polio in the world .PERIOD 
And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated ,COMMA and that this was god's gift to humanity ,COMMA because of the hard work of dedicated scientists .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON early detection ,COMMA early response .PERIOD 
And india was the place where smallpox made its last ,COMMA stand .PERIOD 
You could vaccinate everybody in india .PERIOD But one year later ,COMMA there'll be <NUM> million new babies ,COMMA which was then the population of canada .PERIOD 
We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house .PERIOD 
This may be the year we eradicate polio -- that will make it the second disease in history .PERIOD 
I hope that you will take a look at it .PERIOD 
Would you get in an airplane with <NUM> people you didn't know ,COMMA coughing and sneezing ,COMMA when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you ,COMMA for which you had no antivirals or vaccine .PERIOD 
I asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza -- and i asked them the questions you'd like to ask them .PERIOD 
Within three weeks ,COMMA it will be everywhere in the world .PERIOD 
Let's increase the websites that they crawl from <NUM> to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
Then a number of years went by .PERIOD And there were a lot of rumors about bird flu .PERIOD 
They reported this to who who took a little while taking action ,COMMA because who will only receive a report from a government ,COMMA because it's the united nations .PERIOD 
Now what's really important is that ,COMMA before there was gphin <NUM> percent of all the world's reports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu .PERIOD Or you're talking about ebola -- <NUM> percent of all those reports came from nations .PERIOD 
The moment these guys in ottawa ,COMMA on a budget of <NUM> dollars a year ,COMMA got cracking ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all the reports in the world came from gphin .PERIOD <NUM> percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other <NUM> nations .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here's what's real interesting .PERIOD After they'd been working for a couple years ,COMMA what do you think happened to those nations ?QUESTIONMARK 
I was this weird ,COMMA little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses .PERIOD 
Take a breath right now of this clear air in this room .PERIOD 
They've made me a proud i-don't-know-it-all .PERIOD 
And we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated ,COMMA and you can use them too ,COMMA because i know you're all going to take an other to lunch .PERIOD 
My lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights ,COMMA and i'm going to share just one with you .PERIOD 
And since we had established some trust ,COMMA we believed in each other's sincerity .PERIOD 
We agreed .PERIOD We'd speak up in our own communities .PERIOD When we witnessed the kind of otherizing talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA we had taken first steps together ,COMMA past our knee-jerk reactions ,COMMA to the ubuntu place ,COMMA which is the only place where solutions to our most intractable-seeming problems will be found .PERIOD 
Because ubuntu work is slow ,COMMA and it's difficult .PERIOD 
It's two people .PERIOD Two warriors ,COMMA dropping their weapons .PERIOD And reaching toward each other .PERIOD 
In my life ,COMMA when i tried to achieve things like success or recognition ,COMMA they eluded me .PERIOD 
And it is for me ,COMMA a language which expressed the intangible ,COMMA and gives voice to people and stories without .PERIOD 
Joshua claims to have personally killed more than <NUM> people .PERIOD During liberia's civil war .PERIOD 
But what i saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness ,COMMA which i never thought possible .PERIOD 
I was intensely moved during all this .PERIOD 
And yes ,COMMA all of those people killed were male .PERIOD 
Many of the women are married with children ,COMMA and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children .PERIOD 
And when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response ,COMMA she said ,COMMA don't worry same thing back home .PERIOD 
We know how to deal with these fellows ,COMMA and ignored them .PERIOD 
Sometimes when the war is over and all the film crews have left ,COMMA the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .PERIOD 
They answer more than <NUM> calls in just two months .PERIOD 
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the dfs ,COMMA at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions ,COMMA read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire .PERIOD 
That's right .PERIOD Yeah .PERIOD Very rarely .PERIOD Do we ever know .PERIOD And if we find out at some stage ,COMMA then we destroy that information as soon as possible .PERIOD 
Wow :COLON so your leak ,COMMA really ,COMMA substantially changed the world .PERIOD 
Let me know when you've got them .PERIOD Let's shoot .PERIOD 
Hotel :COLON bushmaster ,COMMA two-six ,COMMA bushmaster two-six .PERIOD We need to move time .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
Two-six :COLON this is two-six .PERIOD We're mobile .PERIOD 
What was the key element of this :COLON that actually caused the outrage ,COMMA do you think .PERIOD 
I mean in general ,COMMA what's your philosophy .PERIOD 
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA we do get a lot of that .PERIOD 
But do you see any irony in the fact that ,COMMA in order for you to shine that light ,COMMA you have to yourself ,COMMA create secrecy around your sources .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA there might be a couple of views of wikileaks and of julian .PERIOD 
So late last year -- in november last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in albania ,COMMA like the well blowout in the gulf of mexico ,COMMA but not quite as big .PERIOD 
So under that basis ,COMMA we put it out and said ,COMMA look ,COMMA we're skeptical about this thing .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we're an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with .PERIOD So we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff .PERIOD And then lower security cases .PERIOD 
Can that be right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you were also -- i mean ,COMMA you were also a hacker at an early age ,COMMA and ran into the authorities early on .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this phrase is not not as nice as it used to be .PERIOD 
So just tell us very quickly in the last minute ,COMMA the story .PERIOD What happened in iceland .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA they publicized your side .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA no studies exist yet that show how or why .PERIOD 
But then one night my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner .PERIOD And i noticed that the edges of the chicken ,COMMA which had been marinated in lemon juice ,COMMA turned white .PERIOD 
And later in biology class ,COMMA i learned that it's due to a process called denaturing ,COMMA which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemically function .PERIOD 
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner .PERIOD 
And that was my first science fair project .PERIOD 
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects ,COMMA including a remote controlled garbage can .PERIOD 
And that's huge .PERIOD 
So that was my work ,COMMA and it was my way of reimagining the future for future research with figuring out exactly what this protein does ,COMMA but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness -- so maybe all grandfathers with cancer have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren .PERIOD 
But soon after i developed a novel mathematical model that essentially quantifies the effect of these environmental pollutants on the lung health of asthmatic patients .PERIOD 
And it surprises me that no model currently exists that quantifies the effect of environmental factors on human lung health ,COMMA because that relationship seems so important .PERIOD 
Because i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation ,COMMA we could also find a way to treat asthmatic patients more .PERIOD Effectively .PERIOD 
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant ,COMMA as defined by the us .PERIOD Clean air act .PERIOD 
So any user can come in here and click on lung function report .PERIOD And it'll take them to this report that i created .PERIOD 
My translation .PERIOD Medium is a very simple basket .PERIOD 
That means that it is the numbers that control the form ,COMMA not me .PERIOD 
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians .PERIOD 
This piece here is read very differently ,COMMA depending on where you place it .PERIOD

So ,COMMA after being interrogated by this japanese manager for a half an hour ,COMMA he finally said so miss yang .PERIOD Do you have any questions to ask me .PERIOD 
And sometimes i have young people approaching me say ,COMMA lan ,COMMA you changed my life ,COMMA and i feel proud of that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
So making a living is not that easy for young people .PERIOD 
And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment ,COMMA they figured out they have to work for <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA to afford their first apartment .PERIOD 
For those who do return back to the countryside ,COMMA they find themselves very welcome locally .PERIOD Because ,COMMA with the knowledge ,COMMA skills and networks ,COMMA they have learned in the cities .PERIOD With the assistance of the internet ,COMMA they're able to create more jobs ,COMMA upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .PERIOD 
And after hours of negotiation ,COMMA <NUM> dogs were rescued .PERIOD

I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .PERIOD 
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time ,COMMA being transformed themselves .PERIOD 
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way ,COMMA and maybe censors that natural curiosity ,COMMA or you know ,COMMA reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .PERIOD 
The doors open ,COMMA the kids descend on this table of legs .PERIOD And they are poking and prodding ,COMMA and they're wiggling toes .PERIOD And they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .PERIOD 
And immediately a voice shouted ,COMMA kangaroo .PERIOD

It's a conversation about augmentation .PERIOD 
As lord blackstone described it land is protected by trespass law ,COMMA for most of the history of trespass law .PERIOD By presuming it protects the land all the way down below and to an indefinite extent upward .PERIOD 
And bmi was much more democratic in the art that it would include within its repertoire ,COMMA including african american music for the first time in the repertoire .PERIOD 
In my view ,COMMA the most significant thing to recognize about what this internet is doing is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture that sousa romanticized .PERIOD 
White :COLON europeans were subject to the plague .PERIOD 
We can date it to <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms ,COMMA it may not turn out to be chips .PERIOD 
We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo .PERIOD 
And you can do strange things with this stuff .PERIOD This is a baby gar .PERIOD 
Now the last of these things died in september <NUM> .PERIOD 
And if we do that ,COMMA and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg ,COMMA we may give birth to an animal that hasn't walked the earth since <NUM> .PERIOD 
The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life .PERIOD 
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings ,COMMA and what the program is for those cells to differentiate ,COMMA one of the things we're going to be able to do is to stop undifferentiated cells ,COMMA which you know as cancer .PERIOD And one of the things we're going to learn how to do is how to reprogram cells like stem cells in such a way that they express bone ,COMMA stomach ,COMMA skin ,COMMA pancreas .PERIOD 
That's why sometimes a person's genes don't have to change a lot to get cancer .PERIOD 
Same thing with receptin :COLON if you've got breast cancer .PERIOD 
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on their ability to speak a language of life .PERIOD And you can watch new york fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch ,COMMA new jersey fall off a cliff ,COMMA and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence .PERIOD 
That's why nations rise and fall .PERIOD 
In the 1990s .PERIOD These are sovereign states that did not exist before .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD

We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here .PERIOD 
But harry's wife is confused because she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA harry had been packing his own lunch for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So i had a very inventive teacher :COLON a pakistani muslim who wanted to teach us about this .PERIOD 
I mean picture this -- really picture this .PERIOD 
We are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent :COLON the valuable resource of the imagination .PERIOD 
And we want to say to idris chop him up .PERIOD

The question is ,COMMA how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing .PERIOD 
As a young ,COMMA middle-class nigerian activist ,COMMA i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government .PERIOD 
I justified it ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA this is the cost of revolution .PERIOD 
Have i not myself been imprisoned .PERIOD 
And so they said ,COMMA tell me about africa ,COMMA professor abani .PERIOD 
There are no essential africans .PERIOD And most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else about the continent we come from .PERIOD And yet we want to make profound statements about it .PERIOD 
Gazelle i killed you for your skin's exquisite touch for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper .PERIOD

I watch that tv show .PERIOD 'lie to me' ,COMMA i know you're lying .PERIOD 
They use it to get to the truth ,COMMA and they do what mature leaders do everyday .PERIOD They have difficult conversations with difficult people ,COMMA sometimes during very difficult times .PERIOD

Deception .PERIOD Is actually serious business .PERIOD 
It's woven into the fabric of our daily .PERIOD And our business lives .PERIOD 
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language .PERIOD

Diane downs at night ,COMMA when i close my eyes i can see christie ,COMMA reaching her hand out to me ,COMMA while i'm driving ,COMMA and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .PERIOD

They fight ,COMMA they get back up ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wouldn't this be cool .PERIOD 
This is a clay maker .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur .PERIOD 
You can see how old this stuff is .PERIOD 
And i'm really not very good at it .PERIOD 
This is a -- you can see the little window there .PERIOD 
So this is a quick tale i'm going to tell .PERIOD This is the furby tale .PERIOD 
So this is my family .PERIOD 
I try to do a lot of philosophy ,COMMA a lot of thinking about all of these projects .PERIOD 
You can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor .PERIOD 
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic .PERIOD

And then she started doing these other images .PERIOD 
I have three girls ,COMMA and they just they -- it's like a rescue animal thing .PERIOD They're going there .PERIOD

And we're going to try to really pull this off ,COMMA intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive .PERIOD

And then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting .PERIOD And then more sculpting .PERIOD 
John :COLON do you want to bring him up .PERIOD

Now ,COMMA these are not robots ,COMMA they're kind of lovebots ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
We -- actually ,COMMA it's very hard to keep people from doing this .PERIOD 
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that .PERIOD 
If they can do that ,COMMA why can't governments and ngos do the same thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
So that's why i took a bit of time to study coke .PERIOD 
They have this very continuous feedback loop .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA you roll the ball .PERIOD You hear some pins go down .PERIOD 
It's dark ;SEMICOLON you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on .PERIOD And then you an see your impact .PERIOD 
Real-time .PERIOD Data turns on the lights .PERIOD 
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers ,COMMA and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people ,COMMA who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .PERIOD 
The government noticed in ethiopia ,COMMA that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic .PERIOD They were over a day's travel away from a health clinic .PERIOD 
The third component of :COLON coke's :COLON success is marketing .PERIOD 
Let's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin' flag by a somali hip hop artist .PERIOD 
And it went number one on the pop chart in <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop .PERIOD 
We know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by <NUM> percent in men .PERIOD 
But it turns out the men do because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it .PERIOD And the men also believe it improves their sex life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what's the endgame .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness ,COMMA i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother ,COMMA holding healthy baby in her arms .PERIOD 
To me ,COMMA that is deep happiness .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
This is my baseline :COLON this is the mediterranean coast with no fish ,COMMA bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae .PERIOD 
This is their baseline .PERIOD This is what they think is natural .PERIOD Because we started modern science with scuba diving .PERIOD Long after we started degrading marine ecosystems .PERIOD 
What have we learned from these places .PERIOD 
When we went to pristine reefs ,COMMA we realized that the natural world was upside down .PERIOD This pyramid was inverted .PERIOD 
The top head does account for most of the biomass in some places up to <NUM> percent ,COMMA like kingman reef ,COMMA which is now protected .PERIOD 
Then you go to palmyra atoll .PERIOD That has more biomass of herbivores ,COMMA and the dead corals are clean ,COMMA and the corals are coming back .PERIOD 
And this is what i saw lots of fish .PERIOD 
And this particular place ,COMMA the medes islands marine reserve is only <NUM> hectares ,COMMA and it brings <NUM> million euros to the local economy .PERIOD <NUM> times more than fishing ,COMMA and it represents <NUM> percent of all the tourist .PERIOD Revenue .PERIOD 
These places when we protect them ,COMMA if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby ,COMMA this is what happens .PERIOD 
The abundance ,COMMA how many fish you have per square meter ,COMMA increases almost <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
If you fish less ,COMMA you're actually catching more .PERIOD 
Another example :COLON nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef .PERIOD 
When i went there for the first time in <NUM> ,COMMA there were only <NUM> groupers left .PERIOD 
It happened in many places around the caribbean .PERIOD 
So how much of this do we have .PERIOD 
People are losing their jobs ,COMMA because the fisheries are collapsing .PERIOD 
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people ,COMMA where there is no social conflict ,COMMA where the political cost is really low .PERIOD And the economic cost is also low .PERIOD 
But what about the rest of the coast of the world ,COMMA where people live and make a living out of fishing .PERIOD 
How could <NUM> percent survive on <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain .PERIOD They reproduce very fast .PERIOD They grow really fast .PERIOD They produce millions of eggs .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA really ,COMMA our picture of a food pyramid is just -- we have to change that completely .PERIOD 
We think this is universal .PERIOD 
So the numbers you presented really are astonishing .PERIOD 
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back .PERIOD 
And if it were not for these places that show hope ,COMMA i don't think i could continue doing this job .PERIOD 
And the problem ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that we take the ocean for granted .PERIOD 
Most of the animals are in the oceans .PERIOD 
We use the submarine alvin ,COMMA and we use cameras .PERIOD And the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony .PERIOD 
Marcel proust said ,COMMA the true voyage of discovery is not so much .PERIOD In seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes .PERIOD 
It's got tentacles ,COMMA dangling ,COMMA swirling around like that .PERIOD 
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space ,COMMA that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored .PERIOD 
They're very little understood .PERIOD 
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .PERIOD 
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes .PERIOD 
And we're over the atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific ,COMMA nine degrees ,COMMA north .PERIOD 
Here's where bill's cameras ,COMMA really do shine .PERIOD 
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed ,COMMA hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .PERIOD 
Not only is it coming out of the earth -- so ,COMMA biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .PERIOD 
Oh .PERIOD Good .PERIOD Going .PERIOD 
This is a female of this kind of worm .PERIOD 
You watch ,COMMA it doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight .PERIOD 
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine ,COMMA alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents .PERIOD 
It's actually a light-sensing organ .PERIOD 
This one's several stories tall .PERIOD 
This stuff is toxic as hell .PERIOD By the way .PERIOD 
That's probably where we evolved from .PERIOD 
There's a fish sitting here .PERIOD 
Here's a crab with his claw .PERIOD Right at the end of that tube worm ,COMMA waiting for that worm to stick his head out .PERIOD 
The worms are growing inches per week .PERIOD 
Despite that these animals grow back in about a year's time .PERIOD 
Learn to manage it .PERIOD 
So i'd like to talk about why that is ,COMMA why that's such a calamity for society ,COMMA what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .PERIOD 
This is really destructive .PERIOD 
David :COLON milch :COLON creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this .PERIOD 
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in <NUM> minutes ,COMMA three commercial breaks and a laugh track .PERIOD 
In all seriousness ,COMMA here's an example from a physics textbook .PERIOD 
I'm sure we all agree ,COMMA that no problem worth solving is like that .PERIOD 
So i can diagnose the problem ,COMMA a little more specifically in math .PERIOD 
The math serves the conversation ;SEMICOLON the conversation doesn't serve the math .PERIOD 
I like this question ,COMMA it's about a water tank .PERIOD 
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD 
We need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Because actually ,COMMA radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best ,COMMA but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet ,COMMA latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional ,COMMA high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are .PERIOD 
We'll grow by six cities of <NUM> million people a year for the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world .PERIOD 
Or you can go to places like this .PERIOD 
This is kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in east africa .PERIOD 
Millions of people living here ,COMMA stretched over many kilometers .PERIOD 
They're private schools .PERIOD There are no state schools in slums .PERIOD 
It's not to do with electricity or water .PERIOD 
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone .PERIOD 
This is a place called the madangiri settlement colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about <NUM> minutes ,COMMA outside new delhi ,COMMA where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD 
Ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married .PERIOD 
This is the best you can get in hyderabad ,COMMA in indian education .PERIOD 
But they find it completely obvious to use computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make videos so on and so forth .PERIOD 
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation .PERIOD That education has a payoff .PERIOD 
That's too long ,COMMA if you're poor .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there ,COMMA and then often .PERIOD 
Our education systems ,COMMA you do all that stuff afterward .PERIOD If you're lucky sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music .PERIOD 
So el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning .PERIOD 
Taio :COLON rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning .PERIOD 
And i learned it from this guy who is an amazing character .PERIOD 
And it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .PERIOD 
And it's the same wherever you go .PERIOD 
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are .PERIOD 
Why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants .PERIOD 
There are big picture ,COMMA schools in the us ,COMMA and ,COMMA australia .PERIOD 
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school ;SEMICOLON they're in family and community .PERIOD What you also need ,COMMA definitely is more on the right hand side .PERIOD 
You need efforts to supplement schools .PERIOD 
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD 
But many people today -- philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors ,COMMA scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call the third act .PERIOD The last three decades of life .PERIOD 
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood .PERIOD 
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject .PERIOD 
Obviously there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth .PERIOD 
It was about a man named neil selinger -- <NUM> years ,COMMA old ,COMMA a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer's voice .PERIOD 
It's a terrible disease .PERIOD It's fatal .PERIOD 
If however ,COMMA we can go back and alter our relationship ,COMMA re-vision our relationship to past people and events .PERIOD Neural pathways can change .PERIOD 
I mean as girls ,COMMA we start off feisty -- yeah ,COMMA who says .PERIOD 
We have agency .PERIOD 
But very often many ,COMMA if not most of us ,COMMA when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding ,COMMA and that's more intelligent in a way because the pollen .PERIOD They don't need so much of it .PERIOD 
The insects and other species can take the pollen ,COMMA transfer it directly to where it's required .PERIOD 
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .PERIOD 
These are the anthers of a lily ,COMMA cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .PERIOD 
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that ,COMMA and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .PERIOD 
So not only has the fly ,COMMA not got the nectar from the mimic plant .PERIOD It's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant ,COMMA if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD 
And when the insect gets there and lands on it ,COMMA dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant .PERIOD If you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional .PERIOD 
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect ,COMMA even to us .PERIOD 
So flies ,COMMA love ,COMMA this .PERIOD 
They lay their eggs in it ,COMMA thinking ,COMMA it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die .PERIOD But the plant ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has benefited ,COMMA because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate .PERIOD The next flower -- fantastic .PERIOD 
This thing does something else ,COMMA which is unusual .PERIOD 
Recently ,COMMA a wise media theorist tweeted ,COMMA the 19th century culture ,COMMA was defined by the novel .PERIOD The 20th century culture was defined by the cinema .PERIOD And the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface .PERIOD 
And i believe this is going to prove true .PERIOD 
And that's us down there in la ,COMMA and long beach on the bottom .PERIOD 
This is baron .PERIOD Wolfgang von kempelen's mechanical chess ,COMMA playing machine .PERIOD 
And i think it's a pretty valid question .PERIOD 
He draws sheep after sheep .PERIOD 
So this is a clip from charlie chaplin's modern times .PERIOD 
That's all i'm getting paid for this .PERIOD 
So we resynthesized this song .PERIOD 
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice .PERIOD 
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted ,COMMA you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .PERIOD 
I'm sorry for this .PERIOD 
And this was seen by a director in la named james frost who said ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD 
And i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers ,COMMA but we also open sourced it .PERIOD And we made it released as a google code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .PERIOD 
So we thought ,COMMA this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash .PERIOD 
Collaborator five ,COMMA as much as is different from frame .PERIOD To frame ,COMMA it really is personal .PERIOD 
But there's a bunch of different styles .PERIOD 
There is a real problem with snobbery .PERIOD 
Imagine that snobbery is a distinctively uk .PERIOD Phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .PERIOD 
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .PERIOD 
Now :COLON the opposite of a snob is your mother .PERIOD 
Think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love .PERIOD 
We're told from many sources that anyone can achieve anything .PERIOD 
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position .PERIOD They please .PERIOD 
They own their success ,COMMA but they also own their failure .PERIOD 
But i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic .PERIOD It's an impossible dream .PERIOD 
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others ,COMMA and it exists .PERIOD 
And then are fit for ridicule .PERIOD 
Now is there any alternative to this .PERIOD 
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans ,COMMA and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
When banking is no longer so respectable ,COMMA we lose interest in banking .PERIOD 
But what i really want to stress is by all means ,COMMA success .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD 
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything ,COMMA and politicians always talk about justice .PERIOD 
But it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
It's a smiling face .PERIOD 
And when i said ,COMMA i'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim .PERIOD And we're coming into the dock after a long day ,COMMA and it's now night ,COMMA and we come in ,COMMA and it's <NUM> hours and <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and i can touch the dock .PERIOD And we're done ,COMMA the trainer says that's great .PERIOD 
Try going in with an armada .PERIOD Like we had of <NUM> people and five boats and cnn's crew ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And there are sharks .PERIOD 
And i gathered together ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA the world's leading experts in every possible way .PERIOD 
And a month ago ,COMMA the 23rd of september ,COMMA i stood on that shore ,COMMA and i looked across to that long ,COMMA long faraway horizon .PERIOD And i asked myself ,COMMA do you have it .PERIOD 
You're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles .PERIOD 
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment ,COMMA don't take it for granted .PERIOD Be ready ?QUESTIONMARK Because there's going to be pain .PERIOD There's going to be suffering .PERIOD 
After a couple of days ,COMMA three days ,COMMA you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .PERIOD 
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .PERIOD 
He's <NUM> years old ,COMMA very well-built ,COMMA lean ,COMMA he's six-foot ,COMMA five ,COMMA weighs <NUM> lbs .PERIOD And he is down .PERIOD 
I need help and i can't help diana .PERIOD 
The box jelly again -- all across the neck .PERIOD All across here .PERIOD 
We've got benadryl on board if i get stung .PERIOD I'll just grin and bear .PERIOD It .PERIOD 
And they have these long <NUM> to <NUM> to 50-ft .PERIOD Tentacles .PERIOD 
Henry :COLON what's your question .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit .PERIOD But yeah ,COMMA i know those guys .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA that's what you need .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
This hope is still alive .PERIOD 
Are you going to swim the atlantic .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA nope .PERIOD I didn't know .PERIOD 
And i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .PERIOD 
They come in a lot of different shapes .PERIOD 
So i'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD 
So i did a series of work where it was identical words in french ,COMMA and in english .PERIOD 
So if you don't know one of these languages ,COMMA it's instant learning .PERIOD 
It's all if .PERIOD 
And we can use them also as a safety net .PERIOD 
People tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations .PERIOD And i create a mindscape .PERIOD 
I was also interested in the physicality of this format ,COMMA because you have to walk to see it .PERIOD 
So it's like the different layers of what we are made of .PERIOD And what we present to the world as an identity .PERIOD 
Why do i call it a book .PERIOD 
After eight years of rejection ,COMMA i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA it's faceted glass in the bronx .PERIOD 
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .PERIOD 
It's a story ,COMMA about transformation and connections .PERIOD 
And here i've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .PERIOD 
And i wanted to give them an escape .PERIOD 
But the result is always to have stories .PERIOD 
And you get to think about yourself and your memories .PERIOD And before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD 
But lots of people now live to <NUM> or <NUM> unless they shake hands too much ,COMMA or something like that .PERIOD 
Which ,COMMA by chimpanzee standards is very good ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD 
And i guess ,COMMA i better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines ,COMMA and -- -- and the main idea is in fact ,COMMA that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you .PERIOD 
Any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
What has changed .PERIOD Our society has been wireless devices .PERIOD 
This is the first one .PERIOD This is an electrocardiogram .PERIOD 
In the future you're going to be ,COMMA checking all your vital signs ,COMMA all your vital signs :COLON your heart rhythm ,COMMA your blood pressure ,COMMA your oxygen ,COMMA your temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
If you're an expectant parent ,COMMA what about the ability to monitor ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA fetal heart rate ,COMMA or intrauterine contractions ,COMMA and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy ,COMMA and moving over into the time of delivery ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then ,COMMA as we go further today ,COMMA we have continuous glucose sensors .PERIOD 
I didn't have one of those ,COMMA but i got the fitbit .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA how many here have any problems with sleeping .PERIOD 
And the wake time is in orange .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so that's the first night .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA diabetes is one of the big ones .PERIOD 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .PERIOD 
One of the ones i just wanted to mention the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling .PERIOD 
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute .PERIOD And that's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm .PERIOD 
The wireless institute ,COMMA the west ,COMMA wireless health institute is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here .PERIOD This evening gary and mary west .PERIOD And i'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this .PERIOD 
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics ,COMMA new approaches to food .PERIOD 
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last <NUM> years ,COMMA is in any of those books .PERIOD 
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before .PERIOD 
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .PERIOD 
Well that first cutaway picture worked .PERIOD So we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's do some more .PERIOD 
Once you start cutting things in half ,COMMA you kind of get carried away .PERIOD So you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .PERIOD 
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on .PERIOD 
But to make them palatable ,COMMA we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire ,COMMA and photographed it like this .PERIOD 
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
As it comes out of the grinder ,COMMA you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes ,COMMA build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically .PERIOD 
Now watch closely this is popcorn .PERIOD I'll explain it here .PERIOD 
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .PERIOD 
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors .PERIOD 
And he is credited with doing over <NUM> of these public surgeries ,COMMA wandering around in europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number .PERIOD When you think that surgery must have been a last resort .PERIOD 
Joseph lister was aepsis's ,COMMA or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate ,COMMA to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons .PERIOD 
The :COLON mayo :COLON brothers ,COMMA came out to visit lister in europe .PERIOD 
Something so simple .PERIOD 
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery :COLON surgery ,COMMA with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD 
But there were casualties of this revolution .PERIOD 
They had to give up their wrists .PERIOD 
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .PERIOD 
Now what you put between those instruments ,COMMA and those hands ,COMMA is a large fairly complicated robot .PERIOD 
And since this was introduced in <NUM> ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis .PERIOD And it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome .PERIOD 
More useful than a solid gold surgeon .PERIOD But still ,COMMA it's a fairly big capital investment .PERIOD 
It has to be able to come off of the centerline and then be able to work back toward that centerline .PERIOD 
It's not so simple .PERIOD 
For the patient ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's transparent .PERIOD This is all they're going to see .PERIOD 
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this .PERIOD 
As we take these capabilities ,COMMA and we get to go to the next places ,COMMA we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be .PERIOD 
And i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways .PERIOD We also need to take our eyes in in new ways .PERIOD 
We need to see beyond the surface .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london .PERIOD 
And i'm going to admit to hubris .PERIOD 
It was mind-blowing .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors .PERIOD 
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments ,COMMA disease .PERIOD You name it .PERIOD You know .PERIOD It .PERIOD 
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law ,COMMA then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery .PERIOD 
All around the world ,COMMA i've been told an almost identical story .PERIOD 
They said that guy looked sketchy .PERIOD I was suspicious ,COMMA but my children were hungry .PERIOD 
We needed medicine .PERIOD 
Ten miles <NUM> miles .PERIOD <NUM> miles later ,COMMA they find themselves in dirty ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA demeaning work .PERIOD 
Africans and indians as usual ,COMMA south americans and eastern europeans in particular ,COMMA are on our buy list .PERIOD 
D :COLON interesting ,COMMA micheal .PERIOD Bottom line .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK Do you recommend .PERIOD 
Kevin .PERIOD Bales :COLON okay .PERIOD You figured it out .PERIOD That's a spoof .PERIOD 
Slaves cost between <NUM> to <NUM> dollars in north america .PERIOD But i could take you places in india or nepal ,COMMA where human beings can be acquired for five or <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups .PERIOD 
You buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up .PERIOD And then when you're done with them ,COMMA you just throw them away .PERIOD 
I've got to say one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to .PERIOD And i want to introduce you to one of those .PERIOD 
This is not james .PERIOD This is one of the kids that he works with .PERIOD 
And it can be done .PERIOD 
Liberation and more importantly ,COMMA all the work that comes after liberation .PERIOD 
This is what liberation really looks like .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA no ,COMMA because we've got hope now .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD 
Despite the new york times' and vanity fair's best efforts .PERIOD Recently ,COMMA they're not brothers .PERIOD 
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had .PERIOD 
There is a picture of charles .PERIOD So let's watch the next clip .PERIOD 
But people live on this land .PERIOD 
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture .PERIOD 
And i'm really here to talk about design .PERIOD 
And this is a little film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair .PERIOD 
Because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that .PERIOD 
This is a relatively famous chair .PERIOD 
But doing these splints ,COMMA they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD 
I'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images .PERIOD 
This is a house that charles and ray designed .PERIOD 
My sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD It's not me .PERIOD 
Although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary ,COMMA it's not me .PERIOD 
The house is <NUM> .PERIOD 
And now i'm going to test you .PERIOD 
I hope you had a nice time at buddy's party .PERIOD 
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world .PERIOD 
And then embassy row is actually a historical site ,COMMA because in the kymaerican story ,COMMA this is where the parisian diaspora started ,COMMA where there embassy was .PERIOD 
And the town has really embraced it .PERIOD 
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica .PERIOD 
And this is cranbrook .PERIOD I've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that charles ever made .PERIOD 
And he made it for the <NUM> faculty exhibition .PERIOD 
You want to learn how to make films .PERIOD Go ,COMMA make a movie .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design ,COMMA was with them from the beginning .PERIOD 
It wasn't like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful .PERIOD 
So we're going to do the last clip .PERIOD 
And part of why this stuff is important ,COMMA and all the things that we do are important is that these are the ideas we need .PERIOD 
And working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer ,COMMA i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find ,COMMA took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that ,COMMA inside this object ,COMMA which i'd bought for just <NUM> pounds ,COMMA there were <NUM> different bits ,COMMA made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD 
Can i come up and get some iron .PERIOD 
But after some nagging ,COMMA i got him to do that .PERIOD 
But instead of a bellows ,COMMA i had a leaf blower .PERIOD 
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods .PERIOD 
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants .PERIOD But also from starches .PERIOD 
So this is attempting to make potato starch plastic .PERIOD 
And it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry .PERIOD And unfortunately i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato .PERIOD 
So kind of out of desperation .PERIOD I decided that i could think laterally .PERIOD 
And there it is on the shelves .PERIOD 
I don't know if you could see ,COMMA but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD 
They were trying to catch fish .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
Voice .PERIOD <NUM> :COLON it's coming again .PERIOD Voice !EXCLAMATIONMARK <NUM> :COLON new wave .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA if you think about something like google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web ,COMMA to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that .PERIOD And it does that because ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the world wide web actually has a remarkable order ,COMMA or a remarkable intelligence in it .PERIOD 
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective ,COMMA distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .PERIOD 
A network is not just the product of its component ,COMMA parts .PERIOD 
It is something more than that .PERIOD 
And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere .PERIOD And it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful ,COMMA decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD 
When we talk about bottom-up ,COMMA decentralized phenomena ,COMMA the ant colony is the classic metaphor ,COMMA because no individual ant knows what it's doing .PERIOD But collectively ,COMMA ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions .PERIOD 
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies .PERIOD 
It makes a huge difference .PERIOD 
And moore's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing .PERIOD 
When that comes to an end ,COMMA we'll go to the sixth paradigm ,COMMA three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits .PERIOD 
The great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD 
And i was asked ,COMMA well ,COMMA aren't you nervous .PERIOD 
And the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics ,COMMA comes down about every year .PERIOD 
But that was really right on schedule .PERIOD 
Communication technologies ,COMMA <NUM> different ways to measure this .PERIOD The number of bits being moved around the size of the internet .PERIOD 
Some .PERIOD Critics ,COMMA say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA software is stuck in the mud .PERIOD 
When i was a student it was across campus ,COMMA now it's in our pockets .PERIOD 
All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion .PERIOD 
Here is our founding meeting .PERIOD 
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders ,COMMA the high-tech leaders ,COMMA particularly google and nasa .PERIOD 
Whole arm .PERIOD Shoulder .PERIOD Disarticulation .PERIOD 
Not in an envelope of a human arm with <NUM> degrees of freedom ,COMMA from your shoulder to your fingertips .PERIOD 
You think ,COMMA it's bad to lose one arm .PERIOD 
We have <NUM> out of the <NUM> degrees of freedom .PERIOD You don't need the ones in the last two fingers .PERIOD 
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed ,COMMA which is unfortunately more in the news these days .PERIOD 
It's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans ,COMMA and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it and paint it in 3d -- exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD 
This weighs <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .PERIOD 
That's about <NUM> percent of our global needs and <NUM> percent of some island nations .PERIOD 
It all began when two scientists ,COMMA fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole ,COMMA massachusetts where both were guests at the famed ,COMMA oceanographic institute .PERIOD 
They ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA are an endangered species themselves .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA fishermen could only catch what they could either eat ,COMMA or sell that day .PERIOD 
But this is no laughing matter .PERIOD 
That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago .PERIOD 
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific .PERIOD 
For animals that don't surface ,COMMA we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light .PERIOD And what time the sun rises and sets .PERIOD 
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .PERIOD 
And so they put this together a list of all the species where they're known to occur .PERIOD And it really seemed like a very esoteric ,COMMA scientific type of exercise .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover ,COMMA how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in .PERIOD The coming years are likely to be resolved .PERIOD 
You can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA this golden v kelp collected in alaska ,COMMA just below the low water ,COMMA mark is probably a new species .PERIOD 
This particular shrimp .PERIOD We've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp ?QUESTIONMARK It's thought to have gone extinct .PERIOD <NUM> years ago -- at least it was until the census discovered .PERIOD It was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this little critter ,COMMA it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic .PERIOD 
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island .PERIOD 
That means <NUM> percent ,COMMA even after the census still remain to be discovered .PERIOD 
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are .PERIOD 
A single drop of seawater ;SEMICOLON could contain <NUM> different types of microbes .PERIOD 
The other point i'd like to make about this ,COMMA is that this ocean's interconnected .PERIOD 
Census scientists worked in the rain ,COMMA they worked in the cold ,COMMA they worked under water ,COMMA and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery ,COMMA the still vast unknown ,COMMA the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in new york city ,COMMA or whether you're a tedster living in edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter .PERIOD 
♫ i could show the world how to smile ♫ ♫ i could be glad all of the while ♫ ♫ i could turn the gray skies to blue ,COMMA if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could leave the old days behind ♫ ♫ leave all my pals i’d never mind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could start my life all anew ,COMMA if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could climb the snow-capped mountains .PERIOD ♫ ♫ sail the mighty ocean wide .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could cross the burning desert ,COMMA if i had you by my side .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could be a king ,COMMA dear ,COMMA uncrowned ,COMMA humble or poor ,COMMA rich or renowned .PERIOD ♫ ♫ there is nothing i couldn’t do .PERIOD If i had you .PERIOD ♫ thank you .PERIOD Well ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD 
And there's a cause for that all right .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's been around for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And we do something different than what we did in the past .PERIOD We add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .PERIOD 
If there are <NUM> operations ,COMMA you know that none of them work .PERIOD 
You've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with kuhnian paradigms .PERIOD 
And by the human spirit ,COMMA i don't mean anything divine ,COMMA i don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic .PERIOD 
What i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA perhaps we were not capable of .PERIOD 
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days .PERIOD 
So if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the united states -- becomes our patient .PERIOD 
I would like to quote one of my own household gods .PERIOD 
Think about it .PERIOD 
Rudimentary :COLON animal has a nervous system ,COMMA swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life .PERIOD 
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today ,COMMA the answer is simple .PERIOD The child wins ,COMMA easily .PERIOD 
When it comes to being dexterous ,COMMA it's not even clear what the algorithm is .PERIOD You have to solve to be dexterous .PERIOD 
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .PERIOD 
And it sounds like an easy problem .PERIOD 
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear ,COMMA that was the noise .PERIOD 
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick ,COMMA our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars .PERIOD 
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities .PERIOD 
But there's another source of information ,COMMA and that's effectively prior knowledge .PERIOD 
But you know that your senses are not perfect ,COMMA and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between <NUM> and maybe <NUM> .PERIOD 
That information is available in the current shot ,COMMA but there's another source of information not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis .PERIOD And that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match .PERIOD 
As we go around ,COMMA we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down .PERIOD But we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is .PERIOD And then combine those in a real bayesian way .PERIOD 
So that really means i have to make predictions of the future .PERIOD 
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external .PERIOD 
So as i go around the world ,COMMA i'm making predictions of what i should get ,COMMA subtracting them off .PERIOD 
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay .PERIOD 
And based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD 
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD 
So if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated .PERIOD 
Now we don't work with children ;SEMICOLON we don't work with hitting .PERIOD But the concept is identical .PERIOD 
We started with a motor with a little lever ,COMMA a little force transfuser .PERIOD 
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions ,COMMA and fundamentally changes the precepts .PERIOD 
But we've got a problem .PERIOD 
And there's a big gap between the task and the movement system .PERIOD 
I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths .PERIOD 
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way .PERIOD 
But there's noise added to this .PERIOD 
So if i pick the same command through many times ,COMMA i will get a different noisy version each time ,COMMA because noise changes each time .PERIOD 
And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements ,COMMA so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise .PERIOD 
So you want to avoid big forces ,COMMA as one principle .PERIOD 
So we've shown that using this ,COMMA we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements ,COMMA so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .PERIOD 
All the conversation stopped .PERIOD All the eyes turned to me .PERIOD 
And so what i'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD 
They put smart skylights through their stores ,COMMA so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands .PERIOD 
So let me tell you this .PERIOD When wal-mart achieves <NUM> percent energy reductions ,COMMA that's going to be a very big deal ,COMMA but i'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA bob said ,COMMA the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear .PERIOD In sacramento california .PERIOD That we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california .PERIOD 
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from .PERIOD 
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline .PERIOD 
So what's happened in brazil is they've replaced <NUM> percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet .PERIOD With ethanol .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a team of berkeley researchers with <NUM> million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient ,COMMA called artemisinin ,COMMA and they're going to make that drug <NUM> times cheaper .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i'll tell you -- a lot .PERIOD 
Second fact ,COMMA the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total .PERIOD 
Third fact ,COMMA i bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years .PERIOD And the federal budget calls for a measly <NUM> million dollars of r&ampd in geothermal energy .PERIOD 
Not enough to stabilize the climate .PERIOD 
Not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean .PERIOD 
We've got to make this economic ,COMMA so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome .PERIOD 
It is the mother of all markets .PERIOD You remember that .PERIOD Internet .PERIOD 
She's like ,COMMA oh us .PERIOD I'm like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA all right ,COMMA that's cool .PERIOD 
And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for lego because lego -- the danish -- no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD 
But the americans ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for lego .PERIOD No problem .PERIOD 
And at a certain point you look around ,COMMA you're like ,COMMA whoa !EXCLAMATIONMARK This is a really nerdy crowd .PERIOD 
I'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and i'm going to stop being embarrassed .PERIOD 
And so this is like this cad program where you build it .PERIOD 
I have to take a moment .PERIOD 
There's a whole gray market for lego thousands of home-based businesses .PERIOD 
Let's see here .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> million years per minute .PERIOD 
So this is frozen water .PERIOD 
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we've obtained of mars ,COMMA was released earlier this year in the magazine ,COMMA science .PERIOD 
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane ,COMMA ch4 in the atmosphere of mars .PERIOD 
That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .PERIOD 
And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites .PERIOD 
Here's hellas basin ,COMMA a very ,COMMA very different place ,COMMA geologically .PERIOD 
We addressed on the board ,COMMA the major questions that have not been answered .PERIOD 
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane ,COMMA we call ares .PERIOD 
And our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars .PERIOD 
How do we transport an airplane to mars .PERIOD 
And we have it in something called an aeroshell .PERIOD 
Because we have tested ares model ,COMMA several models ,COMMA in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center .PERIOD For eight years under mars conditions .PERIOD 
We're ready to go .PERIOD 
This is the ares team we have about <NUM> scientists ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA where we're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard ,COMMA space flight center ,COMMA ames ,COMMA research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
And my colleague ,COMMA james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical ,COMMA social ,COMMA biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives .PERIOD 
They actually diffuse through networks .PERIOD 
You could have friendship relationships ,COMMA sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships ,COMMA co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor relationships .PERIOD And the like .PERIOD 
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ;SEMICOLON or by their neighbors .PERIOD 
Nicholas :COLON christakis !EXCLAMATIONMARK B :COLON it's obvious .PERIOD 
And what we show here is -- like here -- very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here .PERIOD And here's the peak of the epidemic .PERIOD 
And if they nominate the party host as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore has more friends than they do .PERIOD 
So we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week .PERIOD 
By monitoring ,COMMA the friends group we could get <NUM> days ,COMMA advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students .PERIOD 
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for <NUM> days .PERIOD 
Every dot is a person .PERIOD And every line represents a volume of calls between the people .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what i would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD 
They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population ,COMMA understand what's happening in the population ,COMMA and intervene in the population for the better .PERIOD 
One is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example i gave where we get ,COMMA some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu or not -- and then get warning .PERIOD 
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD 
They were gone in an instant .PERIOD 
The royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson .PERIOD 
Let me leave you with a final thought .PERIOD 
And that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists .PERIOD 
It will refer you directly to your congressperson ,COMMA to your us senator ,COMMA to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court ,COMMA which the bush administration doesn't like .PERIOD 
He moved with the headlines .PERIOD 
But :COLON uh-oh :COLON the killers are within the camps .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room .PERIOD 
You're un-owned .PERIOD 
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers ,COMMA he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say you're violating .PERIOD This is the un .PERIOD Charter .PERIOD 
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room .PERIOD 
There's going to be a lot of people .PERIOD 
But it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby ,COMMA and she had no milk to nurse .PERIOD 
A hundred years ago we didn't .PERIOD 
At our time in history ,COMMA these images are out of place .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA is more than hiv/aids :COLON malaria and tuberculosis combined .PERIOD 
And here ,COMMA you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another ,COMMA neglected ,COMMA and who was deeply malnourished .PERIOD 
And so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment ,COMMA and teaching them about breastfeeding .PERIOD 
It doesn't need to be refrigerated .PERIOD It doesn't need water which is often lacking .PERIOD 
Eighty percent of the people in the world ,COMMA have no food safety net .PERIOD 
And usually the institutions -- churches ,COMMA temples ,COMMA other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net .PERIOD 
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD 
Many kids in the world can't go to school ,COMMA because they have to go beg and find a meal .PERIOD 
It costs less than <NUM> cents a day to change a kid's life .PERIOD 
Families need the help .PERIOD 
So is this :COLON a hopeless cause .PERIOD 
Cameroon !EXCLAMATIONMARK Northern cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .PERIOD 
Food aid coming in every year when people are starving during the lean seasons .PERIOD 
You manage the village manages .PERIOD These warehouses .PERIOD 
And the food banks are growing .PERIOD 
We're seeing that now in the horn of africa ,COMMA where food prices are up ,COMMA <NUM> percent in some areas over last year .PERIOD 
The shopkeepers are hiring more people .PERIOD 
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .PERIOD 
I've gone out there .PERIOD I've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this .PERIOD 
You look at the cost-benefit analysis .PERIOD And my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world and say ,COMMA we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate ,COMMA affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD 
When a leader says ,COMMA not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change .PERIOD 
Wfp's been able to leave <NUM> nations ,COMMA because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD 
Not only that transforming hunger is an opportunity .PERIOD But i think we have to change our mindsets .PERIOD 
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project .PERIOD 
The cancer genome atlas is coming out now .PERIOD 
There's also a field of proteomics ,COMMA that i'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD 
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD 
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA if i measured your temperature over <NUM> days ,COMMA and i asked ,COMMA what was the average temperature .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD 
So our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago .PERIOD 
That is the most effective ,COMMA cost-effective ,COMMA best way we can do things today .PERIOD 
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate -- which i just also did -- and your brainwaves .PERIOD 
It has the frequency of roughly <NUM> cycles per minute .PERIOD 
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .PERIOD 
You all recognize that one .PERIOD This is the most-played tune in the world today .PERIOD 
Why are we doing this .PERIOD 
The first is it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society .PERIOD And i think that it is a key step in evolution .PERIOD 
And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain .PERIOD But in fact ,COMMA most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .PERIOD 
They are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic .PERIOD And so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony ,COMMA which is unthinkable for us .PERIOD 
They choose very carefully who they connect with .PERIOD 
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons .PERIOD We came across .PERIOD 
And we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species .PERIOD 
So let's switch it on .PERIOD But to do it ,COMMA what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD 
There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .PERIOD 
Here we activate it .PERIOD And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain .PERIOD When there is a stimulation .PERIOD 
We can ask ,COMMA where is it inside ?QUESTIONMARK If we stimulate it with a picture .PERIOD 
Fifty years ago ,COMMA when i began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one -- not jacques perrin ,COMMA not jacques cousteau or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it ;SEMICOLON or by what we took out of it .PERIOD 
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in <NUM> years we've lost -- actually we've taken ,COMMA we've eaten -- more than <NUM> percent of the big fish in the sea .PERIOD Why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared .PERIOD Why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying .PERIOD But it really should concern you .PERIOD 
I'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls ,COMMA tomorrow's child :COLON asking why ;SEMICOLON we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .PERIOD 
For me as a scientist ,COMMA it all began in <NUM> .PERIOD When i first tried scuba .PERIOD 
Since then ,COMMA i've used about <NUM> kinds of submarines ,COMMA and i've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .PERIOD 
And i'm living proof .PERIOD 
No matter where on earth ,COMMA you live .PERIOD 
Over time ,COMMA most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes .PERIOD 
You did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt .PERIOD 
We need new deep-diving submarines .PERIOD 
That's bad news for us ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .PERIOD 
Millions of tons of discarded ,COMMA fishing nets ,COMMA gear that continues to kill .PERIOD 
We're still killing bluefin tuna ,COMMA truly endangered ,COMMA and much more valuable alive than dead .PERIOD 
Using google earth you can witness trawlers -- in china ,COMMA the north sea ,COMMA the gulf of mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system ,COMMA leaving plumes of death in their path .PERIOD 
Together ,COMMA we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole .PERIOD 
Now many of you are probably saying ,COMMA wait a sec .PERIOD Is this tough to do .PERIOD 
You'll be in a massive headwind .PERIOD 
Virtually none all of our equipment ,COMMA including film equipment ,COMMA was charged by the sun .PERIOD 
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture .PERIOD That's the 130-foot diameter library .PERIOD That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship .PERIOD 
Two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space :COLON trips to satellites of the outer planets august <NUM> <NUM> .PERIOD 
And that's why ,COMMA when you get something declassified ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
This is ed day putting .PERIOD So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA thanks to him .PERIOD 
And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad .PERIOD 
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home .PERIOD And after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed basically gave me .PERIOD 
And one part of nasa was interested in it .PERIOD But the headquarters in nasa they killed the project .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA finally ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to <NUM> and then all those paths came to a halt .PERIOD 
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .PERIOD 
And to the extent ,COMMA you believe i didn't shrink the lines ,COMMA which i didn't ,COMMA i've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving .PERIOD You .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA it's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .PERIOD 
Turns out that they got to <NUM> percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .PERIOD 
When you walk into the dmv ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing .PERIOD 
What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK Do you pull the patient back and try ?QUESTIONMARK Ibuprofen .PERIOD 
The other group of the physicians ,COMMA they said yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered .PERIOD There were two medications you didn't try out yet ,COMMA ibuprofen and piroxicam .PERIOD 
Now :COLON think of it .PERIOD This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD 
The thing is ,COMMA is that no physician would ever say piroxicam ,COMMA ibuprofen .PERIOD Hip replacement .PERIOD 
An online subscription for <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
These are the market share .PERIOD Most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD 
The answer was absolutely yes .PERIOD 
Now you're getting it .PERIOD 
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here .PERIOD 
These :COLON <NUM> million cellular radio masts ,COMMA or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy .PERIOD 
And that creates a big problem .PERIOD 
It's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body .PERIOD 
And multiply that by <NUM> then you end up at <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
Not usable for a youtube video .PERIOD 
And the light goes through that hole .PERIOD 
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .PERIOD 
And not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside .PERIOD 
So what happens when i switch on that light .PERIOD 
But at the same time ,COMMA you see this video coming up here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA no one ,COMMA if i have a light here ,COMMA if i have secure data ,COMMA no ,COMMA one on the other side of this room ,COMMA through that wall would be able to read that data .PERIOD 
So for me ,COMMA the applications of it to me ,COMMA are beyond imagination ,COMMA at the moment .PERIOD 
And they use light to illuminate space down there .PERIOD 
If you saw <NUM> ,COMMA a space odyssey ,COMMA and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom .PERIOD And you saw the monolith .PERIOD You know ,COMMA that was arthur c .PERIOD Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years in particular ,COMMA have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology ,COMMA and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools .PERIOD 
And we've seen many seminal moments .PERIOD 
You're walking around ,COMMA your car has <NUM> microprocessors .PERIOD 
Then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together .PERIOD We flatten the world .PERIOD 
The dna is organized in words .PERIOD Call them .PERIOD Genes and chromosomes .PERIOD 
Dna is a very elegant molecule .PERIOD 
This here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD 
What is the code .PERIOD 
Then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .PERIOD 
For my wife eat three times as much ,COMMA and you never put on any weight .PERIOD 
It's all hidden in this code .PERIOD And it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace .PERIOD 
We can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries .PERIOD What creates the starchiness inside of a grain ,COMMA why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
We can also look at ,COMMA at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them .PERIOD 
Now you have the genome and you say to yourself .PERIOD So ,COMMA if i plug this synthetic genome -- if i pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live .PERIOD 
And this is extremely profound .PERIOD 
So then what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
We can start to figure that out .PERIOD 
And he had the best answer i ever heard to this question .PERIOD Well ,COMMA somebody has to .PERIOD 
You cannot compete with the environment .PERIOD If you have an adolescent dog's brain .PERIOD 
Go on something should happen .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA we go puppy ,COMMA sit -- boom .PERIOD It's got it in six to <NUM> trials .PERIOD 
He'll find jamie ,COMMA wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream or something ,COMMA and take him a little message that says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA dinner's ready !EXCLAMATIONMARK Come in for dinner .PERIOD 
So at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do .PERIOD 
The dog lives with you .PERIOD The dog can get you any time .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do .PERIOD And this is very easy .PERIOD 
And what we're doing in essence ,COMMA is we're teaching the dog ,COMMA kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us .PERIOD 
And now the dog's really happy .PERIOD 
There's several definitions of what a punishment is .PERIOD But one definition ,COMMA the most popular is a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior ,COMMA such that it's less likely to occur in the future .PERIOD 
The dog is actually euthanized now .PERIOD But this was a dog i worked with for a while .PERIOD 
When the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say ,COMMA rover ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat .PERIOD 
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?QUESTIONMARK 
Rover :COLON come here .PERIOD Rover .PERIOD Come here .PERIOD You son of a bitch .PERIOD 
And i went ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA do i do something .PERIOD 
The husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
You see it ,COMMA especially ,COMMA in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee .PERIOD 
And this i would say ,COMMA is the biggest human foible that we have .PERIOD 
Your kids are easy to train .PERIOD 
We think how we do it -- one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant .PERIOD And then we're raising the most important thing in life .PERIOD A child .PERIOD 
And it concludes in something that you see here ,COMMA that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD 
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility .PERIOD 
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building .PERIOD 
So that was the core idea .PERIOD 
So once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that this sort of core concept could work .PERIOD 
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram .PERIOD Those are the boxes .PERIOD 
That skin serves double duty ,COMMA again for economics .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's an unusual building for a public library .PERIOD Obviously .PERIOD 
That was the main sort of technology area in the building .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA dizzy ,COMMA yet .PERIOD 
And it allowed us to go back to first principles .PERIOD And redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD 
They came to us ,COMMA and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said ,COMMA we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville .PERIOD That's our main goal .PERIOD 
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD 
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art .PERIOD But it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate ,COMMA interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within .PERIOD 
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings .PERIOD And a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD 
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool .PERIOD So they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA you're <NUM> .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
And i tried ,COMMA and i made it .PERIOD 
And you made it out of what .PERIOD 
And so and that windmill ,COMMA what -- it worked .PERIOD 
Yeah .PERIOD 
So what did they make of -- that you were <NUM> <NUM> at the time -- what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK They were impressed .PERIOD 
Yeah .PERIOD 
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village .PERIOD 
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .PERIOD 
♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a -- all right .PERIOD I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- -- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction .PERIOD 
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from ,COMMA it gets ugly .PERIOD 
The oil was running out and a nuclear winter ,COMMA would finish us off ?QUESTIONMARK 
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .PERIOD 
Homo erectus made the same tool for <NUM> generations .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days .PERIOD 
It's an extraordinary phenomenon ,COMMA but it's true .PERIOD 
And more than that ,COMMA it's a confection of different ideas .PERIOD The idea of plastic ,COMMA the idea of a laser ,COMMA the idea of transistors .PERIOD 
One goes extinct for the other to survive .PERIOD 
So what sex does is ,COMMA it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .PERIOD 
So ;SEMICOLON oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .PERIOD 
Ask yourself ,COMMA how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening ,COMMA to read a book by .PERIOD 
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained since <NUM> as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else .PERIOD Or you can acquire another good or service .PERIOD 
They were a highly intelligent species .PERIOD 
The reason because tierra del fuego ,COMMA is separated from south america by a much narrower straight ,COMMA and there was trading contact across that straight throughout <NUM> years .PERIOD 
The tasmanians were isolated .PERIOD 
It's not the same with language .PERIOD 
With language ,COMMA we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other .PERIOD 
There will be wars .PERIOD There will be depressions .PERIOD There will be natural disasters .PERIOD 
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously ,COMMA on a collective level .PERIOD 
And as individuals ,COMMA we all do these things .PERIOD All the time ,COMMA everyday .PERIOD 
It's like when you're mean to your wife because you're mad at somebody else .PERIOD 
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt ,COMMA or whatever .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> minutes of our cup consumption .PERIOD 
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life ,COMMA that's the size .PERIOD It would be .PERIOD 
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .PERIOD 
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it .PERIOD 
And strangely enough ,COMMA the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction .PERIOD And most of that is being done by men .PERIOD 
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues .PERIOD 
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine .PERIOD 
But evolution is a balance :COLON where you have fast change ,COMMA you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change .PERIOD 
And so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and i'm going to show you data now .PERIOD 
Down here you can see slower evolution ,COMMA less diversity .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so that's what we did ,COMMA but how are we going to do that .PERIOD 
If you've got enough money to buy just a camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too .PERIOD And so we put a deep how-to guide on the web ,COMMA totally free ,COMMA with basically order-off-the-shelf parts .PERIOD 
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip .PERIOD 
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here .PERIOD It's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD 
That's me ,COMMA getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses .PERIOD Even when you're walking around healthy .PERIOD 
So that's great ,COMMA but again ,COMMA cheap ,COMMA shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we built out the chip .PERIOD 
Now we're using this chip ,COMMA and what are we using it for .PERIOD 
And this is what this looks like .PERIOD 
And that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with .PERIOD 
So let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD 
They did a ct scan .PERIOD 
Switch antibiotics :COLON so they switched to another antibiotic tamiflu .PERIOD 
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it .PERIOD 
And why is that just lore :COLON there's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD 
It doesn't make sense -- unless maybe there's a virus .PERIOD 
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses .PERIOD 
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses .PERIOD 
This was all done by folks in the lab -- i cannot take credit for most of this .PERIOD 
I'm talking about the production of aluminum .PERIOD 
The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water ,COMMA but rather salt .PERIOD That's melted .PERIOD 
So now how to choose the metals .PERIOD 
I felt the thrill of realization when i knew i'd come upon the answer .PERIOD 
It's pretty cool ,COMMA at least in theory .PERIOD 
We go to the laboratory .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA i hire a student and mentor him ,COMMA teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose .PERIOD 
And i was able to attract really ,COMMA really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society ,COMMA not science and service for career building .PERIOD 
I went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song .PERIOD 
♫ black men go to aspen .PERIOD ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least .PERIOD ♫ are you .PERIOD 
And since they discovered those things ,COMMA it really stuck with them so much more .PERIOD And also they would experience their own failures .PERIOD There was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD It was very important .PERIOD 
And another thing that really impressed me ,COMMA a long time ago ,COMMA was powers of ten :COLON charles and ray eames' film .PERIOD 
And so i'm going to show you a toy today that i've been working on that i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy .PERIOD 
Now we actually play through many generations here at the cellular scale .PERIOD 
But basically this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD So it has a little spine .PERIOD 
But really ,COMMA the goal here was ,COMMA within about a minute i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA now i'll put some hands on it .PERIOD 
And i can see how it might dance .PERIOD 
I can also play with the dynamics of this world ,COMMA over time .PERIOD 
And our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA it is .PERIOD Some indigenous life down here .PERIOD 
You see now ,COMMA they've actually gone to tribal dynamics .PERIOD 
I think i'll leave before they get hostile .PERIOD 
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here .PERIOD 
Because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking .PERIOD And the fact that it is so hard for us to think ,COMMA <NUM> <NUM> or <NUM> years out .PERIOD 
And so i'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .PERIOD 
What's in it for the ant .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA it's worse than that .PERIOD 
There are a lot of ideas to die for .PERIOD 
The secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA i think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses .PERIOD 
So let me just point out .PERIOD Memes are like viruses .PERIOD 
And you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how can that be .PERIOD 
They're made of information and can be carried in any physical medium .PERIOD 
Not just the priests .PERIOD Everybody .PERIOD 
After all the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .PERIOD 
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world ,COMMA thanks to our technology ,COMMA are a lot of toxic ideas .PERIOD 
And it's not our fault anymore than it's our fault .PERIOD When our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity .PERIOD 
We drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously .PERIOD My idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater .PERIOD Nor see it ever again .PERIOD 
I tell that story ,COMMA because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth .PERIOD 
It's thrilling .PERIOD 
First she talked about comfort status ,COMMA beauty .PERIOD 
And we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status -- that you care about your children .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
My job depends upon it .PERIOD 
Up to and around about the second world war .PERIOD Conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse ,COMMA not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals within it within an inch of their lives .PERIOD 
Let's be under no illusions .PERIOD 
Simply through singing .PERIOD 
So we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD We started touring them internationally .PERIOD 
One of them was carmen .PERIOD 
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive ,COMMA that there is nothing tiny about south african music making .PERIOD 
They don't read music .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD 
I've got a little experiment i want to try with you .PERIOD 
T :COLON see ,COMMA it's the same as f in music .PERIOD 
There i am like a bloody windmill .PERIOD Again .PERIOD You see .PERIOD 
The music will start and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that .PERIOD 
One more time with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD 
It's going to be britain's first ever national disabled orchestra .PERIOD 
Clarence i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .PERIOD 
I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today .PERIOD So you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are .PERIOD 
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point please ,COMMA let me know .PERIOD 
Haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD 
♫ like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the highlands ♫ ♫ like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in newfoundland ,COMMA ♫ ♫ there's a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ there's a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ i am blue .PERIOD ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ so i came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ and i dazzled ♫ ♫ in these dark streets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ like a diamond ♫ ♫ in a coalface ♫ ♫ then the cold wind ♫ ♫ from the islands ♫ ♫ blew a storm cloud ♫ ♫ across the new moon .PERIOD ♫ ♫ like the gun smoke ♫ ♫ above the houses ,COMMA ♫ ♫ in my home ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ well the subject of difficult .PERIOD Negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA camels .PERIOD 
Seventeen doesn't divide by two .PERIOD 
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time .PERIOD And finally she came back and said ,COMMA well i don't know if i can help you .PERIOD But at least if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel .PERIOD 
They had one camel left over .PERIOD 
Now if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations .PERIOD We get involved in .PERIOD 
As i've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four ,COMMA traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work ,COMMA getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet .PERIOD I've been asking myself that question .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do they deal with their differences .PERIOD 
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side .PERIOD And the third side of the conflict is us .PERIOD It's the surrounding community .PERIOD It's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members ,COMMA the neighbors .PERIOD 
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake .PERIOD 
And we met in the hague in the peace ,COMMA palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place .PERIOD 
And then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA you're an american .PERIOD 
Now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict ,COMMA but i think i've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step ,COMMA something that any one of us could do as third-siders .PERIOD 
And so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east ,COMMA but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD 
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it .PERIOD 
What would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK What is the story there .PERIOD 
Now as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story .PERIOD 
That :COLON man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was abraham .PERIOD 
What's the opposite of terrorism ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home in order to sow and create understanding ,COMMA or respect ,COMMA or love .PERIOD 
And that's what comes to the first step here .PERIOD 
That's the essence of the abraham path .PERIOD 
So what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people .PERIOD 
And just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an npr story on it .PERIOD 
And they quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world .PERIOD 
She's partially blind .PERIOD Her husband can't work .PERIOD She's got seven .PERIOD Kids .PERIOD 
And so more and more walkers have come ,COMMA and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD 
So my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in europe ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK In the middle east .PERIOD 
That's walking ,COMMA abraham's path .PERIOD 
After a tedtalk ,COMMA why not a tedwalk .PERIOD 
There's an old african proverb :COLON that goes when spider webs unite .PERIOD They can halt even the lion .PERIOD 
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt the lion of war .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack .PERIOD 
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery .PERIOD 
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know before they even have symptoms ,COMMA that they're having a heart attack to save their life .PERIOD 
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see ,COMMA in an emergency room .PERIOD And i'm going to show you why they don't work very well .PERIOD 
Next to it at <NUM> seconds ,COMMA you see this rise here ,COMMA then this rise -- that's the st elevation .PERIOD 
Then on friday at <NUM> ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around -- i'm not going to go into this early stage .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident .PERIOD But the heart muscle has died .PERIOD 
And now i want to talk about something entirely different .PERIOD 
So here's a picture of what we're doing .PERIOD 
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura ,COMMA by the way -- and i'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing ;SEMICOLON lights gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD 
Christina sidebottom ,COMMA well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like .PERIOD And it was very strange .PERIOD 
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times .PERIOD And the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura get treated and get diminished .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain ,COMMA which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there ,COMMA that it's going to happen .PERIOD And then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache .PERIOD 
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that i want to discuss here .PERIOD This afternoon .PERIOD 
We want to have some people who really know how to do this ,COMMA perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD 
And that is the second wish .PERIOD 
We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world .PERIOD 
And so there is a team of developers from all over africa who are part of this team now -- from ghana from malawi ,COMMA from kenya .PERIOD 
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you've got a lot of information that's great .PERIOD 
Take the crowd and apply them to the information .PERIOD 
And we are very happy to be part of the ted family .PERIOD 
It's inevitable terrible .PERIOD But really what i want to talk about is i'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .PERIOD 
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter .PERIOD 
If a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- john ;SEMICOLON it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love .PERIOD We actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do i plan to leave for my son .PERIOD 
I plan to publish my own notebook .PERIOD 
I have no idea how i'm going to do it .PERIOD But i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son .PERIOD 
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created ,COMMA that if you take some words from apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mix and burn .PERIOD 
And what that's done is it's created ,COMMA like i said ,COMMA a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD 
Imagine making it free ,COMMA so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology ,COMMA so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds .PERIOD Instead of years .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from unites states ,COMMA k-through-12 schools ,COMMA because anyone who's involved in a school scale back ?QUESTIONMARK The first thing that's cut is the music curriculum .PERIOD And so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content .PERIOD 
We've been working with amd which has a project called <NUM> by '<NUM> ,COMMA which is trying to bring internet connectivity to <NUM> percent of the world's population by <NUM> .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA burn ?QUESTIONMARK I think this is sort of quite interesting .PERIOD 
How much would it cost in a bookstore .PERIOD 
Why does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
Remember ,COMMA we took the book ,COMMA tore the pages out .PERIOD 
Imagine music xml that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA understand it .PERIOD 
Even the three wise men .PERIOD 
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD Anybody can contribute anything .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA thanks ,COMMA very much .PERIOD 
I've been at mit for <NUM> years ,COMMA i went to ted ,COMMA i .PERIOD 
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems they include education ,COMMA sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD 
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know ,COMMA seymour papert this is back in <NUM> when we were working in senegal .PERIOD 
Here we're in the '80s .PERIOD 
And these kids ,COMMA their first english word ,COMMA is google ,COMMA and they only know skype ,COMMA they've never heard of telephony .PERIOD 
Screw you go to the back of the line ,COMMA and someone else will do it .PERIOD And then when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD 
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down ,COMMA and that's why i said ,COMMA seven to <NUM> million there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project .PERIOD 
Because laptop economics are the following .PERIOD I say ,COMMA <NUM> percent here it's more like ,COMMA <NUM> <NUM> percent of the cost of your laptop ,COMMA is sales ,COMMA marketing ,COMMA distribution and profit .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA i've been using laptops since their inception .PERIOD 
The :COLON dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight .PERIOD 
And in about <NUM> days ,COMMA we'll know for sure whether this works .PERIOD 
Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance .PERIOD 
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with .PERIOD 
Everybody thinks they know about education .PERIOD A lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA guess what we're not .PERIOD 
Because there's no market for post office trucks .PERIOD 
You can spray paint it .PERIOD You can do anything you want .PERIOD 
That came from a <NUM> paper on space travel .PERIOD Because if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA here's a better way .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded .PERIOD 
These are the people that you have access to right now in general -- all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to .PERIOD 
But when you actually visualize it ,COMMA all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- it doesn't look technological .PERIOD 
It actually looks very organic .PERIOD 
It's that they're helping us to be more human ,COMMA helping us to connect with each other .PERIOD 
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography .PERIOD 
So that's why i study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD 
And people are initially reluctant to tell you .PERIOD 
We talk about things in relative terms .PERIOD 
And so when we look at these pmtct programs ,COMMA what does it mean .PERIOD 
Imagine yourself if you can .PERIOD You're a young woman in africa .PERIOD You're going to the hospital or clinic .PERIOD 
And you don't know who you can talk to .PERIOD Because the truth is ,COMMA hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out .PERIOD Without any means of support .PERIOD 
And this -- this is the face and story of hiv in africa today .PERIOD 
But we're here to talk about possible solutions ,COMMA and some good news .PERIOD 
Our organization ,COMMA mothers2mothers ,COMMA enlists women with hiv as care providers .PERIOD 
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone someone who's had the procedure .PERIOD 
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .PERIOD 
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .PERIOD 
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .PERIOD 
And if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes .PERIOD 
We have the medicines ,COMMA we have the tests .PERIOD But how do you reduce the stigma .PERIOD 
I've been afraid to tell everybody .PERIOD 
How do you build a better health care system ?QUESTIONMARK 
And our organization helps women across that bridge .PERIOD 
The program is now working in nine countries .PERIOD We have <NUM> program sites .PERIOD We're seeing about <NUM> women every month .PERIOD We're employing <NUM> ,COMMA mentor mothers and last year .PERIOD They enrolled <NUM> hiv-positive pregnant women ,COMMA and mothers .PERIOD 
All of this is possible .PERIOD If we each contribute to this fight .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Then they irradiate our food ,COMMA trying to make it last longer .PERIOD So it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD 
This man ,COMMA joel salatin .PERIOD They call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .PERIOD 
Since i'm home-schooled ,COMMA i went to go hear him speak one day .PERIOD 
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up .PERIOD 
Not too long ago ,COMMA my uncle said that .PERIOD He offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we had a harvard professor here -- she was from harvard ;SEMICOLON i just wanted to mention .PERIOD And -- and she was actually a professor from harvard .PERIOD 
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to <NUM> percent bible literally true .PERIOD 
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA it needs to be small .PERIOD 
Now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
Free bird .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA one ,COMMA more time -- i'm just going to give you a little help .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top .PERIOD 
Mr !EXCLAMATIONMARK Vice president .PERIOD I wish i knew how to quit you .PERIOD 
And sylvia earle .PERIOD And i were on an expedition in this submarine .PERIOD <NUM> years ago ,COMMA in japan .PERIOD 
But when i got there ,COMMA i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .PERIOD 
It's in the mid-pacific .PERIOD It's about five days from anywhere .PERIOD 
So that's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into .PERIOD 
It's a very deep-water part of our planet .PERIOD 
But we got up there ,COMMA and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD Where are we going to dive .PERIOD 
Let's try there ,COMMA and then falling into the water .PERIOD 
The phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries .PERIOD Especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here .PERIOD 
So i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end .PERIOD 
They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean .PERIOD 
And for some reason they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place ,COMMA and it took a while .PERIOD But finally they said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA you can come .PERIOD 
And i was free for dinner ,COMMA and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .PERIOD 
It had occurred on land in rainforests of south america and africa ,COMMA where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .PERIOD 
So we had very strong leadership ,COMMA very good vision .PERIOD And a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved .PERIOD 
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting .PERIOD But now it appeared to be dead ,COMMA at least in the coral areas .PERIOD 
And that's the story with climate-change heating .PERIOD 
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD 
And i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong in my stay there .PERIOD 
And i'll just give you one example .PERIOD I had gotten my first walkman .PERIOD 
Last november ,COMMA a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum ,COMMA in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor .PERIOD 
And for sure ,COMMA i haven't looked at the sky in the same way .PERIOD After spending an hour in there .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA one is just working without pressure .PERIOD 
This is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA related to it ,COMMA getting out of the studio .PERIOD 
Again .PERIOD We could supply the content for it .PERIOD 
Icons like batman ,COMMA superman wonder woman and their colleagues will be teaming up with icons .PERIOD Jabbar :COLON noora jami and their colleagues .PERIOD 
As christian iconography got changed ,COMMA and swastikas were created out of crucifixes .PERIOD Batman and superman were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada ,COMMA also going back to the bible .PERIOD 
Superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton .PERIOD But he's sent in a pod ,COMMA much like moses was on the nile .PERIOD 
So :COLON <NUM> of the stones are smuggled onto the nina ,COMMA the pinta and the santa maria and are spread in the new world .PERIOD 
To which he said ,COMMA let them be ,COMMA because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them .PERIOD 
So these <NUM> stones ,COMMA a few kind of rules in the game .PERIOD Number one :COLON you don't choose the stone .PERIOD The stone chooses .PERIOD You .PERIOD 
Well .PERIOD 
We have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power .PERIOD 
I'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful ,COMMA and the guys all strong .PERIOD 
That's not timely .PERIOD 
And that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures i have from south asia .PERIOD It was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school .PERIOD 
Opened a theme park through a license ,COMMA in kuwait a year ,COMMA and a half ago called the <NUM> village theme park -- <NUM> square feet .PERIOD <NUM> rides .PERIOD All with our characters .PERIOD A couple back-to-school licenses in spain ,COMMA and turkey .PERIOD

And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is .PERIOD But when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of the things that i refer to when i -- about the importance of this message -- is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university ,COMMA where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior .PERIOD And i gave the students two articles ,COMMA one from the new york times .PERIOD And one from new york magazine .PERIOD 
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
The second one took place in upstate new york .PERIOD 
She was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting .PERIOD

We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like .PERIOD 
This is mountains out of molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media .PERIOD Panic .PERIOD 
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it .PERIOD 
Let me show you this .PERIOD 
I'll take answers .PERIOD 
I wonder ,COMMA if i could make my life beautiful .PERIOD 
It's the language of the eye .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA china has an enormous population .PERIOD 
And if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior .PERIOD 
But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression .PERIOD 
So heart is filtered out .PERIOD So i can see if i'm curious about that .PERIOD 
So the data is now alive .PERIOD This is a living image ,COMMA and i can update it in a second .PERIOD 
It's even fun to engage with them ,COMMA because it's visual .PERIOD 
And that is beautiful .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
I will show it to you .PERIOD 
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green like cut grass .PERIOD 
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol ,COMMA and i had to learn chemistry on .PERIOD The fly in the last three years ,COMMA a very expensive high school chemistry education .PERIOD 
Now this is a totally insane idea .PERIOD 
And my definition of a theory is ,COMMA it’s not just something that you teach people .PERIOD It’s labor saving .PERIOD 
If it does you put the glass down ,COMMA you go to a different bar .PERIOD 
Now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology .PERIOD And he says ,COMMA that’s easy !EXCLAMATIONMARK The things are a different color .PERIOD

And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose ,COMMA you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA if something absorbs the energy ,COMMA the electron can travel .PERIOD 
What’s nice about this idea :COLON if you have a philosophical bent of mind ,COMMA is that then it tells you that the nose ,COMMA the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses .PERIOD 
He says to me ,COMMA i bet you cannot make a coumarin .PERIOD

But sometimes i try to put myself in that position .PERIOD 
But it's interesting to me .PERIOD I love to write historical verse .PERIOD 
I love to think what they thought ,COMMA what it was like .PERIOD 
We're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room .PERIOD 
And you stay up for <NUM> .PERIOD 
But always we scrabbled to lie with her first .PERIOD 
We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today .PERIOD 
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA if you go back in time ,COMMA it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time .PERIOD 
And i imagined him to be tall ,COMMA dark-skinned .PERIOD 
We began to find limb bones .PERIOD We found finger bones .PERIOD The bones of the pelvis :COLON vertebrae ,COMMA ribs ,COMMA the collar bones ;SEMICOLON things that had never ever been seen before in homo erectus .PERIOD 
But also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia ,COMMA where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated ,COMMA and have become dwarfed .PERIOD And they're only about a meter in height .PERIOD 
And what is it that really makes us us .PERIOD 
I think it's our collective intelligence .PERIOD 
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder -- it's a repository for my brain ,COMMA everything that i could possibly be interested in .PERIOD 
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand .PERIOD I made some measurements of her thumb ,COMMA and i scaled them out to the size of the skull .PERIOD 
Built out of words ,COMMA it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk .PERIOD And this represents the falcon in the movie .PERIOD 
And so now it was time to do some research .PERIOD 
What do they do ?QUESTIONMARK How do you start something like that ?QUESTIONMARK I really don't know .PERIOD 
And i'm following all the light kicks on this thing ,COMMA and making sure that as i'm holding the light in the same position ,COMMA i'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail .PERIOD I'm going into this thing .PERIOD 
This thing was made of resin ,COMMA and it was too light .PERIOD 
That's half the weight of my dog ,COMMA huxley .PERIOD 
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica i bought on ebay .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK I figure i have two options .PERIOD 
One i can fire a freaking laser at it ,COMMA which i have already done to do a 3d scan -- there's a 3d scan of this falcon .PERIOD 
But really ,COMMA if we're all going to be honest with ourselves ,COMMA i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never .PERIOD The point of the exercise to begin with .PERIOD Was it .PERIOD 
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
If i go out in the open ocean environment ,COMMA virtually anywhere in the world ,COMMA and i drag a net from <NUM> feet to the surface ,COMMA most of the animals -- in fact ,COMMA in many places ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> percent of the animals that i bring up in that net -- make light .PERIOD 
So you turn on the camera ,COMMA turn out the lights .PERIOD 
I knew my forward speed ,COMMA i knew the area .PERIOD And so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter .PERIOD 
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .PERIOD 
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure .PERIOD 
So she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey .PERIOD 
So now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world .PERIOD Because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this is a deep-sea version of women's lib .PERIOD 
She always knows where he is ,COMMA and she doesn't have to be monogamous .PERIOD Because some of these females come up with multiple males attached .PERIOD 
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive .PERIOD 
This is an unbelievable light show .PERIOD 
So i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore .PERIOD 
That's me on the left ,COMMA my graduate student at the time ,COMMA erika raymond ,COMMA and lee fry ,COMMA who was the engineer on the project .PERIOD 
We're at the edge of the brine pool .PERIOD There's a fish that's swimming towards the camera .PERIOD

It's like 21st-century henry moore ,COMMA when you see a henry moore ,COMMA still your hair stands up .PERIOD There's some amazing spiritual connect .PERIOD 
We need to be in that realm .PERIOD I want to do stuff like that .PERIOD 
This is two weeks ago in ccp ,COMMA in coventry ,COMMA who build parts for bentleys .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
This is what goes on .PERIOD In my studio everyday ,COMMA i walk -- i'm traveling .PERIOD I come back .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA you get into biopolymers .PERIOD They looked straight through me .PERIOD 
I've had this image of a water droplet for <NUM> years ,COMMA sitting on a hot bed .PERIOD

I'm not putting charles eames' furniture in buildings anymore .PERIOD 
Who cares .PERIOD 
This is called a plasnet .PERIOD 
These are my sculptures .PERIOD 
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .PERIOD 
And in the course of that ,COMMA i studied ,COMMA i met with medical doctors ,COMMA scientists .PERIOD And i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive ,COMMA more inspired ,COMMA more joyful life is getting enough sleep .PERIOD 
And our guide was a local science teacher .PERIOD 
At the end of this day ,COMMA i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this .PERIOD One teacher .PERIOD 
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem ,COMMA and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference .PERIOD 
The trial ,COMMA lawyers ,COMMA say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this legal fear ,COMMA makes doctors ,COMMA practice ,COMMA better medicine .PERIOD 
The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur ,COMMA because doctors are afraid to speak up .PERIOD Are you sure that's the right dosage ?QUESTIONMARK 
It goes on .PERIOD We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york .PERIOD The board of ed had no idea .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's just absolutely a formula for failure .PERIOD 
And why not they don't trust the law ,COMMA why don't they trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA how do you fix it ?QUESTIONMARK We could spend <NUM> lifetimes .PERIOD Trying to prune this legal jungle .PERIOD 
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties ,COMMA because it carries with it the power of state .PERIOD 
If you make people self-conscious about their judgments ,COMMA studies show you will make them ,COMMA make worse judgments .PERIOD 
Edison stated it best .PERIOD He said ,COMMA hell ,COMMA we ain't got no rules around here .PERIOD We're trying to accomplish something .PERIOD 
All these choices :COLON involve value judgments and social norms .PERIOD Not objective facts .PERIOD 
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator .PERIOD 
So what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy .PERIOD 
Law is a human institution .PERIOD Responsibility is a human institution .PERIOD 
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims ,COMMA then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders .PERIOD 
What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .PERIOD 
The second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher .PERIOD 
We certainly can't trust the bankers ,COMMA and we certainly can't trust the brokers .PERIOD 
And even as we do our own work ,COMMA all too often ,COMMA we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing ,COMMA and doing the expected thing ,COMMA or the required thing or the profitable thing .PERIOD 
Or if they do have our interests at heart ,COMMA we worry that they don't know us ,COMMA well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests .PERIOD 
In addition ,COMMA we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies ,COMMA rather than securing short-term profits .PERIOD 
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is that .PERIOD 
A wise person knows when to bend the rules .PERIOD 
A wise person knows when to improvise .PERIOD 
And most important ,COMMA a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims .PERIOD 
He was supporting his wife and a child .PERIOD And the child was going to parochial school .PERIOD 
Then he lost his job .PERIOD 
The judge on the case judge lois forer thought that this made no sense .PERIOD 
He did he served out his sentence .PERIOD 
For ms .PERIOD Dewey .PERIOD This isn't why she became a teacher .PERIOD 
In the veterans' court -- this was the first of its kind in the united states .PERIOD 
Why has the idea spread .PERIOD 
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record .PERIOD 
So here's is a system-changer ,COMMA and it seems to be catching .PERIOD 
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness .PERIOD And he was right .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA we argue ,COMMA there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD 
First of all we started off the nuclear age in <NUM> .PERIOD 
We had a few nuclear weapons ,COMMA two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima ,COMMA a few days later in nagasaki in august <NUM> ,COMMA killing about <NUM> people between those two .PERIOD 
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities .PERIOD 
We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD 
This disconnect was never actually resolved .PERIOD 
So what is a nuclear terror ?QUESTIONMARK Threat .PERIOD 
There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it .PERIOD 
Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference .PERIOD Since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us ,COMMA it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured ,COMMA destruction would not work .PERIOD 
You take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it .PERIOD 
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability .PERIOD But what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .PERIOD 
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time ,COMMA soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table .PERIOD 
There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth .PERIOD Many many times over .PERIOD 
We're coming down ,COMMA and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here .PERIOD In the financial district .PERIOD 
This is a 10-kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima .PERIOD And i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD I think -- news :COLON you could use kind of concept here .PERIOD 
And if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away .PERIOD 
And if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA i wasn't <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
I wasn't really a rocket scientist .PERIOD But i was working at the jet propulsion ,COMMA laboratory in sunny california ,COMMA where it's warm ,COMMA whereas now i'm in the mid-west ,COMMA and it's cold .PERIOD 
And he told me biosignatures .PERIOD We need to look for a biosignature .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life .PERIOD 
But immediately the system goes like ,COMMA what kind of dumb piece of code was this .PERIOD 
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types .PERIOD 
As long as i know that there's some sort of alphabet .PERIOD 
And obviously ,COMMA each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent .PERIOD 
And if i look at french texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different or italian ,COMMA or german .PERIOD 
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem or whether it's a mathematical text .PERIOD 
The avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .PERIOD 
Too hot ,COMMA too hot .PERIOD 
And i'm just showing this to you again because it's so nice .PERIOD 
One of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to earth .PERIOD But that in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere .PERIOD 
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players .PERIOD 
What i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .PERIOD 
Political :COLON economic .PERIOD Psychological .PERIOD Whatever .PERIOD 
Don't ask .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i turned him down .PERIOD 
That's not a cause .PERIOD That's an emergency .PERIOD 
And what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .PERIOD 
That's right .PERIOD 
We like to give ,COMMA and we give a lot .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA africa makes a fool of our idea of justice .PERIOD 
Africa is a continent in flames .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room .PERIOD 
There's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real .PERIOD 
Our credibility .PERIOD 
I can't ,COMMA you can't as individuals ,COMMA but we can change the world .PERIOD 
But working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world .PERIOD 
Ideas that you gestated in your youth .PERIOD 
Well now actually because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world .PERIOD 
So why then are we not pumping our fists into the air .PERIOD 
But for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology .PERIOD We have the know-how ;SEMICOLON we have the cash .PERIOD We have the life-saving drugs .PERIOD 
The clash ?QUESTIONMARK Wore big ?QUESTIONMARK Army boots ,COMMA not sandals .PERIOD 
But some of them they haven't .PERIOD 
Not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill ,COMMA stability and security that we'll gain .PERIOD 
What i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts ,COMMA that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa by america and by the world .PERIOD 
Give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing .PERIOD 
The war against terror ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
Actually we're talking to abc today about the oscars .PERIOD 
We need to get the math .PERIOD We need to get the statistics out to the american people .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA by one they step forward ,COMMA a nurse ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a homemaker ,COMMA and lives are saved .PERIOD 
We can make history .PERIOD 
We can start to make poverty history .PERIOD 
The idea that the internet ,COMMA which changed all of our lives ,COMMA can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog ,COMMA let alone digital -- blows my mind .PERIOD 
Communication is very important for ethiopia -- will transform the country .PERIOD 
I am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than elvis presley .PERIOD 
And love is not love ,COMMA but being all shook up .PERIOD 
Does that correspond ?QUESTIONMARK 
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia ,COMMA in which we understand one concept in the context of another .PERIOD 
One of the sentences was ,COMMA some jobs are jails .PERIOD 
And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing .PERIOD Pursuing a goal .PERIOD 
But there is a better translation .PERIOD 
The latin word ,COMMA cogito is derived from the prefix co ,COMMA meaning together ,COMMA and the verb agitare ,COMMA meaning to shake .PERIOD 
And in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor .PERIOD 
We want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction ,COMMA like in life .PERIOD 
And as long as we fight horizontally against life ,COMMA against the winds ,COMMA against what's happening to us ,COMMA life is a nightmare .PERIOD 
How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day .PERIOD 
It's not true .PERIOD 
This is very practical .PERIOD 
This is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD 
But we were expected to have doubts .PERIOD We're expected to have fears .PERIOD 
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles .PERIOD 
We landed with <NUM> kilos .PERIOD 
I had no idea how it was possible .PERIOD 
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh ,COMMA with apollo <NUM> with the wright brothers' flyer with chuck yeager's <NUM> ,COMMA i had really a thought then .PERIOD 
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now .PERIOD 
Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it .PERIOD 
The goal is to take off end of this year for the first test ,COMMA but mainly next year ,COMMA spring or summer ,COMMA take off on our own power ,COMMA without additional help ,COMMA without being towed ,COMMA climb to <NUM> meters altitude .PERIOD 
So you see that this airplane is more a symbol .PERIOD 
I don't think it will transport <NUM> people in the next years .PERIOD 
And <NUM> years later ,COMMA there were <NUM> people in every airplane crossing the atlantic .PERIOD 
And each time we have some ice in the future ,COMMA we have to know that life will be great .PERIOD And the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice ,COMMA to go through the obstacle to go through the problem .PERIOD In order to see what there is on the other side .PERIOD 
I wish i could show you my yemen .PERIOD 
It was very hard ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to impose my authority .PERIOD 
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do .PERIOD 
It's about proving who you are ,COMMA and what you can do .PERIOD 
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society .PERIOD And the one that you are now creating at the paper .PERIOD 
And this is true .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the yemen times across <NUM> years has been through so much .PERIOD 
They think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper .PERIOD 
And very ,COMMA very difficult times .PERIOD 
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .PERIOD 
That thing .PERIOD 
I'm not so old .PERIOD 
Actually that's a documentary that's available online .PERIOD The video's online .PERIOD 
And certainly you yourself ,COMMA and what you do have ,COMMA given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for .PERIOD 
On twitter ,COMMA also .PERIOD 
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics .PERIOD With this issue .PERIOD 
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater :COLON drinking water ,COMMA rain water .PERIOD 
In some cases ,COMMA another species like the north american leopard frog ,COMMA showed that males exposed to atrazine ,COMMA grew eggs in their testes .PERIOD 
Normally the testes should make testosterone .PERIOD The male hormone .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole ,COMMA which blocks aromatase ,COMMA blocks estrogen ,COMMA so that if you developed a mutated cell ,COMMA it doesn't grow into a tumor .PERIOD 
Pjc :COLON so speaking of estrogen ,COMMA one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a ,COMMA bpa ,COMMA which has been in the news recently .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns ,COMMA our infants ,COMMA with a synthetic estrogen .PERIOD 
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to .PERIOD 
And given the life of many of these chemicals ,COMMA generations ,COMMA years ,COMMA dozens of years .PERIOD That means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren by things that we're putting into the environment today .PERIOD 
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago .PERIOD When i found out i was pregnant ,COMMA and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed no heartbeat .PERIOD 
We know so much about global warming and climate change ,COMMA and yet we have no concept of what i've been calling internal environmentalism .PERIOD 
I'm not married .PERIOD But one year ago today ,COMMA i woke up from a month-long coma ,COMMA following a double lung transplant .PERIOD

Doctors insert a catheter into your chest ,COMMA which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds .PERIOD

Against my doctors' and family's wishes ,COMMA i needed to go back for the funeral .PERIOD 
I was dying ,COMMA and if i didn't mix that stuff up fast ,COMMA i would never leave that apartment alive .PERIOD 
I went back to the states ,COMMA anticipating ,COMMA i'd return to europe .PERIOD But the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital .PERIOD 
A happy .PERIOD Patient is a healthy patient .PERIOD 
And it was right-heart failure .PERIOD 
It was a match .PERIOD 
Because despite their problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs .PERIOD And i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up .PERIOD 
They left my chest open for two weeks .PERIOD 
An infection ravaged .PERIOD My skin .PERIOD

I became very interested ,COMMA and i wrote about a couple .PERIOD 
His friend ,COMMA a guy named marwood harris ,COMMA was following behind .PERIOD

Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees .PERIOD 
That's my son oliver .PERIOD 
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny ,COMMA then children are somewhat closer to our roots .PERIOD As primates in the arboreal forest .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA ascend .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD Stories .PERIOD 
And there's also something that i want to show you .PERIOD 
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees .PERIOD 
We're looking at the very top of gaya ,COMMA which is thought to be the oldest redwood .PERIOD 
What can the redwoods tell us about ourselves .PERIOD 
The flickering ,COMMA transitory quality of human time ,COMMA and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love .PERIOD 
And i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children ,COMMA i've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans ,COMMA who are lucky enough ,COMMA or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees .PERIOD 
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide ,COMMA all through the ecosystems .PERIOD And you know ,COMMA the earth itself -- ca :COLON partly ,COMMA caused by us ,COMMA inadvertently .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
We know because it says so inside the code .PERIOD 
And basit and amjad are first names .PERIOD Pakistani first names .PERIOD 
So half a year ago ,COMMA i decided to go to pakistan myself .PERIOD 
And i knocked on the door .PERIOD 
You want to guess who opened the door .PERIOD 
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .PERIOD 
Let me show you one ,COMMA which actually makes some sound .PERIOD 
We find guys like bjorn sundin originally from sweden and his partner in crime ,COMMA also listed on the interpol wanted pages mr .PERIOD Shaileshkumar :COLON jain a us .PERIOD Citizen .PERIOD 
Now criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before ,COMMA can reach us .PERIOD 
But even more interestingly ,COMMA if we continue decrypting ,COMMA we'll find this mysterious string ,COMMA which says o600ko78rus .PERIOD 
It's not used for anything .PERIOD 
I got zero hits .PERIOD Wasn't there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i spoke with the guys at the lab .PERIOD 
And on this blog ,COMMA he blogs about his life about his life in st .PERIOD Petersburg -- he's in his early 20s -- about his cat about his girlfriend .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this guy drives a mercedes-benz .PERIOD S600 :COLON v12 :COLON with a six-liter engine with more than <NUM> horsepower .PERIOD 
The vast majority of the online crime cases we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from .PERIOD 
Plc's these small boxes which have no display ,COMMA no keyboard ,COMMA which are programmed are put in place .PERIOD And they do their job .PERIOD 
You go to any factory any power plant ,COMMA any chemical plant ,COMMA any food processing plant ,COMMA you look around -- everything is being run by computers .PERIOD 
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime .PERIOD 
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators .PERIOD 
I don't have a clue .PERIOD 
Mother theresa .PERIOD She was rational .PERIOD 
So we have to work out who influences problems .PERIOD 
There are lots of people shaping decisions .PERIOD And so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome .PERIOD Not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA with just that little bit of input ,COMMA we can work out what the choices are that people have ,COMMA what the chances are ,COMMA that they're willing to take what they're after ,COMMA what they value ,COMMA what they want ,COMMA and what they believe about other people .PERIOD 
I remind you of that <NUM> percent accuracy rate .PERIOD 
What's its future .PERIOD 
Over here you can see .PERIOD This is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today .PERIOD This is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of <NUM> ,COMMA early parts of <NUM> .PERIOD 
That power disappears completely .PERIOD Nobody supports that by <NUM> .PERIOD 
Here is mr .PERIOD Ahmadinejad .PERIOD 
He is ,COMMA on the way down .PERIOD 
Everything is not predictable .PERIOD The stock market is at least for me not predictable .PERIOD But most complicated negotiations are predictable .PERIOD 
And if you engineer what they do ,COMMA you can change the world ,COMMA you can get a better result .PERIOD 
So i've had an obsession basically for <NUM> years ,COMMA and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives .PERIOD 
Whether it be your business ,COMMA your contribution to society ,COMMA money -- whatever it is for you -- your body ,COMMA your family .PERIOD 
But the other lesson of life that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment .PERIOD 
Because science is easy right .PERIOD 
And everybody in this room -- you wouldn't be in this room .PERIOD If you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society thinks biography is destiny .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON aye .PERIOD 
Al ?QUESTIONMARK Gore :COLON supreme court .PERIOD 
If you don't have the money ,COMMA but you're creative and determined enough ,COMMA you find the way .PERIOD So this is the ultimate resource .PERIOD 
In this second ,COMMA consciously or unconsciously ,COMMA the minute you decide to focus on something you've got to give it a meaning ,COMMA and whatever that meaning is produces emotion .PERIOD 
Honestly ,COMMA better or worse ,COMMA say ,COMMA aye .PERIOD 
How would their lives be different ,COMMA their impact .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON aye .PERIOD 
Let me tell you what they are .PERIOD First one certainty .PERIOD 
So that's why violence has always been around ,COMMA and will be around ,COMMA unless we have a consciousness change as a species .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA focus on :COLON 'there's food' -- what a concept ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
Second -- but this is what changed my life .PERIOD This is what shaped me as a human being -- somebody's gift .PERIOD 
<NUM> seconds ,COMMA that's all i want to be respectful .PERIOD <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes ,COMMA you might dismiss them as poor and simple .PERIOD 
We will not be there .PERIOD 
Mau is a palu ,COMMA a navigator priest .PERIOD 
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific ,COMMA without the use of instruments .PERIOD 
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance .PERIOD 
Their achievements ,COMMA intellectually and scientifically ,COMMA are extraordinary ,COMMA and they are so relevant for these times that we are in .PERIOD When we are riding out storms .PERIOD 
We cannot afford to lose it .PERIOD 
The link between the past and the future is fragile .PERIOD 
I am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds .PERIOD And the rains .PERIOD 
And i am reminded that throughout the world ,COMMA there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them ,COMMA as potent as the micronesian navigators ,COMMA that are going dismissed .PERIOD That this is a testament to brilliant ,COMMA brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly .PERIOD 
Youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners .PERIOD But in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies ,COMMA mashups and more ,COMMA we need to first identify .PERIOD When copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .PERIOD 
Because sony music had registered ,COMMA chris brown's video in our content id system within seconds of attempting to upload the video ,COMMA the copy was detected ,COMMA giving sony the choice of what to do next .PERIOD 
The video's inspired over <NUM> dollars in donations to end domestic violence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why has no one ever solved this problem before .PERIOD 
But it's not just about dollars and impressions .PERIOD 
♫ billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ strange fruit for .PERIOD ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of carnegie hall .PERIOD ♫ ♫ famous jazz singer gone awol ,COMMA ♫ ♫ must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ on a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ she was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫ ♫ but love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ by daybreak she's gone .PERIOD ♫ ♫ over the frozen river home ♫ ♫ me and johnny walker ♫ ♫ see in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ billie time ,COMMA ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ still an echo .PERIOD ♫ ♫ in my heart says ,COMMA ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫ so i really consider myself a storyteller .PERIOD 
Since the dawn of human history ,COMMA we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art ,COMMA writing poems ,COMMA singing songs ,COMMA scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper ,COMMA gossiping with friends .PERIOD This is nothing new .PERIOD 
It's been running for about a year and a half .PERIOD 
And i'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized .PERIOD So this is we feel fine .PERIOD 
The dots exhibit human qualities ,COMMA they kind of have their own physics ,COMMA and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life .PERIOD 
And then they also exhibit curiosity .PERIOD 
There's also murmurs montage ,COMMA mobs metrics and mounds .PERIOD 
And then one by one ,COMMA in reverse chronological order .PERIOD They excuse themselves ,COMMA entering the scrolling list of feelings .PERIOD 
I feel invisible to you .PERIOD 
I feel in love with carolyn .PERIOD I feel so naughty .PERIOD 
This is in response to what's beautiful miss world .PERIOD 
And it caused me to wonder about our world today .PERIOD 
And those are the questions that inspired my new project ,COMMA which is debuting here today at ted .PERIOD 
It's called universe ,COMMA revealing our modern mythology .PERIOD 
This is the universe of <NUM> ,COMMA the last two months .PERIOD 
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe .PERIOD 
So we see obama .PERIOD And the clintons meet in alabama .PERIOD 
You can see that this is an important story .PERIOD There are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD If we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story .PERIOD 
And you'll all be able to use it ,COMMA and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be .PERIOD 
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like .PERIOD 
We're facing this problem .PERIOD 
There is the problem .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA going back maybe <NUM> years in time ,COMMA when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .PERIOD 
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything .PERIOD 
This is a data set .PERIOD That was captured using a ct scanner .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA all the data is inside ,COMMA so i can start rotating .PERIOD I can look at it from different angles ,COMMA and i can see that this woman had a problem .PERIOD 
And one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD 
So this is from a virtual autopsy .PERIOD 
The person was killed by stabs in the heart .PERIOD But they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD 
Here's another case that i think is interesting .PERIOD 
During a physical autopsy .PERIOD If you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do .PERIOD 
So if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out .PERIOD 
It's really a hands-on experience .PERIOD 
And this is a bit of science fiction now ,COMMA so we're moving into really the future .PERIOD 
And he's also hearing our instructions ,COMMA when we tell him to do things .PERIOD 
And in just a second here ,COMMA you will see -- okay ,COMMA here motts .PERIOD Now move your left ,COMMA foot .PERIOD 
I can look inside of it .PERIOD 
And here it is ,COMMA here is the nose of the bear .PERIOD 
Well :COLON <NUM> percent of the men in lesotho worked in the mines :COLON over the border .PERIOD In brutal conditions .PERIOD 
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village .PERIOD 
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang ,COMMA and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD 
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this ,COMMA but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .PERIOD 
And there've been bangs in the past ,COMMA and there will be bangs in the future .PERIOD 
What about africa .PERIOD 
It's still going on .PERIOD 
What about africa's capacity to do something about these problems .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in africa .PERIOD 
And while i was busy working -- i was working on these colliding worlds ,COMMA in the day .PERIOD 
And we got lots of applicants .PERIOD 
You have to rethink what is the university for .PERIOD 
No droning on at the chalkboard .PERIOD 
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at <NUM> am .PERIOD 
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa's development .PERIOD Because in those areas ,COMMA scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage .PERIOD 
They'll publish be invited to conferences .PERIOD 
And aims has done extremely well .PERIOD 
Five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the us or europe .PERIOD 
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD 
Here are the current students at aims .PERIOD There are <NUM> of them from <NUM> different countries ,COMMA including <NUM> women .PERIOD 
So now i'm going to get to my ted business .PERIOD 
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD 
And she's now at aims .PERIOD 
And our wish has two parts :COLON one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african .PERIOD 
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD 
Over the last year we've been visiting sites in africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new aims centers .PERIOD 
So we have political support right across the continent .PERIOD 
But nobody was really worried about this .PERIOD 
This is a quote actually from alan turing in <NUM> years ,COMMA it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person .PERIOD 
This was in <NUM> .PERIOD And now in <NUM> .PERIOD It's still not true .PERIOD 
That's how much power this computer uses .PERIOD 
Rory is a graduate .PERIOD Student at stanford .PERIOD 
I estimate <NUM> to the <NUM> bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does .PERIOD 
And let me just summarize .PERIOD So the bottom line the brain processes information using <NUM> times less energy than we do right now ,COMMA with this computer technology that we have .PERIOD 
So this clip is from the pbs series ,COMMA the secret life of the brain .PERIOD 
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now ,COMMA as you're watching this .PERIOD 
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor .PERIOD 
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one ,COMMA and the absence of current to represent a zero .PERIOD 
But when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current .PERIOD 
In fact there's about <NUM> .PERIOD Electrons can all be flowing this way .PERIOD 
What you see here is that there's ,COMMA these redundant connections .PERIOD 
This is kareem's :COLON dark eyes .PERIOD And that's the white background that you see here .PERIOD 
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve .PERIOD 
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .PERIOD 
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .PERIOD 
But today ,COMMA the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why is it so important ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD 
It depends only on the mass of the object .PERIOD 
There are big ones .PERIOD There are little ones .PERIOD 
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy .PERIOD Just to give you a sense of scale .PERIOD 
So at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from .PERIOD 
So you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light .PERIOD We see .PERIOD 
And if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet .PERIOD 
And we live in the middle of it .PERIOD So when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA or line that defines the plane of the galaxy .PERIOD 
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA because remember ,COMMA my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume .PERIOD 
So i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible .PERIOD 
Because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible .PERIOD 
And that buys us about a factor of <NUM> .PERIOD 
So without this technology ,COMMA you can't see the stars .PERIOD 
And this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime .PERIOD 
And the truth is ,COMMA i'm not quite there .PERIOD 
But we actually have no alternative today ,COMMA to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD 
Likewise ,COMMA for the young stars .PERIOD Or ,COMMA in contrast ,COMMA the young stars .PERIOD They just should not be there .PERIOD 
Using observations that are not the ones i've shown you today .PERIOD We can actually figure out which ones are old ,COMMA and which ones are young .PERIOD 
The old ones are red .PERIOD 
He didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired .PERIOD 
And the thing about classical music ,COMMA that what and how it's inexhaustible .PERIOD 
And a tough ,COMMA slouchy kid got up to bat .PERIOD And he took a swing and really connected .PERIOD 
Brah dada dadadadah .PERIOD 
And whether we call them <NUM> per second ,COMMA a or <NUM> b ,COMMA flat -- trust me .PERIOD That's right -- they're just phenomena .PERIOD 
And in the 17th century ,COMMA it was more like this .PERIOD 
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation ,COMMA and the art of composition .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in the first eight centuries ,COMMA or so of this tradition the big 'what' was to praise god .PERIOD 
The 'how' was a style called polyphony ,COMMA music of many independently moving voices .PERIOD That suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD 
Ah !EXCLAMATIONMARK Avaricious !EXCLAMATIONMARK Heaven .PERIOD 
And the chords ,COMMA it turned out ,COMMA were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .PERIOD 
It's just these two notes in the middle .PERIOD 
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality .PERIOD 
What happens when the music stops .PERIOD 
Where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK What's left .PERIOD 
It's the passing on part .PERIOD It's the 'why' part of it .PERIOD 
At the same time ,COMMA technology by taking over the role that notation had always played ,COMMA shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .PERIOD 
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music .PERIOD 
Nobody knows .PERIOD 
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers -- to be explorers together .PERIOD 
You can start anywhere ramble a bit .PERIOD 
Then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys .PERIOD 
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this .PERIOD Either .PERIOD 
If you'd loan me your gulfstream ,COMMA i'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .PERIOD 
The story starts with just a single person :COLON a child ,COMMA behaving a little strangely .PERIOD 
They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges .PERIOD 
It's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here's an example -- pre-internet -- of this machine in action .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam ,COMMA but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .PERIOD 
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness because it works for us .PERIOD Each time .PERIOD 
By giving away our tedx brand .PERIOD We suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas .PERIOD 
We're a social species .PERIOD 
And that's why what i'm excited about ,COMMA and what i think is under-reported ,COMMA is the significance of the rise of online video .PERIOD 
He's a unicyclist .PERIOD 
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on video .PERIOD 
Why do people like watching tedtalks ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .PERIOD 
I mean today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and ,COMMA in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh .PERIOD 
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn ,COMMA and ,COMMA crucially ,COMMA to respond ,COMMA completing the cycle .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us what the next stage of ted's evolution has to be .PERIOD 
They used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
The name abegg -- abegg is actually a-b-e-g-g .PERIOD And that's the main theme in the melody .PERIOD 
What i do first is i make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and i choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the abegg that you just heard .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for inspiration ,COMMA i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers .PERIOD 
And once i realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing ,COMMA it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw .PERIOD Or if you want to draw an original character .PERIOD 
Like am i going to use one page .PERIOD 
Am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect ?QUESTIONMARK I guess .PERIOD 
Instead i'd like to try something called improvisation .PERIOD 
And that's a huge amount of data .PERIOD 
And the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture ,COMMA materials and strangely enough ,COMMA men .PERIOD Those are not good topics to talk about .PERIOD 
Ingenious tedtalks :COLON much more this green color ,COMMA etc .PERIOD Et .PERIOD 
Now since this is tedactive ,COMMA and i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something ,COMMA i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you ,COMMA but rather give you a tool to create your own .PERIOD 
And i call this tool ,COMMA the tedpad .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Now if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics .PERIOD Some of which we were just hearing about again ,COMMA i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being in happiness ,COMMA in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i can't ,COMMA in the time i've got give huge numbers of examples ,COMMA but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change .PERIOD 
And this is so obvious ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop the way we travel ,COMMA the way that business is done .PERIOD 
We want to get people to be more energy ,COMMA efficient .PERIOD 
Obviously here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA ask not what your country can do for .PERIOD You ask what you can do for your country .PERIOD An incredibly noble sentiment .PERIOD 
But when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger better society .PERIOD 
And i think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which i'm going to read a big chunk of ,COMMA which sums up what i said at the beginning ,COMMA about believing there is more to life than money and more that we should try and measure than money .PERIOD 
Some say up to five tons .PERIOD 
They're fantastic creatures .PERIOD 
So they were incredibly important animals .PERIOD 
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized ,COMMA through the language .PERIOD 
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface .PERIOD 
And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface .PERIOD 
And we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech ,COMMA with a big long pole .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA sharks fish are underwater .PERIOD Most of the time .PERIOD 
And here's a couple of maps that we've done .PERIOD 
That one ,COMMA you can see that we tagged both off kerry .PERIOD 
So he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time consuming .PERIOD And to his surprise ,COMMA came up with almost identical results .PERIOD 
And it's thought ,COMMA maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be <NUM> years ago .PERIOD And this has caused a very low diversity .PERIOD 
But the average of all ,COMMA these studies came out -- the mean is about <NUM> ,COMMA which i personally don't believe ,COMMA but then i am a skeptic .PERIOD 
In fact of those <NUM> <NUM> were thought to be females .PERIOD 
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .PERIOD 
And some are caught in nets ,COMMA in trawls .PERIOD 
And in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples ,COMMA five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system .PERIOD 
And i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .PERIOD 
And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .PERIOD 
And you just want to learn as much as you can .PERIOD As soon as you can .PERIOD 
Philosophers ,COMMA dramatists theologians have grappled with this question for centuries :COLON what makes people go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
So when i read robert louis stevenson ,COMMA that wasn't fiction .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA he disobeyed god .PERIOD And that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD 
I became an expert witness for one of the guards sergeant chip frederick ;SEMICOLON and in that position ,COMMA i had access to the dozen investigative reports .PERIOD 
I had access to him .PERIOD I could study him .PERIOD Have him come to my home ,COMMA get to know him .PERIOD Do psychological analysis to see .PERIOD Was he a good apple or bad apple .PERIOD 
Why tier 1-a was the center for military intelligence ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's one of the visual illustrations of evil .PERIOD 
Who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA that's a bad question .PERIOD 
And so we're interested in ,COMMA what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel .PERIOD 
And social scientists stop there ,COMMA and they miss .PERIOD The big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib .PERIOD 
This is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx .PERIOD And he asked the question could the holocaust happen here .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room .PERIOD 
And so he's the modern lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of god ,COMMA who becomes the angel of death .PERIOD 
It was a real cop car ,COMMA it was a real policeman .PERIOD And there were real neighbors in the street who didn't know that .PERIOD This was an experiment .PERIOD 
Do they kill torture ,COMMA mutilate ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
If you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD They knew that and let that happen .PERIOD 
The answer is nobody .PERIOD And i think ,COMMA nobody on purpose .PERIOD 
Banality of heroism is .PERIOD It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds .PERIOD 
He was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it was he a hero .PERIOD No .PERIOD 
She came down ,COMMA saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK It's terrible ,COMMA what you're doing to those boys .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses ,COMMA that i'm working with matt langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination ,COMMA this self-labeling ,COMMA i am a hero in waiting ,COMMA and teach them skills .PERIOD 
Wesley and the guy -- <NUM> and a half inches height .PERIOD 
A half an inch would have taken his head off .PERIOD 
Take path one .PERIOD You're going to be a perpetrator of evil .PERIOD 
Path two .PERIOD You become guilty of the evil of passive inaction .PERIOD 
We should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity .PERIOD We would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world .PERIOD 
So much for the wonder ,COMMA now for the mystery .PERIOD 
And in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain .PERIOD 
You have the green ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information ,COMMA or the blue that corresponds to auditory information .PERIOD 
But what about the self .PERIOD 
And for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA how can you have this reference point ,COMMA this stability ,COMMA that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day .PERIOD 
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day .PERIOD 
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord .PERIOD 
It developed in collectives of human beings .PERIOD 
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex ,COMMA and how this is made .PERIOD 
And if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth ,COMMA why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK 
When i was just a little girl ,COMMA my mom started ,COMMA what is now ?QUESTIONMARK The longest-running women's film festival in the world .PERIOD 
Fishnet stockings .PERIOD 
I thought they were really hot .PERIOD 
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness .PERIOD 
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who ,COMMA say ,COMMA i ,COMMA googled jessica simpson ,COMMA and stumbled on your site .PERIOD 
We don't want one face .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .PERIOD 
Which brings me to my third paradox .PERIOD 
You may have guessed by now i did not light myself on fire .PERIOD 
Cornel west says ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it's a failure .PERIOD 
She was talking about board meetings .PERIOD She was founding peace organizations .PERIOD She was coordinating carpools ,COMMA she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD 
And surely at three and four years old ,COMMA i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice .PERIOD But i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work .PERIOD 
Know thyself .PERIOD 
And we feel like we have to get far ,COMMA far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD 
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle .PERIOD 
You may ,COMMA or may not have noticed that i'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead .PERIOD 
Let me show you what it looks like .PERIOD 
Or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ?QUESTIONMARK 
I may also be interested in knowing how focused i am .PERIOD So i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side .PERIOD 
And that was responsiveness .PERIOD 
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that .PERIOD 
In the original zen bound game ,COMMA you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad .PERIOD 
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used ,COMMA or what your high score is .PERIOD But what was going on inside of your mind .PERIOD 
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So i used to get my eyes tested just for fun .PERIOD 
So let me just tell you the great part of all of this .PERIOD 
And so when i heard that eye specialist tell me all the things ,COMMA a big fat .PERIOD No ,COMMA everybody imagines i was devastated .PERIOD 
The first thing i thought about was my mom ,COMMA who was crying over beside me .PERIOD 
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad ,COMMA and i would drive .PERIOD 
Oh for the love of god .PERIOD 
I just was so -- how do i tell him .PERIOD 
And then he said to me ,COMMA what did you want to be when you were little .PERIOD 
I know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand .PERIOD 
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers .PERIOD 
And nobody can tell me no .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA you can say ,COMMA i can't be an archeologist .PERIOD 
I'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant .PERIOD 
And i never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing .PERIOD 
And consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us .PERIOD 
I hope it's not the curb cut between the chuck e ,COMMA cheese ,COMMA and the target store because that's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for .PERIOD 
This is the other side of the building .PERIOD 
And what is the message that is coming ?QUESTIONMARK What are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building ?QUESTIONMARK And how is it informing us about who we are .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a dvd player .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building .PERIOD And this is what happened .PERIOD When ,COMMA in glens falls new york .PERIOD When we tried to do it again ,COMMA where it was missing right .PERIOD 
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb :COLON the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside .PERIOD Every night .PERIOD 
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .PERIOD 
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD I can't see .PERIOD 
So they take the first one that comes along often .PERIOD 
We're going to have to do something else .PERIOD Instead .PERIOD 
So that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance .PERIOD 
The dead malls :COLON what are we going to do with them .PERIOD 
No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running the way we're running .PERIOD It .PERIOD 
We're going to have to do everything very differently .PERIOD 
And america's not prepared .PERIOD 
And within that context ,COMMA we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .PERIOD 
All materials are available for use .PERIOD 
It's a great honor today to share with you the digital universe ,COMMA which was created for humanity ,COMMA to really see where we are in the universe .PERIOD 
Nasa supported this work <NUM> years ago ,COMMA as part of the rebuilding of the hayden planetarium ,COMMA so that we would share this with the world .PERIOD 
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called earth matters on the lower east side of manhattan where i live .PERIOD And it was done as a collaborative project with the rubin museum of himalayan art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .PERIOD 
But this our containment of the visible universe .PERIOD 
This map can be updated ,COMMA and we can add in new data .PERIOD 
We have a growing user base of this .PERIOD And we network domes .PERIOD 
So you're seeing the edge of the earth .PERIOD 
This is nepal and tibet .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So he figures out a way to download himself into his environment ,COMMA actually into a series of books .PERIOD 
I think that this is the future of interface .PERIOD It's the future of music .PERIOD The future of instruments .PERIOD 
And i'll let adam tell you .PERIOD So adam is a phd .PERIOD Student at mit an expert in music technology and medicine and adam ,COMMA and dan have become close collaborators .PERIOD 
Adam boulanger :COLON yes .PERIOD So tod and i entered into a discussion following the tewksbury work ,COMMA and it was really about how dan is an expressive person .PERIOD And he's an intelligent and creative person .PERIOD And it's in his face .PERIOD It's in his breathing .PERIOD It's in his eyes .PERIOD How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music ?QUESTIONMARK That's our responsibility .PERIOD And it doesn't make sense .PERIOD 
But what about expression ?QUESTIONMARK What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work ,COMMA you know ,COMMA do our technologies allow us to express .PERIOD 
So let's do it .PERIOD So dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play ?QUESTIONMARK Now .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he can go in hyperscore ,COMMA you start out by making melodies .PERIOD And rhythms .PERIOD 
He can place those exactly where he wants .PERIOD 
But instead of making it very literal ,COMMA showing you exactly the camera tracing ,COMMA we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement and shows the way it's being analyzed .PERIOD 
Yeah .PERIOD 
And these women sing an enchanting song ,COMMA a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die .PERIOD 
I want to hear that song ,COMMA untie me .PERIOD 
There is first the present self .PERIOD 
Well resisting temptation is hard as the 19th century .PERIOD English economist nassau william senior said ,COMMA to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power ,COMMA or to seek distant rather than immediate results are among the most painful exertions of the human will .PERIOD 
So the first is when you've got one of these devices going ,COMMA such as this contract to write everyday or pay ,COMMA it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .PERIOD 
The other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .PERIOD 
And this is a timely issue .PERIOD 
And we're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers ,COMMA the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they're in retirement .PERIOD 
He said that we might neglect our future selves because of some failure of belief or imagination .PERIOD 
When you make an investment ,COMMA what you're really saying is i accept that any one of these <NUM> things could happen to me and determine my wealth .PERIOD 
Once you find an investment that you're happy with what people do is they click done .PERIOD And the markers begin to disappear .PERIOD Slowly ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD 
If you save very little ,COMMA the future self is unhappy living on <NUM> percent of the income .PERIOD 
And what's nice about it is it's not something that biasing people actually ,COMMA because as one face smiles ,COMMA the other face frowns .PERIOD 
There are programs .PERIOD You can get to see how people might look if they smoke if they get too much exposure to the sun ,COMMA if they gain weight .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
Hal is here .PERIOD So i think we owe it to him as well as yourself to disabuse you of that last image .PERIOD 
I began my life as a markets professional ,COMMA and continued to take an interest .PERIOD But most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature ,COMMA and which doesn't get priced by the markets .PERIOD 
And the answer is ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it can .PERIOD 
Biodiversity :COLON the living fabric of this planet is not a gas .PERIOD 
And if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish .PERIOD 
And at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions .PERIOD A health problem of a kind we haven't seen before .PERIOD 
The green represents the percentage .PERIOD 
The reason this is happening ,COMMA boils down ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD 
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth .PERIOD It's common goods .PERIOD 
It causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost ,COMMA health cost ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
When we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD 
When we measure corporate performances :COLON we don't include our impacts on nature ,COMMA and what our business costs society .PERIOD 
That has to stop .PERIOD 
So clearly ,COMMA there was a problem with deforestation .PERIOD 
And i couldn't answer because neither of these companies good ,COMMA though they are and professional ,COMMA though they are ,COMMA do not calculate ,COMMA or disclose their externalities .PERIOD 
That's an example i think for us to look at and for us ,COMMA to draw comfort from .PERIOD 
If more companies did this ,COMMA and if more sectors engaged this as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts ,COMMA business analysts ,COMMA and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies .PERIOD 
Has already set up a coalition to do this ,COMMA an international coalition .PERIOD 
A bit like inflation .PERIOD You over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see .PERIOD Declining prices .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in selecting targets of <NUM> parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations .PERIOD What we have done is we've made an ethical choice .PERIOD 
I decided when i was asked to do this ,COMMA that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend ,COMMA richard feynman .PERIOD 
Richard :COLON feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD 
He was a man of many ,COMMA many parts .PERIOD 
It may still exist .PERIOD I don't know .PERIOD 
But it was really brutal .PERIOD 
But the amazing thing was -- feynman had to leave a little early .PERIOD 
Sometimes i would win ,COMMA mostly .PERIOD He would win .PERIOD But we both enjoyed them .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA leonardo ,COMMA were you closer to your mother or to you father .PERIOD When you were a kid .PERIOD 
Being :COLON dick ,COMMA he ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wanted to check this .PERIOD 
There went that theory down the trashcan of history .PERIOD 
But let me tell you a little bit about feynman ;SEMICOLON the physicist .PERIOD 
He would try to visualize it ,COMMA guided by a small number of simple principles .PERIOD 
It was so simple ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that i suspect a really smart high school student who didn't even have calculus ,COMMA could understand what he wrote down .PERIOD 
You simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i think i'll just finish up by saying ,COMMA i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
When this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley ,COMMA i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer .PERIOD 
I decided i had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of airstream .PERIOD 
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together ,COMMA where you can change materials and shapes .PERIOD 
That's the trailer pretty much finished .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA finally ,COMMA oh yeah ,COMMA great big company .PERIOD I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding .PERIOD 
Welcome to five dangerous things .PERIOD You should let your children do .PERIOD 
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .PERIOD 
So where does this trend ?QUESTIONMARK Stop .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves .PERIOD 
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA 3d understanding ,COMMA and structural problem solving .PERIOD So it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .PERIOD 
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .PERIOD 
And it's fun for the whole family .PERIOD 
Narrator ,COMMA we are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us .PERIOD Arthritis .PERIOD 
This is the field of biologic replacements ,COMMA where we replace worn-out parts with new natural ones .PERIOD 
And it works not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly ,COMMA for other patients .PERIOD 
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue .PERIOD 
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?QUESTIONMARK 
The space age began <NUM> years ago ,COMMA in october ,COMMA and that’s exactly what sputnik looked like .PERIOD 
They would bring them back ,COMMA and mount them .PERIOD 
So that’s for fun .PERIOD 
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in <NUM> .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA nobody could read .PERIOD 
But why is this so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK Here’s the quick story .PERIOD 
That is why the printing press succeeded ,COMMA and that is why martin luther nailed his <NUM> theses to the door .PERIOD Because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .PERIOD 
Instead of showing an object from the stage ,COMMA i’m going to do something special for the first time .PERIOD 
We are going to show ,COMMA actually what the library looks like ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
And all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule .PERIOD 
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet .PERIOD 
What that means is ,COMMA a 200-megabyte file looks like this ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD Ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
The :COLON ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design .PERIOD 
So then i can add some color in with the background and add a bit more color in with the words themselves .PERIOD And this way ,COMMA working with the art director ,COMMA i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that ;SEMICOLON there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read .PERIOD 
So i'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word ,COMMA as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD 
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since <NUM> .PERIOD 
There's a longer story to this ,COMMA but i did get them all done in time ,COMMA and they were extremely well .PERIOD Received .PERIOD 
I got an almost <NUM> percent response rate .PERIOD 
I had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter ,COMMA like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD 
And i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect .PERIOD 
I'm certain i can see you blushing .PERIOD 
So i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards ,COMMA and i made <NUM> of these .PERIOD 
What does it say .PERIOD 
So that's why i do what i do ,COMMA and why i spend so much time and effort on it and why i work in the commercial public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art .PERIOD Because i want as many people as possible to see my work ,COMMA notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from it .PERIOD 
And i actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth ,COMMA in this way .PERIOD 
And i thank you for allowing me to show it to you .PERIOD 
The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground .PERIOD 
He's now keeping a constant distance to thomas .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these .PERIOD 
And i say ,COMMA what is the light bulb good for .PERIOD 
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone ,COMMA it's pretty much every direction .PERIOD 
I got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard .PERIOD 
You have to be kind of smart .PERIOD And though i did not graduate from college .PERIOD Doesn't mean i'm stupid ,COMMA because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world .PERIOD Today .PERIOD 
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics .PERIOD 
I have been really lucky with this technology .PERIOD All of a sudden as it is ready ,COMMA the world is ready to accept it .PERIOD 
This unit that i played goes from about <NUM> hertz to above the range of hearing .PERIOD 
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about <NUM> vibrations per second .PERIOD 
And the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face ,COMMA is made out in front of it in the air .PERIOD 
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist .PERIOD Some biblical verse .PERIOD 
We put it on a turret with a camera ,COMMA so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there ,COMMA and it's there .PERIOD 
I took it back to the pentagon after it ,COMMA got declassified ,COMMA when the patent issued ,COMMA and told the people back there about it ,COMMA and they laughed .PERIOD And then i took them back a demo ,COMMA and they bought .PERIOD 
So i've been really lucky as an inventor .PERIOD 
I've got a coke can opening .PERIOD That's right in your head .PERIOD That's really cool .PERIOD 
Appreciate it very much .PERIOD 
I thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .PERIOD 
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials ,COMMA and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .PERIOD 
So that's the vision that i've been thinking about .PERIOD 
There's diatoms made out of sio2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small ,COMMA single-domain magnets used for navigation .PERIOD 
And i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit ,COMMA and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD 
What if he says 'oh i already have one' or 'i've already memorized ,COMMA it' .PERIOD 
Now if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything .PERIOD You want on the periodic table .PERIOD 
So basically viruses can't replicate themselves ;SEMICOLON they need a host .PERIOD 
And so through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking ,COMMA high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature .PERIOD Basically ,COMMA at the bench top .PERIOD 
You can make lots of amplifications to it .PERIOD 
When you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out .PERIOD 
The last example are solar cells .PERIOD 
And what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD 
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement ,COMMA the coffee shop ,COMMA the library .PERIOD 
And then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car -- so the commute .PERIOD 
Why is that happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
You don't have a workday anymore ;SEMICOLON you have work moments .PERIOD 
It's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart .PERIOD And you walk in ,COMMA and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have <NUM> minutes here and <NUM> minutes there ,COMMA and then something else happens ,COMMA and you're pulled off your work ,COMMA and you've got to do something else .PERIOD Then you have <NUM> minutes .PERIOD Then it's lunch .PERIOD 
I sat at my desk .PERIOD I used my expensive computer .PERIOD 
You might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully .PERIOD You need long stretches of uninterrupted time .PERIOD 
Now there are different kinds of distractions .PERIOD But there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute .PERIOD 
So sleep is about sleep phases ,COMMA or stages -- some people call them different things .PERIOD 
If you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD 
I don't think anyone would say yes .PERIOD 
They'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i can't see the person ,COMMA how do i know they're working ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's one of the excuses that managers give .PERIOD 
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for <NUM> minutes ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD So why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there or twitter here ,COMMA and there or youtube here ?QUESTIONMARK And there .PERIOD 
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .PERIOD 
That's kind of bad .PERIOD 
And meetings are just toxic ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day .PERIOD At work .PERIOD 
What if they're doing important work .PERIOD 
If there are <NUM> people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10-hour meeting .PERIOD It's not a one-hour meeting .PERIOD 
It's <NUM> hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .PERIOD 
These things don't exist outside of the office .PERIOD 
I have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly .PERIOD 
I don't know if people still do that .PERIOD 
So just the afternoon ,COMMA one ,COMMA thursday .PERIOD 
This is when people actually get stuff done is when no one's bothering them .PERIOD When no one's interrupting them .PERIOD 
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at <NUM> am on monday .PERIOD Just forget about them .PERIOD And things will be just fine .PERIOD 
And i specialize in human behavioral research .PERIOD And applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways ,COMMA and to design for that future .PERIOD 
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that .PERIOD 
So this is interesting to us ,COMMA because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual ,COMMA emotional or functional value .PERIOD 
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys ,COMMA money .PERIOD And if they own one ,COMMA a mobile phone .PERIOD 
And a mobile phone .PERIOD It turns out ,COMMA is a great recovery tool .PERIOD 
But -- and it's a pretty big ,COMMA but -- we forget .PERIOD 
I think quite a nice feature .PERIOD 
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity ,COMMA but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD 
But the difference between this and that is there's no central authority trying to control this .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA ok ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier .PERIOD 
They'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It challenges ,COMMA the norms .PERIOD 
This is how it's shifting .PERIOD 
I'm just the messenger .PERIOD 
And companies like navigenics ,COMMA and dna ,COMMA direct and 23andme that are giving you your genetic profiles ,COMMA are giving some people a sense of gosh ,COMMA well ,COMMA what can i do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so my request is ,COMMA please ,COMMA let's make technologies that make people more human and not less .PERIOD 
I made a lot of mistakes ,COMMA and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
So let's say ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding .PERIOD And you're trying to get to the airport ,COMMA and you're stuck in terrible traffic .PERIOD And you finally arrive at your gate ,COMMA and you've missed your flight .PERIOD 
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have .PERIOD 
Odds .PERIOD Are you're not going to care in five years .PERIOD 
It feels terrible .PERIOD Regret ,COMMA feels awful .PERIOD 
And the thought was make it go away .PERIOD 
We just want it to vanish .PERIOD 
Make it go away ,COMMA make it go away .PERIOD 
In point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy .PERIOD 
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change .PERIOD And we cannot .PERIOD 
But first ,COMMA i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about .PERIOD 
The fda estimates that of all the americans who have tattoos ,COMMA <NUM> percent of us regret getting them .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem ,COMMA because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're <NUM> years old ,COMMA and you want your mommy because you don't like your new tattoo .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD 
And what i loved about :COLON this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image .PERIOD 
Even in wealthy countries ,COMMA it is common .PERIOD Now to see inequality growing .PERIOD 
In the united states since <NUM> ,COMMA we've had five years of economic growth ,COMMA five years of productivity growth in the workplace .PERIOD But median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below .PERIOD The poverty line is up by four percent .PERIOD 
It is also unstable .PERIOD 
Because primarily of the power of the internet ,COMMA people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good .PERIOD If they all agree .PERIOD 
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with aids drugs .PERIOD 
When i got out of office and was asked to work first in the caribbean ,COMMA to try to help deal with the aids crisis ,COMMA generic drugs were available for about <NUM> dollars a person a year .PERIOD 
We need a movie on those six categories .PERIOD 
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it .PERIOD 
You think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however many obstacles you have faced in your life ,COMMA at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved .PERIOD 
As poor ,COMMA as haiti is ,COMMA in the area where farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve -- since <NUM> ,COMMA they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one .PERIOD 
We're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti :COLON he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed ,COMMA and take their medicine regularly ,COMMA who work on bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it .PERIOD 
The procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as i said by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country ,COMMA and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .PERIOD 
And then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD 
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay .PERIOD 
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis .PERIOD 
Listen to this :COLON less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD 
We're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation ,COMMA folks to scale this system up .PERIOD 
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health administration and community health workers throughout the country ,COMMA to set up the information technology .PERIOD The solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD 
I had a really hard time in school .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD 
I ran away .PERIOD 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
They know they can control their world .PERIOD 
Landscaping .PERIOD 
They're part of the rice cycle ,COMMA and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD 
The food is incredible .PERIOD 
Green school is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD 
The kids are from <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
You practice ,COMMA ancient ,COMMA balinese arts .PERIOD 
The kids love it .PERIOD 
And together ,COMMA these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders .PERIOD 
The green school effect -- we don't know what it is .PERIOD 
And how did we do all this .PERIOD 
It's a double helix .PERIOD 
From the time ,COMMA the foundations were finished in three months .PERIOD It had roofs and floors .PERIOD 
You ruined my life .PERIOD But you gave me an incredible future .PERIOD 
And then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together pretty well until it failed .PERIOD 
I tried out various computer voices that were available online .PERIOD And for several months ,COMMA i had a british accent ,COMMA which chaz called sir lawrence .PERIOD 
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices .PERIOD And i've experimented with them .PERIOD 
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?QUESTIONMARK 
But it wasn't that simple .PERIOD 
Or roger <NUM> .PERIOD 
This is the first version of my computer voice .PERIOD 
When i read something it will read in my voice .PERIOD 
The voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc .PERIOD 
I plan to use it on television radio and the internet .PERIOD 
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems .PERIOD 
John hunter :COLON all my life i was a motormouth .PERIOD 
I doubt on that day ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .PERIOD 
But that's not the point .PERIOD 
I have learned from wikipedia ,COMMA that starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA plato established forums ,COMMA message boards ,COMMA online testing ,COMMA email ,COMMA chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages ,COMMA instant messaging ,COMMA remote screen sharing and multiple-player games .PERIOD 
But online ,COMMA everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD 
Ironic that my legs are fine ,COMMA and it's my shoulders that slow up .PERIOD My walk .PERIOD

Let me tell you my story .PERIOD 
I came to london ,COMMA and i've seen performance by cirque du soleil .PERIOD 
I wanted my artistic statement ,COMMA my interpretation of reality .PERIOD 
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece ,COMMA as one composition -- like music .PERIOD 
And design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD 
What really makes it amazing ,COMMA that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .PERIOD 
Same in poland ,COMMA plus <NUM> up to <NUM> percent ,COMMA raise of circulation after three years .PERIOD 
You can work for a small company in a boring ,COMMA branch .PERIOD 
So bear with me as i take you through this journey .PERIOD 
I was running across the street .PERIOD And the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD 
And i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth .PERIOD 
I had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened ,COMMA kept my heart moving ,COMMA beating .PERIOD 
I had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way .PERIOD 
And i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk .PERIOD 
The redundancy was actually good for me .PERIOD 
So everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted .PERIOD 
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration .PERIOD When i had my accident .PERIOD 
A peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ,COMMA ran towards where the gunshot had come from .PERIOD And found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD 
Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died ;SEMICOLON the next day in the arms of his brother .PERIOD 
And the last words he said to his brother were ,COMMA don't cry for me ,COMMA alfred .PERIOD 
But a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .PERIOD 
Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the large hadron collider in cern .PERIOD 
Artists too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD 
Here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in the magic mountain .PERIOD 
And the gateway ,COMMA you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them .PERIOD 
And i said to professor kurokawa ,COMMA wow ,COMMA the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake ,COMMA and put this one upside down .PERIOD 
Recently ,COMMA i took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love .PERIOD 
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world .PERIOD We live in .PERIOD 
So they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD 
And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another ,COMMA to change geometry into language .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century ad by the indians .PERIOD 
I can reflect it in the line through x or the line ,COMMA through y or the line through z .PERIOD 
So both of these objects have six symmetries .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the little table here records ,COMMA how the algebra of these symmetries work .PERIOD 
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries ,COMMA so ,COMMA why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries ?QUESTIONMARK 
And using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries .PERIOD 
And all the tiles match up ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
So there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn ,COMMA where the z pieces meet .PERIOD 
How many symmetries does a rubik's cube have .PERIOD 
Rather than you all shouting out ,COMMA i want you to count .PERIOD How many digits there are in that number ?QUESTIONMARK Okay .PERIOD 
Because this one ,COMMA i think there were a few here .PERIOD 
The people who just last sat down .PERIOD 
And i'd like to review just how unintended consequences play the part that they do .PERIOD 
But he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD 
So there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science ,COMMA as well as to applied science and medicine .PERIOD 
There are two historians of business at the university of maryland brent goldfarb .PERIOD And david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work ,COMMA much of it still unpublished ,COMMA on the history of major innovations .PERIOD 
They have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number ,COMMA the greatest decade ,COMMA for fundamental innovations ,COMMA as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the great depression .PERIOD 
So we see that sometimes ,COMMA as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference ,COMMA that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity .PERIOD 
We need to see what they can do for us .PERIOD 
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing .PERIOD 
And some of those ,COMMA we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system .PERIOD 
Also just like paper ,COMMA around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later .PERIOD And i can do the same thing here and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA one thing we have for that is like a grid align ,COMMA kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop .PERIOD Things are kind of grid aligned .PERIOD 
The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there .PERIOD 
But i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth ,COMMA and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA it's funny .PERIOD You ask that because it's actually called black box trading .PERIOD 
There's a company in boston called nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic .PERIOD And i don't know what ,COMMA and they reach into all the market data .PERIOD And they find ,COMMA actually ,COMMA sometimes some of these algorithms .PERIOD 
And when they find them ,COMMA they pull them out ,COMMA and they pin them to the wall ,COMMA like butterflies .PERIOD 
Pragmatic chaos is ,COMMA like all of netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD 
Pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines ,COMMA in the end .PERIOD <NUM> percent of what movies end up being rented .PERIOD 
Wouldn't that be handy .PERIOD 
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm .PERIOD 
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city .PERIOD 
But before i dive into those ,COMMA i want to admit that i am an optimist .PERIOD 
And part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .PERIOD 
Another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths .PERIOD 
The next breakthrough is to cut that <NUM> million in half again .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths :COLON diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria .PERIOD 
And the disease was all over the world .PERIOD 
And two tools helped bring the death rate down .PERIOD 
But malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .PERIOD 
Over :COLON <NUM> million people at any one time are suffering from it .PERIOD 
And bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD 
So every tool that we've ever had in the past ,COMMA has eventually become ineffective .PERIOD 
It involves communicators to keep the funding high ,COMMA to keep the visibility high ,COMMA to tell the success stories .PERIOD 
It involves social scientists ,COMMA so we know how to get not just <NUM> percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD 
Let's start with why this is important .PERIOD 
Not only has that been weak ?QUESTIONMARK It's getting weaker .PERIOD 
And the answer is no .PERIOD 
But it in no way ,COMMA is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD 
They have <NUM> schools -- mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching .PERIOD 
If you have a kid who's behind you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .PERIOD 
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book .PERIOD 
I only have three minutes ,COMMA so i'm going to have to talk fast .PERIOD And it will use up your spare mental cycles .PERIOD So multitasking may be hard .PERIOD 
So it's logical that you'd have one there on the minor road entering the major .PERIOD 
And so the question is :COLON what does that cost us .PERIOD 
That's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD There is also pollution ,COMMA wear on the car and time .PERIOD 
Discount that back to the present ,COMMA at five percent over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction .PERIOD 
Now if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property ,COMMA cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line ,COMMA and then sell it off again .PERIOD 
And because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .PERIOD 
And this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence .PERIOD 
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room ,COMMA when the patient's on the table .PERIOD 
But then we actually don't know that it's all out .PERIOD 
And we wait .PERIOD 
So now you're faced with telling your patient ,COMMA first of all that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy ,COMMA such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD 
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it .PERIOD 
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station ,COMMA you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .PERIOD 
So with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away .PERIOD 
Nerves if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis ,COMMA can cause pain .PERIOD 
But you know what ?QUESTIONMARK These little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer ,COMMA that they are actually never seen .PERIOD 
People said ,COMMA we've been doing it this way for all these years .PERIOD 
But i went ahead anyway .PERIOD 
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression ,COMMA for facial movement ,COMMA for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate .PERIOD 
I have patients who would benefit from this .PERIOD 
I think that this will result in my surgeries ,COMMA with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD 
And this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD 
And that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today .PERIOD 
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then ,COMMA if they pass a certain threshold ,COMMA will go to thousands of downstream partners .PERIOD 
If we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash ,COMMA what they can initiate and sustain .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the 20th century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders .PERIOD And while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them ,COMMA can be considered to be cured .PERIOD 
There's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen ,COMMA and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do we do this .PERIOD 
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .PERIOD 
And over time -- in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone .PERIOD 
The animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of like a deer in the headlights .PERIOD 
Now i want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules ,COMMA if you can do ultra-precise control ,COMMA can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic ,COMMA an optical prosthetic .PERIOD 
Maybe <NUM> people have cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear .PERIOD 
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have .PERIOD And it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .PERIOD 
And the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure .PERIOD 
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light ,COMMA sensitive .PERIOD 
So this pre-clinical study ,COMMA i think ,COMMA bodes hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future .PERIOD 
And by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less a zero .PERIOD 
Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them .PERIOD 
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors .PERIOD 
And we looked at three different types of rooms .PERIOD 
Hospitals ,COMMA use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings .PERIOD 
I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut .PERIOD 
And obviously ,COMMA i'm physically a very strong person ,COMMA as you can tell -- -- so i wasn't worried about carrying this thing .PERIOD <NUM> blocks .PERIOD 
People were out .PERIOD 
And i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city .PERIOD 
But the system itself of this city was thriving .PERIOD 
Everybody contributes a little bit .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it was the whole city .PERIOD 
So it's been a very optimistic time ,COMMA i think .PERIOD And i want to just talk about a few of those things .PERIOD 
That is -- you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that .PERIOD I think ,COMMA which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it .PERIOD And somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link .PERIOD 
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship .PERIOD 
About two months ago ,COMMA i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result .PERIOD For steven johnson .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA i think that's not entirely true anymore .PERIOD 
That little list there would change .PERIOD 
That's not necessarily something we didn't know already .PERIOD 
I had no idea .PERIOD 
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things ,COMMA and get a sense of what else is out there .PERIOD 
They're talking about slavery in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA ok ,COMMA i didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious .PERIOD 
I'll go very quickly .PERIOD 
It's caused a lot of controversy ,COMMA because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice .PERIOD Heard .PERIOD 
And the question was ,COMMA were the birds singing .PERIOD 
Well in my world ,COMMA this is a rubber duck .PERIOD 
That was a nice thing to get .PERIOD 
If the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great .PERIOD 
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility ,COMMA and in my business as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead .PERIOD 
There is an infinite game ,COMMA and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD 
And so we call it cradle to cradle .PERIOD And our goal is very simple .PERIOD 
This is what i presented to the white house .PERIOD 
So we've designed products ,COMMA and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million .PERIOD 
We can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice ?QUESTIONMARK Blindness .PERIOD 
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe .PERIOD 
Here's dr .PERIOD Venkataswamy .PERIOD In india ,COMMA who's figured out how to do mass-produced health .PERIOD 
They become building steel .PERIOD 
My childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington among the first growth and big growth .PERIOD 
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics ,COMMA so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA here i am ,COMMA graduating from high school in <NUM> .PERIOD And this happens .PERIOD And we realize that away went away .PERIOD 
Now if we look at the word competition ,COMMA i'm sure most of you've used it .PERIOD 
You know most people don't realize it comes from the latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together .PERIOD 
It means the way olympic athletes train with each other .PERIOD 
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD 
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good ,COMMA because in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words :COLON assigning blame .PERIOD 
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition .PERIOD 
Customers .PERIOD 
Biotechnical nutrients -- the model u for ford motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car -- concept car .PERIOD 
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever .PERIOD Some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered .PERIOD 
We're doing <NUM> cities for china right now ,COMMA based on cradle to cradle as templates .PERIOD 
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for <NUM> million people in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
We start to integrate commercial ,COMMA and mixed use .PERIOD So the people all have centers and places to be .PERIOD 
And then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD 
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .PERIOD 
They're probably less cell dense .PERIOD 
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .PERIOD 
Because what we're trying to measure the rna -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile .PERIOD And so we have to move very quickly .PERIOD 
And then the laser actually cuts .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .PERIOD 
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint .PERIOD If you will ,COMMA quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .PERIOD 
So roughly we have <NUM> million data points for a given human brain .PERIOD 
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on .PERIOD 
Genes :COLON send the instructions to make proteins .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA drugs ,COMMA bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
It's as interesting a side effect ,COMMA as it could be .PERIOD 
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can ,COMMA because it's a pattern matching exercise .PERIOD Because there's unique fingerprint .PERIOD We can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint .PERIOD 
Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .PERIOD 
And then we find some outliers ,COMMA some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD 
And those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle .PERIOD 
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type .PERIOD 
I think these resources are incredibly valuable .PERIOD 
And there is something else .PERIOD I believe in the back of your mind .PERIOD You also know .PERIOD 
And worst of all ,COMMA we will never know .PERIOD 
And the reason is that -- take africa ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
Africans have already got a lot of aid .PERIOD 
We don't know .PERIOD 
And a third question education .PERIOD 
And in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works ,COMMA what doesn't work .PERIOD And why .PERIOD 
It's going from intention to action .PERIOD 
We cannot keep giving lentils to people .PERIOD 
We can just run an experiment .PERIOD 
Second thing is ,COMMA how about the use .PERIOD 
Well in business ,COMMA that's certainly not the way we would go about it .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to show you what we get with various education .PERIOD Interventions .PERIOD 
So now i started from the big problem ,COMMA and i couldn't answer it .PERIOD 
In haiti about <NUM> people died -- actually a bit more by the latest estimate .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why is that .PERIOD 
With deworming ,COMMA you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .PERIOD 
So this evidence is powerful .PERIOD 
It can prompt action .PERIOD 
These economics i'm proposing .PERIOD It's like 20th century medicine .PERIOD 
Fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers .PERIOD 
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA i want to write a case .PERIOD Euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD 
The first thing that i saw was north america at night -- glowing ,COMMA in all its glory ,COMMA a warm feeling light .PERIOD 
Entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope .PERIOD 
So let's start shedding light on this amazing ,COMMA eclectic continent that has so much to offer .PERIOD 
So i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals ,COMMA or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping this continent .PERIOD 
And let's start at the high level on the macro-factors .PERIOD 
Egypt from the <NUM> percent to about <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
But what were they there for to acquire assets .PERIOD 
Guarantee ,COMMA trust bank recently ,COMMA issued the first euro bond out of africa .PERIOD And this excludes south africa .PERIOD 
<NUM> to <NUM> million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as kuwait ,COMMA the same league ,COMMA as venezuela .PERIOD 
So let's unpack those very quickly ,COMMA and i'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA because i can see that clock counting down .PERIOD 
What else is going on there ?QUESTIONMARK Egypt ?QUESTIONMARK 
Close to the mediterranean near alexandria -- textiles ,COMMA petrochemicals .PERIOD 
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's going on in some of the other countries .PERIOD 
But in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is :COLON what is my alternative investment ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things ,COMMA comparisons become important .PERIOD 
In :COLON <NUM> :COLON joseph conrad released the heart of darkness a tale of grim horror along the congo river .PERIOD 
Brain magic ,COMMA to me ,COMMA indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects .PERIOD 
So now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind .PERIOD Once you know how .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA but you're ok .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA weird .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to give you some demonstrations up here .PERIOD Live right now .PERIOD 
And let's see down at the end here .PERIOD Can you also come up real quick .PERIOD 
Now it's very important for everybody here to realize i haven't set anything up with you guys .PERIOD 
You don't know what's about to happen .PERIOD Is that agreed ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok ,COMMA would you mind just standing over here for a moment .PERIOD 
Your name is .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA a little bit closer come over -- they look really nervous up here .PERIOD 
Voodoo .PERIOD 
Besides who's next ?QUESTIONMARK No ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
I want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything until i ask you ,COMMA and don't open your eyes until i ask you .PERIOD 
Yes or no ,COMMA did you feel anything .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA i walk around nightclubs all night like this .PERIOD 
And can you take a seat right over here for me ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD 
And i want you to hold it there just for a moment .PERIOD And i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA and only when you feel the pressure go back .PERIOD I want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop ,COMMA but only when you feel the pressure .PERIOD 
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop .PERIOD Keep your eyes ,COMMA closed .PERIOD 
Can you stand up .PERIOD 
Imagine a connection between you and him .PERIOD 
Point directly at his forehead .PERIOD 
Now i want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when i snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open again .PERIOD 
It's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA psychokinesis ,COMMA is the paranormal ;SEMICOLON influence of the mind on physical events and processes .PERIOD 
Be careful ,COMMA because it is sharp just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD 
And i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side .PERIOD 
There's five letters in the title .PERIOD 
There's a k in his name .PERIOD There is a k .PERIOD 
You knew .PERIOD 
No one in the audience .PERIOD And just to help you out ,COMMA i'll block them from view ,COMMA so nobody can see what you're doing .PERIOD 
But i don't want you to know either .PERIOD So swivel around on your chair .PERIOD 
Your right hand is that -- no ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA tell me when to stop .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA there's one .PERIOD 
Ok :COLON do you think it's here ?QUESTIONMARK Yes ,COMMA or no ?QUESTIONMARK 
Neither oh ok .PERIOD 
We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .PERIOD 
After <NUM> years of experiments ,COMMA i found it .PERIOD 
It can't be that important .PERIOD 
Turns out it wasn't so easy .PERIOD 
And when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life ,COMMA and degrades rapidly at room temperature .PERIOD 
Then i had to measure morality .PERIOD 
So i started smaller .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA poor countries are by and large ,COMMA low trust countries .PERIOD 
So we recruit some people for an experiment .PERIOD 
We give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD 
So think about this experiment for minute .PERIOD 
But why .PERIOD 
Two things .PERIOD 
I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD 
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD 
These include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD 
In this book smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason .PERIOD 
So if i do something that hurts you ,COMMA i feel that pain .PERIOD 
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara ,COMMA california .PERIOD 
Tell that guy to wait half an hour .PERIOD 
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop .PERIOD And i was the pigeon .PERIOD 
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD 
One is through improper nurturing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've studied sexually abused women ,COMMA and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD 
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin .PERIOD 
So i think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us emotionally .PERIOD 
So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr .PERIOD Love .PERIOD 
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .PERIOD 
And they're happier because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD

So ,COMMA basically ,COMMA with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume ,COMMA and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes .PERIOD When really it's continuously going .PERIOD 
Maybe we'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going .PERIOD 
It was invented around the 1920s and the inventor ,COMMA léon theremin -- he also was a musician ,COMMA besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin .PERIOD I think ,COMMA when he was working on some shortwave radios .PERIOD 
And then also you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch .PERIOD Or sometimes ,COMMA if you're holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it .PERIOD 
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories or stories on the internet .PERIOD In a less linear form .PERIOD 
He was sent in <NUM> ,COMMA to palestine ,COMMA by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement .PERIOD

During the time i was in bosnia ,COMMA the mortal remains of zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals .PERIOD 
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate ,COMMA because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD 
It was released in poland ,COMMA to create friction between frank and hitler .PERIOD So that hitler would imagine frank ,COMMA was trying to usurp his power .PERIOD

I will follow .PERIOD The instructions :COLON the tempo markings ,COMMA the dynamics .PERIOD 
But here i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick .PERIOD 
Just the basic feeling .PERIOD 
We have to listen to ourselves .PERIOD First of all .PERIOD 
And i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum .PERIOD 
Not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them .PERIOD 
Can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there .PERIOD 
Every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting ,COMMA will experience this sound quite quite differently .PERIOD 
Do you see what i mean ?QUESTIONMARK So because of this explosion in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected how music institutions ,COMMA how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well .PERIOD 
May be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there .PERIOD 
We just -- we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that that's what deafness is about .PERIOD 
In a year's time ,COMMA it could be two extra steps .PERIOD

I may feel sorrowful ,COMMA or happy ,COMMA or exhilarated ,COMMA or angry when i play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD 
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc .PERIOD Or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass .PERIOD 
It's a video game move from star fox .PERIOD

It is where a third of all ,COMMA the traffic is going .PERIOD 
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site .PERIOD

Don't tell .PERIOD 
And saying ,COMMA whatever you like ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is powerful .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA i didn't make it into that presentation ,COMMA because i can't read to you anything that they said more or less .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA well .PERIOD 
You've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money yet .PERIOD

They did it within two or three degrees of the pole ,COMMA to maintain similarity between continents .PERIOD 
Now we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area .PERIOD 
I was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school .PERIOD 
What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids ,COMMA like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance ,COMMA and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology .PERIOD 
Because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,COMMA track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few .PERIOD If none .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
And as a little girl ,COMMA i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful ,COMMA trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us ,COMMA enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .PERIOD 
I almost lost it this week .PERIOD 
Leo :COLON this is cookie monster .PERIOD 
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person .PERIOD

Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,COMMA ran exactly the same dialogues .PERIOD

We've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD 
That's her competition .PERIOD

Well ,COMMA emily baer -- <NUM> runners -- she finishes in eighth place ,COMMA in the top <NUM> ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet ,COMMA beat <NUM> other people .PERIOD 
And you'll get slower and slower until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now i defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did ,COMMA as teenagers .PERIOD 
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if that's true a couple other things had to be true as well .PERIOD 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack .PERIOD 
You need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill .PERIOD And you need to have those teenagers there ,COMMA who are learning the whole thing all involved .PERIOD 
You can't be hauling all your crap around trying to chase the antelope .PERIOD

So ,COMMA hopefully it's something we can all benefit from .PERIOD 
I show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but i also make television programs ,COMMA books and some advertising .PERIOD All with the same concept .PERIOD 
I was fascinated by this phenomenon ,COMMA so i wondered :COLON could one erase the image of diana ,COMMA actually quite crudely and physically ?QUESTIONMARK 
Momentum was being built .PERIOD 
I then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image .PERIOD So i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in ,COMMA or existed in the public imagination .PERIOD 
So this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband ,COMMA and this was a sequence of images .PERIOD 
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss .PERIOD And i was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD The press were writing about this ,COMMA giving full pages about how terrible this was .PERIOD 
But then this changed suddenly .PERIOD 
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying ,COMMA there's this great image of the queen ,COMMA sitting outside william hill .PERIOD 
I explored ,COMMA with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself .PERIOD 
And me as the queen .PERIOD 
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality .PERIOD That obviously is completely constructed .PERIOD 
I did an advertising campaign for schweppes ,COMMA which is coca-cola .PERIOD And so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .PERIOD 
Tony blair and cherie and again ,COMMA the legalities -- we had to be very careful .PERIOD 
And the press were interviewing ,COMMA and i was signing my book .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA george bush and tony blair are having great fun during all of this .PERIOD 
So there was a lot of meaning in my life ,COMMA because i was performing this type of research during the day .PERIOD 
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place .PERIOD 
Our left hemisphere is all about the past ,COMMA and it's all about the future .PERIOD 
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .PERIOD 
I become a single solid individual ,COMMA separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .PERIOD 
And i looked down at my body and i thought ,COMMA whoa !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm a weird-looking thing .PERIOD And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality ,COMMA where i'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space ,COMMA where i'm witnessing myself having this experience .PERIOD 
I can't define where i begin ,COMMA and where i end ,COMMA because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .PERIOD 
And then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity .PERIOD 
And so i say to him -- clear in my mind ,COMMA i say to him ,COMMA this is jill .PERIOD I need help .PERIOD 
Nirvana ,COMMA i found nirvana .PERIOD And i remember thinking ,COMMA there's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body .PERIOD 
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage ,COMMA the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers .PERIOD

This is at the heart institute .PERIOD The doctors from anywhere can log in .PERIOD 
They'll give me that information ,COMMA and we'll make the care of the patient better .PERIOD 
Because if you can't get it in nashville ,COMMA you can travel to birmingham two hours away ,COMMA and you'll get it if you can't get it .PERIOD In cleveland ,COMMA you can go to cincinnati .PERIOD We don't have that luxury ,COMMA so we have to make it happen .PERIOD

Sharon lazarus :COLON i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean since the past two years .PERIOD I received training at this institution .PERIOD 
I think i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is .PERIOD

I thought ,COMMA everybody thought in pictures .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA there is my childhood church .PERIOD That's specific .PERIOD There's some more fort collins .PERIOD 
But one of the things that really worries me is where's the younger version of those kids going today ?QUESTIONMARK

And i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on ,COMMA and kind of ,COMMA get used to it ,COMMA and they got it bent .PERIOD So it's not hitting my chin .PERIOD

Are they friend or foe ?QUESTIONMARK Is there anybody ?QUESTIONMARK He can go mate with .PERIOD

I was a goofball student when i was in high school i just didn't care at all about studying until i had mr .PERIOD Carlock's science class .PERIOD 
And they're not going down the right path .PERIOD

In other words ,COMMA use that fixation in order to motivate that kid ,COMMA that's one of the things we need to do .PERIOD 
The pattern thinkers :COLON they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians :COLON your software engineers ,COMMA your computer programmers .PERIOD All of those kinds of jobs .PERIOD

It's real stuff .PERIOD 
So the idea is by watching saturn ,COMMA we're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale ,COMMA so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you think that those rings are very large objects .PERIOD 
That was [unclear] also -- you know ,COMMA because we were worried about the risk of it .PERIOD But it worked pretty well .PERIOD 
So people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold ,COMMA organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD 
So here we have a cycle of a planet ,COMMA which is like our earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane .PERIOD And organic material .PERIOD

It had three chemicals :COLON we were really surprised to see :COLON sulfur :COLON potassium nitrate and charcoal .PERIOD 
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard .PERIOD 
We have about <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA and we want to do it well .PERIOD 
The first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science ,COMMA is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong .PERIOD There is no method .PERIOD 
I’m not going to read them all to you ,COMMA because i’m not in teacher mode .PERIOD 
And i want to talk about three stages in that evolution .PERIOD 
In that year ,COMMA we are not available for any of our clients .PERIOD 
We are totally closed .PERIOD 
Quite the similar idea ,COMMA then ,COMMA a perfume packaged in a book ,COMMA in a die ,COMMA cut .PERIOD 
I likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays .PERIOD 
Europe and the us didn't really feel enticing because i knew them too well .PERIOD So asia .PERIOD It was .PERIOD 
So i looked for furniture .PERIOD 
So one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture .PERIOD 
And i think ,COMMA by the time this lamp came about ,COMMA i had finally made peace with those dogs .PERIOD 
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali .PERIOD 
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .PERIOD 
So i became my own intern .PERIOD 
I had fun .PERIOD 
Financially seen over the long term ,COMMA it was actually successful .PERIOD 
We were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem koolhaas-built music center in porto ,COMMA in portugal .PERIOD 
It has a more transparent identity .PERIOD 
Some of you might have seen it .PERIOD 
So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD 
So i'll just give you my message up front .PERIOD Try not to go extinct .PERIOD 
People ask me a lot -- in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions i get is :COLON why do children like dinosaurs so much ?QUESTIONMARK 
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better ,COMMA one than anybody else had .PERIOD 
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs .PERIOD 
And they thought about it ,COMMA and they even wrote papers about it .PERIOD Where are the little dinosaurs .PERIOD 
First off scientists have egos .PERIOD And scientists like to name dinosaurs .PERIOD 
So this is where people went astray ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
But i have a museum ,COMMA and i collect dinosaurs ,COMMA and i can saw mine open .PERIOD 
And if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive .PERIOD 
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD 
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike .PERIOD 
Dracorex !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is !EXCLAMATIONMARK The littlest one !EXCLAMATIONMARK Stygimoloch !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is the middle size .PERIOD One .PERIOD Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one .PERIOD 
But it didn't give them a clue .PERIOD 
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward .PERIOD 
If you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles .PERIOD And then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD 
And we get rid of anatotitan .PERIOD 
So again ,COMMA real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus ,COMMA and therefore we can take out another dinosaur .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders .PERIOD 
This is soft sell for 42nd street .PERIOD 
They weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government ,COMMA while they were helping us with this .PERIOD 
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open .PERIOD 
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances .PERIOD They asked us to bring an intimacy .PERIOD 
And this is a mockup that is in salt lake city .PERIOD That gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale .PERIOD 
Chris ,COMMA has been so nice .PERIOD 
So nice all week ,COMMA he's the kind of man you could say to chris ,COMMA i'm really sorry .PERIOD I've crashed your car .PERIOD 
And you know that chris would say thank you .PERIOD 
Emmanuel !EXCLAMATIONMARK Absolutely .PERIOD 
So that's going to look pretty shabby .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
So what i thought i'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is what i can do is to launch today .PERIOD The first ted global auction .PERIOD 
And he'll say ,COMMA you're offering me things that are infinitely variable .PERIOD 
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link .PERIOD 
This .PERIOD Man has swum around the north pole .PERIOD What more evidence ?QUESTIONMARK Do you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
No .PERIOD 
Alright ,COMMA it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain' .PERIOD You know ,COMMA i wrote to him just before i left office .PERIOD I said ,COMMA 'can .PERIOD I rely on your support for the next month' .PERIOD And he wrote back .PERIOD He said ,COMMA 'no ,COMMA you can't' which kind of surprised me ?QUESTIONMARK Because i'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before .PERIOD 
When you think what's happened to financial services ,COMMA and you see what's happened to the economy ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA iceland ,COMMA it was never going to cut it .PERIOD 
Luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful .PERIOD 
He summed it up really at a dinner .PERIOD 
And then you're now ,COMMA well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sorry about that .PERIOD 
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So he comes over to this country and he says ,COMMA we need a big fiscal stimulus .PERIOD 
He goes to prague .PERIOD He says ,COMMA we believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD 
Do you remember that george bush ,COMMA a nu-ca-ler .PERIOD 
Who said ,COMMA reach out and touch .PERIOD 
So nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature .PERIOD 
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .PERIOD 
And it has close to <NUM> such plants for <NUM> occupants .PERIOD 
Our studies have found that there is a <NUM> percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent .PERIOD If one stays indoors in this building for <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
And the study showed that compared to other buildings ,COMMA there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by <NUM> percent ,COMMA respiratory systems by <NUM> percent .PERIOD Headaches by <NUM> percent ,COMMA lung impairment by <NUM> percent and asthma by nine percent .PERIOD 
Why is this important .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you feel about that -- the whole -- ma ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating actually ,COMMA because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .PERIOD 
And no guy ,COMMA ever gets criticized ,COMMA but that's the least of it .PERIOD 
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world ,COMMA and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD 
And so how did you handle that .PERIOD 
Because in her lifetime -- ma ,COMMA that would be so .PERIOD 
Thank you for joining us today .PERIOD 
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna .PERIOD 
And if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation as i do ,COMMA then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist .PERIOD 
This is exactly analogous to the question :COLON what's the smallest program i can write that ?QUESTIONMARK Will act exactly like microsoft word .PERIOD 
And just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller ,COMMA he's writing genomes that will work .PERIOD We could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .PERIOD 
Now these are big questions in computer .PERIOD Science .PERIOD 
That holds the long strand like this .PERIOD 
I wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye ,COMMA down the nose up the nose ,COMMA around the forehead ,COMMA back down and end in a little loop like this .PERIOD 
It's got a needle like a record needle ,COMMA that goes back and forth over the surface ,COMMA bumps up and down ,COMMA and feels the height of the first surface .PERIOD 
She wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of china ,COMMA which even has taiwan .PERIOD And you can see ,COMMA it's sort of on the world's shortest leash ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now this is just a single switch ,COMMA and you need half a billion for a computer .PERIOD So we have a long way to go .PERIOD 
The dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works .PERIOD 
The fact is that it does not scale .PERIOD 
So now we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna ,COMMA origami could otherwise .PERIOD 
You can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you'll get <NUM> rather than <NUM> .PERIOD 
Here is a dna ,COMMA origami rectangle ,COMMA and here are some tiles growing from it .PERIOD 
So it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant ,COMMA for how long it takes to do these kinds of things .PERIOD So i think we made a lot of progress .PERIOD 
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors .PERIOD 
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light ,COMMA asking new versions of those big questions ,COMMA and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Therefore it would be too risky to release these animals .PERIOD Both for the released .PERIOD And for the natural populations .PERIOD 
So this is not new .PERIOD People have been doing this around the world .PERIOD 
So these genes are indeed going back to the populations .PERIOD 
So i say ,COMMA let's study more ,COMMA let's shed light on this issue .PERIOD Let's do whatever we can .PERIOD 
This :COLON song kind of came out of all of that .PERIOD 
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported <NUM> victims ,COMMA saving life .PERIOD 
And the other is moksha-yug access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based ,COMMA microfinance .PERIOD 
Now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring .PERIOD 
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in .PERIOD That leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD 
Now let me ask you another question .PERIOD 
But you also don't have the time ,COMMA resources ,COMMA expertise or wherewithal to fight this .PERIOD 
Like a bribe buster service ,COMMA or 1-800-fight-bribes ,COMMA or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg .PERIOD 
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more .PERIOD 
A set of people actually say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them and run away from it .PERIOD 
But the one thing i want you to notice about them is this :COLON even though this is a very long list .PERIOD There isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like ,COMMA they encountered mike ,COMMA who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor ,COMMA because mr .PERIOD Jones was out of his bed ,COMMA getting a little exercise ,COMMA trying to build up his strength .PERIOD Walking slowly up and down the hall .PERIOD 
And then there was luke ,COMMA who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice ?QUESTIONMARK Because the man's father ,COMMA who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,COMMA didn't see luke ,COMMA do it the first time .PERIOD And his father was angry .PERIOD 
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to .PERIOD Every rule ,COMMA as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives .PERIOD 
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation .PERIOD And the people at hand .PERIOD 
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims .PERIOD 
Dad being an academic had no idea that mike's hard lemonade contained alcohol .PERIOD 
And they were ready to let the kid go .PERIOD 
When things go wrong as of course they do .PERIOD We reach for two tools to try to fix them .PERIOD 
Say ,COMMA <NUM> items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .PERIOD 
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD 
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD 
We need more rules for the bankers .PERIOD God knows .PERIOD 
Some ,COMMA psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA if we paid you six weeks' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community .PERIOD 
We see this in medicine .PERIOD 
I don't know how many of you remember this ,COMMA another moral hero .PERIOD <NUM> years ago .PERIOD Aaron feuerstein :COLON who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts -- they made polartec -- the factory burned down .PERIOD 
And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money .PERIOD 
In many ways ,COMMA this is the perfect example .PERIOD 
So there's a lot here at ted ,COMMA and at other places to celebrate .PERIOD 
There .PERIOD Are ordinary heroes .PERIOD 
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work .PERIOD 
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD 
I think there is reason for hope .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
A few years ago ,COMMA i was visited by the guy that runs darpa the people that fund all the advanced technologies ,COMMA that businesses and universities ,COMMA probably wouldn't take the risk of doing .PERIOD 
Now we've got f18s and f22s .PERIOD And if somebody loses an arm ,COMMA we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it .PERIOD 
If it's the raisin ,COMMA they won't drop it .PERIOD 
I told them they're nuts .PERIOD 
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful .PERIOD 
I went back and i started putting a team together the best guys i could find with a passion to do this .PERIOD 
We walked into walter reed .PERIOD And i could not have been more wrong .PERIOD 
I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears .PERIOD Or i can give you power .PERIOD I can't give you both .PERIOD 
I lost my right arm ,COMMA but i'm a lefty .PERIOD 
So we went back .PERIOD 
So we went back and we've been working harder yet .PERIOD 
And he was there and they said ,COMMA we needed to come .PERIOD 
He's got no arms .PERIOD 
Who is going to pay for it .PERIOD 
Those are tough questions .PERIOD 
I don't know the answers .PERIOD 
What do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK There's very polarized answers to that question too ,COMMA and i don't have any answers to that .PERIOD 
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary .PERIOD 
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be .PERIOD 
And we ought to give it to them .PERIOD 
That one was way more difficult than i had expected .PERIOD 
When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him .PERIOD And there was no brain damage .PERIOD 
So i took that as a challenge ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
And i stayed inside of that water tank ,COMMA hoping my core temperature would start to drop .PERIOD 
So i realized that was completely not going to work .PERIOD 
So i went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and i asked him ,COMMA how could i do that .PERIOD 
Then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing .PERIOD 
You blow in and out .PERIOD 
And you're really ridding your body of co2 .PERIOD 
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person .PERIOD 
I had to drop <NUM> pounds in three months .PERIOD 
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for ,COMMA its nutritional value .PERIOD 
And i started to really adapt my body .PERIOD 
I assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center .PERIOD And if i stayed there a week not eating ,COMMA i would get comfortable in that situation .PERIOD And i would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it .PERIOD 
And i thought everything seemed to be on track .PERIOD 
And by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD 
This was a different record .PERIOD This was a pure o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
But for tv they wanted me to be upright ,COMMA so they could see my face .PERIOD Basically .PERIOD 
That made me extremely nervous ,COMMA raising the heart rate .PERIOD 
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD 
And i started having ischemia to the heart .PERIOD 
My heartbeat would go from <NUM> to <NUM> to <NUM> to <NUM> to <NUM> to <NUM> again .PERIOD 
So i let my feet out .PERIOD And i started floating to the top .PERIOD 
They had doctors with the pst .PERIOD You know .PERIOD So sitting there waiting .PERIOD 
As a magician ,COMMA i try to show things to people that seem impossible .PERIOD 
And then he stopped walking in front of him ,COMMA was her .PERIOD 
Sure ,COMMA she had aged a little .PERIOD 
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him .PERIOD Because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD 
And that provides the ground for a type of action ,COMMA because consensus of each moment allows us to act .PERIOD 
We have three critical terms :COLON economy :COLON civil society and the state .PERIOD 
We propose <NUM> .PERIOD 
The least important form of capital in this project ,COMMA is financial capital -- money .PERIOD 
Now the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group -- is again ,COMMA it takes <NUM> years in your countries to produce somebody ,COMMA with a bs .PERIOD Degree .PERIOD 
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan ,COMMA it's because of that legacy .PERIOD 
Look ,COMMA there's a very little known fact .PERIOD Countries that have a legal average income per capita of <NUM> dollars ,COMMA don't produce drugs .PERIOD 
Cotton does not compete with opium .PERIOD A t-shirt does .PERIOD 
I'm all for it .PERIOD After all .PERIOD I raised a lot of it .PERIOD 
And then i'll let you in on a secret .PERIOD Which is why i am an incurable optimist .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's been calculated .PERIOD A few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps .PERIOD 
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,COMMA who are the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .PERIOD 
It will cause rising seas .PERIOD It will cause saline deposited into wells ,COMMA and into lands .PERIOD 
For some ,COMMA it will lead to anger ,COMMA religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .PERIOD 
A minimum of <NUM> to <NUM> inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for .PERIOD And it could be <NUM> times that .PERIOD 
Enough of the bad news .PERIOD Human beings have always risen to the challenge .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA there were three and a half million .PERIOD 
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
All throughout the technology world ,COMMA we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
More reasons to be optimistic in the '60s ,COMMA and i am a creature of the '60s .PERIOD There was a movement .PERIOD 
And on july 7th ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA i learned only yesterday .PERIOD There will be global live earth concerts .PERIOD 
Now that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest .PERIOD The most .PERIOD 
We visited every house in india ,COMMA searching for smallpox -- <NUM> million houses once every month ,COMMA for nearly two years .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
In the history of our planet ,COMMA there have been three great waves of evolution .PERIOD 
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way ,COMMA and then breeding them .PERIOD 
The scientists that made this cute little creature ,COMMA ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards .PERIOD 
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid ,COMMA created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .PERIOD 
They did it with puppies .PERIOD 
And so some states have decided to allow them .PERIOD Some states have decided to ban them .PERIOD 
And before you get too worried about it here in the united states ,COMMA the majority of food ,COMMA you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .PERIOD 
This is prometea ,COMMA the first cloned horse .PERIOD 
These were the first cloned calves ,COMMA the first cloned grey wolves .PERIOD And then finally ,COMMA the first cloned piglets :COLON alexis ,COMMA chista ,COMMA carrel ,COMMA janie and dotcom .PERIOD 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create .PERIOD 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA using a joystick ,COMMA they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right ,COMMA forwards ,COMMA or backwards .PERIOD 
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal .PERIOD 
And he used that as the it piece of a mechanism ,COMMA which ran a flight simulator .PERIOD 
I don't know ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding .PERIOD 
This is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts .PERIOD 
This is what frankenstein's lab looks like .PERIOD 
We are not only already using these things in animals .PERIOD Some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies .PERIOD 
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents .PERIOD 
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book ,COMMA on the origin of species published <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what is so interesting and to some the extent ,COMMA what's a bit infamous about the origin of species is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .PERIOD 
If only darwin had nasa .PERIOD 
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation .PERIOD 
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD 
So living at the equator ,COMMA we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful ,COMMA complex ,COMMA ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen .PERIOD 
Major moves outside of our equatorial homeland from africa into other parts of the old world .PERIOD And most recently into the new world .PERIOD 
But it's all uva .PERIOD And significantly ,COMMA that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin .PERIOD 
Humans have been on the move for a long time .PERIOD 
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people ,COMMA voluntary movements ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And not all these moves were voluntary .PERIOD 
Evolution .PERIOD Helps us .PERIOD 
But we need to think about how he compares ,COMMA in terms of his pigmentation ,COMMA to other people on earth .PERIOD 
They also run the risk of vitamin d deficiency .PERIOD If they have desk jobs ,COMMA like that guy .PERIOD 
Darwin ,COMMA i think would have appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the topic i'm going to discuss is one which is ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD Very peculiar .PERIOD Because it's very old .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA why do i show a cauliflower ,COMMA a very ordinary and ancient vegetable .PERIOD 
If you try to weigh it -- of course ,COMMA it's very easy to weigh it ,COMMA and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface .PERIOD 
If you cut ,COMMA with a sharp knife ,COMMA one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately .PERIOD You think of a whole cauliflower ,COMMA but smaller .PERIOD 
Now what did humanity do with that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA it's good in many ways .PERIOD 
It used to be very time-consuming ,COMMA but now it's nothing .PERIOD 
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .PERIOD 
This cloud is completely <NUM> percent artificial .PERIOD 
And the only part which is natural is a number ,COMMA the roughness of the cloud ,COMMA which is taken from nature .PERIOD 
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing ,COMMA that man can invent things that nature did not know .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane .PERIOD 
I read the book that mr .PERIOD Eiffel wrote about his tower .PERIOD And indeed ,COMMA it was astonishing how much he understood .PERIOD 
Then i was telling my assistant ,COMMA i don't see anything .PERIOD Can you paint it ?QUESTIONMARK 
It was very easy ,COMMA and you can write many books ,COMMA very fast about it .PERIOD 
In a way ,COMMA it's the story of my life .PERIOD 
If you could find something new ,COMMA anything you will get your career made .PERIOD 
It's so complicated .PERIOD 
Obviously ,COMMA from extraterrestrials .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity .PERIOD Nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth .PERIOD Ethiopia .PERIOD 
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north ,COMMA people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD 
Most africans today by far ,COMMA are farmers .PERIOD 
It also has very high cost ,COMMA implications .PERIOD 
Speaking of risk .PERIOD We have seen that price volatility of food .PERIOD Crops in africa is the highest in the world .PERIOD 
In the american midwest ,COMMA farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market .PERIOD 
What's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country using vsat technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .PERIOD 
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price ,COMMA premium .PERIOD 
We believe that the winds of change are here and that we can do it .PERIOD 
We believe that the stakes are high ,COMMA but that the returns will be even greater .PERIOD 
Ethiopia's agricultural market is <NUM> percent higher than south ,COMMA africa's grain production .PERIOD And in fact ,COMMA ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .PERIOD 
It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen and present my proposal to build a 6000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent .PERIOD 
The :COLON threat is desertification .PERIOD 
It is always the same .PERIOD Never the same endlessly fascinating .PERIOD 
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world .PERIOD Each second .PERIOD 
Just south of the sahara ,COMMA we find the sahel .PERIOD 
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees ,COMMA and hoping that they won't get chopped down .PERIOD 
Inside of the dunes ,COMMA we find shade .PERIOD 
Here i am playing the part of the mad scientist ,COMMA working with the bugs at ucl .PERIOD In london ,COMMA trying to solidify them .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i was inspired for my architectural form ,COMMA by tafoni ,COMMA which look a little bit like this .PERIOD This is a model representation of it .PERIOD 
These are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto .PERIOD 
That's not true at all .PERIOD 
So there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .PERIOD 
My design ,COMMA as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,COMMA is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .PERIOD 
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit .PERIOD 
He was talking about the space aliens .PERIOD 
I have never built an atomic pile .PERIOD 
Think about it .PERIOD 
I was pretty good at the video games .PERIOD I was not very good at the other part ,COMMA so i stayed alone with the cosmos .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans .PERIOD 
I went with my friend ,COMMA tim mcgonigal ,COMMA who sat on my left .PERIOD 
I remember ,COMMA she had some sort of injury to her ankle :COLON an ace bandage .PERIOD And she had crutches .PERIOD 
I was starting high school at the time .PERIOD I would say she was a junior ,COMMA but i had never seen her before .PERIOD She didn't go to my school .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA i liked him a lot better than the sandworms .PERIOD 
Except for the girl .PERIOD 
And the way i remember it :COLON the movie featured these details .PERIOD 
But i was exhausted and dog-bitten ,COMMA and so i said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes .PERIOD Either catherine would come back to the hotel ,COMMA or she would never come back to the hotel .PERIOD 
But he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA somebody pays you to go around and travel ,COMMA and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .PERIOD 
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past .PERIOD 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod .PERIOD 
It's a little hard to understand that ,COMMA because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish .PERIOD 
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it .PERIOD 
And people paid less in <NUM> dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little ,COMMA tiny fish .PERIOD 
You can see the rows in the bottom ,COMMA the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .PERIOD 
It was when i was on holiday last early autumn in france .PERIOD 
This is from the coast of brittany ,COMMA which is being enveloped in this green ,COMMA algal slime .PERIOD 
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously .PERIOD 
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries of the sardines of california or in peru ,COMMA or whatever those slow down and those fisheries collapse .PERIOD 
Now i haven't got anything against efficiency .PERIOD 
In the world i describe to you ,COMMA we have to be right over here at the right-hand side .PERIOD At six grams of carbon .PERIOD 
So i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics .PERIOD 
So it looks a little bit like this .PERIOD 
That's called the circular flow of the economy .PERIOD 
They want to hunker down .PERIOD They want to look to the future .PERIOD 
Are we these novelty-seeking ,COMMA hedonistic ,COMMA selfish individuals .PERIOD 
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human ,COMMA recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt's fragile altruist within .PERIOD 
And we're going to do it .PERIOD 
We're just going to click on naturejobsuk .PERIOD 
And this too requires investment investment -- for example ,COMMA in places -- places where we can connect ,COMMA places where we can participate ,COMMA shared spaces ,COMMA concert halls ,COMMA gardens ,COMMA public parks ,COMMA libraries ,COMMA museums ,COMMA quiet centers ,COMMA places of joy and celebration ,COMMA places of tranquility and contemplation ,COMMA sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship .PERIOD In michael ,COMMA sandel's lovely phrase .PERIOD 
Chris anderson :COLON while they're taking the podium away ,COMMA just a quick question .PERIOD 
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing .PERIOD 
But it has to have political leadership .PERIOD 
The napalm is burning there quite nicely .PERIOD 
Oil doesn't sink .PERIOD It floats .PERIOD 
And the other thing it does ,COMMA is it spreads out the moment it hits the water .PERIOD 
It triples the amount of oily ,COMMA messy goo that you have in the water .PERIOD And it makes it very hard to handle .PERIOD 
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics ,COMMA it's absolutely explosive .PERIOD 
They have a eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK Moment .PERIOD When we suddenly understand oil in a different context .PERIOD 
You might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this one ,COMMA are designed to look like atms .PERIOD 
Early journalists looked at these spills ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA this is a filthy industry .PERIOD 
And the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company ,COMMA a multinational .PERIOD 
And then there's this guy ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing .PERIOD 
They really influence people .PERIOD 
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period .PERIOD 
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms .PERIOD 
And these guys ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA if they were in the us ,COMMA they might be actually ,COMMA here in this room .PERIOD 
And then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay .PERIOD 
So what i'm going to talk to you about now is ,COMMA what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK 
We need to kind of ,COMMA get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel .PERIOD And these molecules .PERIOD 
Cynthia schneider ,COMMA these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD 
People become so engaged that they have volunteers ,COMMA just like political volunteers .PERIOD Anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside ,COMMA campaigning for their candidate .PERIOD 
One of them .PERIOD Lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country .PERIOD 
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD 
And then a thought came across my mind :COLON if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the himalayas .PERIOD 
I carried on for another five or six strokes ,COMMA and then i had nothing in my body .PERIOD And i went down to the bottom of the lake .PERIOD 
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .PERIOD 
And there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt .PERIOD Everest .PERIOD 
Take some time to rest and think about things .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA i do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this talk is going to be about ,COMMA how do we make things ,COMMA and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future .PERIOD 
And i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues .PERIOD I have and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it .PERIOD 
Literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program .PERIOD 
And this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology .PERIOD 
Took me six years at mit and about that many pages to describe what i was doing ,COMMA and it took him one page .PERIOD And so this is our muse tucker .PERIOD 
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins .PERIOD 
These are little mechanical computers .PERIOD 
These are five-state state .PERIOD Machines .PERIOD 
In a neutral state ,COMMA they won't bind at .PERIOD All .PERIOD 
So now i'm going to show you the hands-free ,COMMA autonomous self-replication .PERIOD 
So neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday ,COMMA i believe .PERIOD But i'll show you again .PERIOD 
And how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition .PERIOD 
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species .PERIOD 
And the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it .PERIOD 
And we're basically using mobility to get the access .PERIOD We need .PERIOD 
And it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us .PERIOD 
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth ,COMMA and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities .PERIOD 
Because right now ,COMMA our economy by and large operates as paul hawken .PERIOD Said by stealing the future selling it in the present and calling it gdp .PERIOD 
President clinton if you're here ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK No one really knows .PERIOD But i have read four explanations .PERIOD All of which ,COMMA i think ,COMMA have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD The first is ,COMMA maybe thomas hobbes ,COMMA got it right .PERIOD He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor ,COMMA nasty ,COMMA brutish and short ,COMMA not .PERIOD Because he argued humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative .PERIOD But because of the logic of anarchy ,COMMA in a state of anarchy ,COMMA there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,COMMA before they invade you more recently .PERIOD Thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement being .PERIOD A good american .PERIOD He has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun ,COMMA and walks down the stairs .PERIOD 
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible ,COMMA and therefore it would lead to a state of peace eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD 
This was an argument from the political scientist ,COMMA james payne .PERIOD 
Because we have been doing something right ,COMMA and it sure would be good to find out what it is .PERIOD 
We learned it in college .PERIOD 
We have liberia .PERIOD We have congo .PERIOD 
Income per person .PERIOD I can put that here .PERIOD 
That's why we are so scared about flu ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
And especially it's interesting to see china and the united states during <NUM> years ,COMMA because i have my oldest son now working for google after google ,COMMA acquired this software .PERIOD 
Mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china .PERIOD And then he died ,COMMA and then deng xiaoping started ,COMMA this amazing move forward .PERIOD 
And i come now into projections ,COMMA but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because -- that's where the projections are not valid .PERIOD Any longer .PERIOD 
East ,COMMA europe ,COMMA latin america and oecd countries .PERIOD 
It's lincoln here :COLON advancing them .PERIOD 
And we have countries all this way .PERIOD 
And what has happened in the world .PERIOD 
We used to boast about fast social progress .PERIOD 
That's where we were <NUM> .PERIOD 
And you can see it's not that easy that it is war ,COMMA which caused this .PERIOD 
And here in zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD 
If i split tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer <NUM> percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one .PERIOD 
And it's really different within each country .PERIOD 
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi .PERIOD In the '30s .PERIOD 
We have seen it here in mozambique .PERIOD 
That used to be the illegal diamond trade from the unita-dominated area .PERIOD In angola .PERIOD 
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies ,COMMA and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries .PERIOD 
I am a reformed marketer ,COMMA and i now work in international development .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA there's just not in demand .PERIOD 
And as a marketer ,COMMA i found that curious .PERIOD 
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms .PERIOD Fear ,COMMA financing and fidelity .PERIOD 
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them ,COMMA show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD 
And so the lesson is this :COLON it doesn't really matter what you're selling .PERIOD You just have to think about who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .PERIOD 
It was before the avian flu had reached europe .PERIOD 
I'll see what i can do ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Generations ,COMMA go by somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick .PERIOD 
Just absolutely delights the little ones .PERIOD 
Point is there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD 
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics .PERIOD And so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way .PERIOD Because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD Well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat .PERIOD 
I have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now ,COMMA because i don't think that's going to be enough anyway .PERIOD Although it's essential .PERIOD 
That is to say -- -- thank you .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD That is to say ,COMMA remember ,COMMA my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest .PERIOD 
Doing the best i can ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
It was kind of along these lines .PERIOD And the allegation was that i have ,COMMA quote ,COMMA affection for terrorists .PERIOD 
And a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of ,COMMA literally saves the world .PERIOD 
Yahweh is our savior means he has saved the nation of israel ,COMMA which ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA was a pretty high-level social organization .PERIOD 
I am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes ,COMMA and they're reflecting on my glasses .PERIOD 
Because despair ,COMMA civil war hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our african reality ,COMMA they are not the only reality .PERIOD 
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship .PERIOD 
Support ,COMMA private investment ,COMMA in africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign .PERIOD 
Which country is that .PERIOD 
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy .PERIOD It lies with international donors .PERIOD 
The imf ,COMMA the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world ,COMMA has taken over our rights as citizens ,COMMA and therefore what our governments are doing .PERIOD Because they depend on aid ,COMMA is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens .PERIOD 
They talk to international donors .PERIOD 
Where has all the aid gone .PERIOD 
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do i mean .PERIOD 
The editor of discover told us ,COMMA <NUM> of them .PERIOD I'm going to give you the eleventh .PERIOD 
So they came to me -- cnn -- and they said ,COMMA professor seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look !EXCLAMATIONMARK Doctor seligman ,COMMA we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium .PERIOD 
Not good enough ,COMMA and that's what i'm going to be talking about .PERIOD 
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .PERIOD 
And starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy .PERIOD People .PERIOD 
That's what aristotle was talking about .PERIOD 
The first life is the pleasant life ,COMMA and it's simply ,COMMA as best we can find it .PERIOD It's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion as you can ,COMMA and learning the skills -- savoring ,COMMA mindfulness -- that amplify them ,COMMA that stretch them over time and space .PERIOD 
In two of the three great arenas of life .PERIOD By the time ,COMMA len was <NUM> ,COMMA len ,COMMA was enormously successful .PERIOD The first arena was work .PERIOD 
It turned out that -- len grew up in long island ,COMMA and he played football ,COMMA and watched football ,COMMA and played bridge -- len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .PERIOD 
When he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at <NUM> in the morning ,COMMA time stops for him ,COMMA and it stops till the closing bell .PERIOD 
And we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are .PERIOD 
Just one example .PERIOD One person i worked with was a bagger at genuardi's .PERIOD 
Her highest strength was social intelligence ,COMMA so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her .PERIOD The social highlight of every customer's day .PERIOD 
Now obviously she failed .PERIOD 
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .PERIOD 
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked .PERIOD 
I hope all of you have such a person .PERIOD 
But they were empty .PERIOD 
And so the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA i believe .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism .PERIOD In addition to the space elevator ,COMMA is that i think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .PERIOD 
And if technology can ,COMMA in the next decade or two ,COMMA increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD 
Here's an example .PERIOD 
Four years ago ,COMMA i was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches .PERIOD 
So this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists ,COMMA working at the very top of their craft -- except one .PERIOD 
But to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you .PERIOD 
But the centerpiece species of zakouma are the elephants .PERIOD 
And instead ,COMMA created a story that touched our audiences deeply .PERIOD 
Instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts .PERIOD 
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned .PERIOD 
We also want to look for solutions .PERIOD 
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply .PERIOD 
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And my father was a soldier ,COMMA and my uncle was a fisherman ,COMMA and also a poacher .PERIOD 
For three times ,COMMA i applied to biomedical science ,COMMA to be a doctor .PERIOD 
With the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu sese seko that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD 
So they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD 
All my friends said ,COMMA we are leaving because we are a target .PERIOD 
But i'm not going to the east because i don't know ,COMMA swahili .PERIOD 
Because he's pygmy .PERIOD He knows how to track elephants in the forest .PERIOD 
They came to told me ,COMMA i have to save him .PERIOD 
Everywhere ,COMMA there has been constant extraction of ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers and so on .PERIOD 
That is coltan extraction ,COMMA gold mining .PERIOD 
We have to do it because to let our movement advance .PERIOD 
After a week ,COMMA we celebrated the birthday of that ,COMMA okapi .PERIOD They killed an elephant ,COMMA just <NUM> meters to the area where the zoo ,COMMA where okapi was born .PERIOD 
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants .PERIOD 
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game .PERIOD 
And they can't go even to university .PERIOD 
Thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real digital human face .PERIOD 
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that ,COMMA unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,COMMA we look at human faces every day .PERIOD 
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds .PERIOD 
If we zoom in on this photograph right here ,COMMA we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her ,COMMA because she is lit from absolutely everywhere .PERIOD At the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture .PERIOD 
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here .PERIOD 
And thank you very much .PERIOD 
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point .PERIOD 
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places .PERIOD 
Next year ,COMMA i'll be leading an international team to j2 .PERIOD 
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .PERIOD 
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo .PERIOD 
One !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is :COLON how ?QUESTIONMARK Do you do science autonomy underground .PERIOD 
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field ?QUESTIONMARK Microbiologist .PERIOD 
If it passes the microscopic test we go for a collection .PERIOD 
No hands at the wheel .PERIOD 
This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own .PERIOD 
That's more than you pay for ted .PERIOD If google dropped their sponsorship .PERIOD 
There is a place where you can .PERIOD 
If we're going to get that and make that gas station possible ,COMMA we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .PERIOD 
It has never been done .PERIOD 
I like this equipment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i really value it .PERIOD So we're not going to burn the gear .PERIOD 
And i'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within .PERIOD And to follow the ted commandments :COLON that is ,COMMA actually something that creates a near-death experience ,COMMA but near-death is good for creativity .PERIOD 
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis .PERIOD You know ,COMMA who am i ?QUESTIONMARK Why am i this particular person ?QUESTIONMARK Why am i not black like everybody else .PERIOD 
I used to draw .PERIOD I thought i would be an artist .PERIOD 
And when you are faced with the prospect of death ,COMMA very soon ,COMMA you begin to think very much about everything .PERIOD 
So in quantum mechanics ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you have dark energy and dark matter .PERIOD 
And that's what i look for in my work ,COMMA a personal meaning .PERIOD 
And they also have to make a living ,COMMA and people need to be fed .PERIOD 
It may be something that is ,COMMA perhaps more serious -- as i said ,COMMA human rights in burma .PERIOD 
This leads to this question .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA i was writing a story that included some kind of detail ,COMMA period of history ,COMMA a certain location .PERIOD 
Especially when good things happen ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA when bad things happen .PERIOD 
But i do think there's a kind of serendipity ,COMMA and i do want to know what those elements are ,COMMA so i can thank them ,COMMA and also try to find them in my life .PERIOD 
Is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things .PERIOD 
It takes a while ,COMMA but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there .PERIOD 
And the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread .PERIOD No one wanted it .PERIOD 
And when i talk about it ,COMMA i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation .PERIOD And because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this tv-industrial complex ,COMMA informed my entire childhood ,COMMA and probably yours .PERIOD 
And i ignored every message because i don't have a pain reliever problem .PERIOD 
I buy the stuff in the yellow box ,COMMA because i always have .PERIOD 
Consumers don't care about you at all ;SEMICOLON they just don't care .PERIOD 
Because people saw it and said -- i didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA people in the fashion business ,COMMA know ,COMMA what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it .PERIOD 
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .PERIOD 
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads ,COMMA or insisting on meetings with people .PERIOD 
He lived in paris last year .PERIOD He sold <NUM> million dollars' worth of french bread .PERIOD 
It was neat ;SEMICOLON it was remarkable ,COMMA and slowly it spread from one person to another person .PERIOD Until finally ,COMMA it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in paris .PERIOD 
They would ignore the geeks ,COMMA and ,COMMA god forbid ,COMMA the laggards .PERIOD 
To make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that .PERIOD Doesn't have a constituency with an otaku ,COMMA is almost impossible .PERIOD 
Krispy kreme has a strategy .PERIOD And what they do is they enter a city .PERIOD They talk to the people with otaku ,COMMA and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street .PERIOD 
They're made from cremains .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA you like my ring ,COMMA it's my grandmother .PERIOD 
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .PERIOD 
The first one is :COLON design is free .PERIOD When you get to scale .PERIOD 
And the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .PERIOD 
Silk ,COMMA put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section .PERIOD 
For the people who were there ,COMMA and looking at that section ,COMMA it was remarkable .PERIOD 
And i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things i was seeing underwater ,COMMA incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .PERIOD 
And the ice that is there is quite thin .PERIOD 
These are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks .PERIOD 
But the truth is ,COMMA we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD 
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and <NUM> pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .PERIOD 
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth ,COMMA we're killing over <NUM> million sharks every single year .PERIOD 
But before i went out to photograph this component ,COMMA i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark .PERIOD That will resonate with readers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .PERIOD 
One of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas ,COMMA where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .PERIOD 
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much ,COMMA until maybe about seven or <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
But this is crucial habitat .PERIOD And it's where they spend the first two three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD 
I actually jumped in and photographed this .PERIOD And with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA i cut the turtle out .PERIOD And it was able to swim free .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate ,COMMA and the species' future is in great danger .PERIOD 
You can see the coal burning plant in the background .PERIOD 
I went down there in the winter time .PERIOD 
And these are animals that had never seen humans before .PERIOD And i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return .PERIOD Because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .PERIOD 
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population ,COMMA low and behold ,COMMA kelp forests emerged in shallow water .PERIOD 
And that's because the urchins eat kelp .PERIOD 
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .PERIOD 
The ocean is indeed resilient and tolerant to a point .PERIOD But we must be good custodians .PERIOD 
But i'm moving past malthus because i think that we just might be about <NUM> years from a kind of new enlightenment .PERIOD 
And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than <NUM> billion late this century .PERIOD 
But look what happened in europe after the plague ,COMMA rising wages ,COMMA land reform ,COMMA technological innovation ,COMMA birth of the middle class ,COMMA and after that ,COMMA forward-looking social movements like the renaissance ,COMMA and later ,COMMA the enlightenment .PERIOD 
Because transitions are dangerous times .PERIOD 
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions .PERIOD 
I was walking in the market one day with my wife .PERIOD And somebody stuck a cage in my face .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're in east borneo .PERIOD This is the place where i started .PERIOD 
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation ,COMMA where you have nothing to a target situation .PERIOD 
And once the soil gets dried ,COMMA you're in a dry season -- you get cracks ,COMMA oxygen goes in ,COMMA flames come out .PERIOD And the problem starts all over again .PERIOD 
This is what it looked like for three months .PERIOD 
We lost all the crops .PERIOD No children gained weight for over a year .PERIOD They lost <NUM> iq .PERIOD Points .PERIOD It was a disaster for orangutans .PERIOD And people .PERIOD 
That was why i put it as a single point up .PERIOD There .PERIOD 
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen ,COMMA and without those microorganisms ,COMMA you won't have any performance at all .PERIOD 
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space .PERIOD 
In the beginning ,COMMA maybe pineapples and beans and corn .PERIOD In the second phase ,COMMA there will be bananas and papayas .PERIOD Later on ,COMMA there will be chocolate and chilies .PERIOD 
And that's green .PERIOD If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass .PERIOD 
Air !EXCLAMATIONMARK Humidity is up .PERIOD <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Each of the families that have sold their land .PERIOD Now get a piece of land back .PERIOD

In north ,COMMA sulawesi ,COMMA it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there .PERIOD So there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .PERIOD 
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project .PERIOD 
Now i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer ,COMMA is integration .PERIOD

It means challenging what we take for granted ,COMMA things that we think are obvious .PERIOD 
He said this in december <NUM> to the second annual meeting of congress .PERIOD

I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA i'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics .PERIOD 
Let me show you what these people do .PERIOD 
We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery .PERIOD So i designed this thing .PERIOD 
So he jumped in the van ,COMMA he went to miss jones' house and said ,COMMA miss jones .PERIOD I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening ,COMMA but you probably didn't have a ride .PERIOD 
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i work for a company called hewlett-packard .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's an easy solution to that problem .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA because i heard you built the center and i didn't believe that you did it .PERIOD And i wanted to see for myself .PERIOD 
Well we did win .PERIOD And our name was literally in lights over madison square garden .PERIOD 
And that was our first recording studio ,COMMA which was the broom closet .PERIOD 
And this is what i want to do when i grow up .PERIOD 
This is in a place called san francisco .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA herbie ,COMMA this is my concept of a training center for poor people .PERIOD 
And now i really want to build one .PERIOD 
And i promised these people that i was going to build this thing ,COMMA and we're going to build it all right .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA if i can follow that music ,COMMA i'll get out into the sunlight and i'll be ok .PERIOD 
And i don't think i'm crazy .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .PERIOD 
At the best ,COMMA you're <NUM> percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like .PERIOD 
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live .PERIOD 
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium .PERIOD That comes from the ocean named vibrio fischeri .PERIOD 
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room ,COMMA and this is what we see .PERIOD 
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .PERIOD 
The question that we had is how can bacteria ,COMMA these primitive organisms ,COMMA tell the difference from times when they're alone ,COMMA and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together .PERIOD 
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .PERIOD 
And then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment .PERIOD So there's lots of molecule there .PERIOD 
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD 
This is the vibrio fischeri molecule .PERIOD 
So then we started to look at other bacteria ,COMMA and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered .PERIOD 
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .PERIOD 
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .PERIOD 
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .PERIOD 
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule ,COMMA that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings .PERIOD 
Anywhere on your body ,COMMA it looks pretty much like this .PERIOD And what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there .PERIOD 
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics .PERIOD 
And so now of course ,COMMA we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD 
The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD 
I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .PERIOD 
This is exactly what happens in your body .PERIOD 
But then to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth ,COMMA we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD 
Remember you have these <NUM> times or more bacterial cells in you or on you keeping you healthy .PERIOD 
So i'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician .PERIOD But in the last year and a half ,COMMA i've started to switch over to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices .PERIOD And what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .PERIOD 
It's really our first foray into this .PERIOD 
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face ,COMMA and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face ,COMMA and if it got a different pattern ,COMMA it would know that what was out there was say ,COMMA a dog ,COMMA or another pattern would be a house .PERIOD 
So this is what we've been working on .PERIOD And this is what our prosthetic does .PERIOD 
So a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all ,COMMA no photoreceptors ,COMMA can now send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand .PERIOD 
And so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire .PERIOD They just don't fire in the normal firing patterns .PERIOD Because they don't have the right code .PERIOD 
This is just actually the first one that we tried .PERIOD 
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device .PERIOD Here ,COMMA we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood and be understood by the brain .PERIOD 
You can just call it out .PERIOD 
Who else .PERIOD 
The worst flute players .PERIOD 
Actually that was aristotle's answer too .PERIOD 
Peter ;SEMICOLON the greatest benefit to all .PERIOD 
The greatest benefit to all .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD 
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD 
And the point ,COMMA the essential nature of musical performance ,COMMA is to produce excellent music .PERIOD 
Suppose you were on the supreme court .PERIOD 
Suppose ,COMMA you were deciding the justice of this case .PERIOD 
Raise your hand ,COMMA and we'll try to get you a microphone .PERIOD 
That's part of the game of golf .PERIOD 
Charlie ,COMMA what do you say to warren .PERIOD 
Warren ,COMMA i am not a golfer .PERIOD 
He wouldn't have granted the cart .PERIOD And he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD 
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement ,COMMA that is what distinguishes games from productive activity .PERIOD It is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential .PERIOD 
First :COLON no ,COMMA real sports fan would talk that way .PERIOD 
On the face of it ,COMMA it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument ,COMMA about fairness .PERIOD What's an unfair advantage .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats .PERIOD The status that we confer ,COMMA the honor and recognition .PERIOD That goes to truly great athletes .PERIOD 
How many here favor the first policy ?QUESTIONMARK The state should recognize traditional marriage ,COMMA only .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,COMMA and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .PERIOD 
That was easy ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok ?QUESTIONMARK Hands up .PERIOD Anyone in the audience ,COMMA who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing ,COMMA or a bad thing .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city boys have no business telling us rural types .PERIOD What to do with our time ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's a global trance .PERIOD 
But the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging ,COMMA as it is .PERIOD 
People worry about overpopulation .PERIOD They say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of .PERIOD Or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st .PERIOD Giles carelessly .PERIOD 
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .PERIOD 
But it isn't .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live ,COMMA in terms of remaining life expectancy ,COMMA as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .PERIOD 
But if you're only <NUM> ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and ,COMMA you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental .PERIOD And in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .PERIOD 
And that's quite a thought .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies .PERIOD 
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes .PERIOD And of course ,COMMA that has enormous implications .PERIOD 
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology ,COMMA the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life .PERIOD Starting before we're born .PERIOD 
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago ,COMMA and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these <NUM> years ,COMMA so the fact that we haven't extended this list ,COMMA is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD 
And you know what happened .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq .PERIOD 
And i think we know how to do it ,COMMA and i'll stop there .PERIOD 
Audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases .PERIOD So that individuals live long enough to procreate .PERIOD 
If i project that that would make me think that i would live until <NUM> if i don't crash on my motorbike .PERIOD 
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve .PERIOD 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends ,COMMA including president obama .PERIOD 
I'm here to tell you the story of audur capital ,COMMA which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of <NUM> ,COMMA just over a year before the economic collapse hit .PERIOD 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence .PERIOD 
So we like to see profits ,COMMA plus positive social and environmental benefits .PERIOD When we invest .PERIOD 
Now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables .PERIOD Will we see business and finance change .PERIOD 
I want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and i remain hopeful .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA it was the start of a long journey .PERIOD But i decided that day to matter .PERIOD 
External debt -- something that i can tell you a long story about ,COMMA because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .PERIOD 
Because we are confronted with a challenge .PERIOD 
We need to bring it back to say ,COMMA what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want .PERIOD 
And i want to tell you something .PERIOD 
The issue is not that .PERIOD 
She was three years old ,COMMA and i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked <NUM> kilometers with her strapped on my back .PERIOD 
In about two to three hours ,COMMA she started to move .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we have to use it well .PERIOD 
For which many people ,COMMA even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs .PERIOD 
They are just discovering .PERIOD 
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go .PERIOD 
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations ,COMMA with the international organizations and with our private sector .PERIOD 
Aid cannot solve our problems .PERIOD I'm firmly convinced about that .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the chinese minister of finance said to me ,COMMA when i asked him ,COMMA what are we doing wrong in nigeria .PERIOD 
Infrastructure infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline .PERIOD 
And i repeat it for the continent .PERIOD 
And lastly ,COMMA what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid ,COMMA government ,COMMA private sector and the african as an individual .PERIOD 
I will say ,COMMA though that ,COMMA after having done surgery ,COMMA a lot it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument .PERIOD 
And i'll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,COMMA they're very dense .PERIOD And when you actually go through them ,COMMA it's very hard to recognize the music in it .PERIOD 
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change .PERIOD In concentration .PERIOD 
Charles limb .PERIOD This is a plastic midi piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD 
And so what we did was ,COMMA we brought professional jazz players to the nih .PERIOD And we had them memorize this piece of music on the left .PERIOD The lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .PERIOD 
And i've listened to that solo <NUM> times and i still like it .PERIOD 
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD 
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity ,COMMA and i'll summarize that for you here .PERIOD 
Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain .PERIOD 
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you study rap scientifically .PERIOD 
With this big screen ,COMMA you can all rap with me .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
He's just memorized a rhyme for us .PERIOD 
And what we see ,COMMA we do see ,COMMA language areas lighting up .PERIOD But then -- eyes closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up .PERIOD 
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task .PERIOD When that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA don't get me wrong .PERIOD Calculus is an important subject .PERIOD 
And every student who studies math ,COMMA science ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA economics ,COMMA they should definitely learn calculus by the end ,COMMA of their freshman year ,COMMA of college .PERIOD 
It's understanding data .PERIOD 
Look the world has changed from analog to digital .PERIOD 
The majority of our functional brain ,COMMA is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity .PERIOD The brain surface is highly folded .PERIOD 
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex ,COMMA so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD 
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .PERIOD 
With neutral ,COMMA there's nothing in particular that .PERIOD Evan needs to do .PERIOD 
It takes eight seconds to do this .PERIOD And now that that's done ,COMMA we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA evan ,COMMA choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD 
So the idea here now is that ,COMMA evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen ,COMMA and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that .PERIOD 
The first time ,COMMA nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull .PERIOD 
So one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three go .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD 
Ah ?QUESTIONMARK Good job .PERIOD 
That's really amazing .PERIOD 
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions ,COMMA we do that all the time .PERIOD So you can visualize it .PERIOD 
So i'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface .PERIOD 
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD 
We could spend hours going over this .PERIOD 
It creates a very high peak power .PERIOD And it lets you do all kinds of interesting things .PERIOD In particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin .PERIOD 
And using both this technique and other optical techniques ,COMMA we think we can make those diagnostics .PERIOD 
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria ,COMMA a way ,COMMA in acute cases ,COMMA to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD 
You can give drug administration .PERIOD 
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data .PERIOD 
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD 
So that sets the stage on which you do this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA there were <NUM> cases a year of malaria in the united states ,COMMA but ddt ,COMMA and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON yeah .PERIOD 
Nathan myhrvold okay ,COMMA so our legal department prepared a disclaimer ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA after thinking about this a little bit ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser .PERIOD 
We have the device over here .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine .PERIOD And let me show you how it works .PERIOD 
This is very satisfying .PERIOD 
It grows and is nurtured .PERIOD 
Basically a restaurant ,COMMA just like any other .PERIOD 
Chairs :COLON recycled and recyclable .PERIOD 
I was experimenting with these -- i don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there .PERIOD 
This is the kitchen ,COMMA which is in the same room .PERIOD 
Rather than me putting a dish down ,COMMA they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .PERIOD 
This is the waste room .PERIOD 
In here ,COMMA i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable .PERIOD 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism .PERIOD It's turning through these amazing sails on the roof .PERIOD And that in turn ,COMMA is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them ,COMMA or heating them ,COMMA as the need may be .PERIOD 
In the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant .PERIOD There is hundreds of meters of coil .PERIOD Piping .PERIOD 
He's growing all his own fruit ,COMMA and that's fantastic .PERIOD 
So you've got to watch your space for that .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so this is my next project .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable .PERIOD 
And no one's doing that ,COMMA just yet .PERIOD 
This is a herd .PERIOD And it is built according to genetical codes .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel .PERIOD Because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do .PERIOD 
Ok ?QUESTIONMARK Good .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here .PERIOD And it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD So it's very simple brain .PERIOD 
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal .PERIOD 
We did haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,COMMA that of mycoplasma genitalium .PERIOD 
In <NUM> :COLON we published our first success .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA ham smith ,COMMA and clyde hutchison developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level .PERIOD 
And we can walk through the reasons for that .PERIOD But basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from .PERIOD Whereas the larger ,COMMA faster-growing cell takes only two days .PERIOD 
It's an amazing step forward .PERIOD But we had a problem ,COMMA because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD 
And we thought ,COMMA this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .PERIOD 
We narrowed it down to one fragment ;SEMICOLON we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene .PERIOD 
We got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic .PERIOD 
It's significant to us .PERIOD 
So when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process quite substantially .PERIOD 
You may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being <NUM> virgins .PERIOD And i promise i will come back to those virgins .PERIOD 
It's just <NUM> words in arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA in translation .PERIOD 
But all is not lost in translation .PERIOD 
And that number <NUM> ,COMMA never appears .PERIOD 
There are no <NUM> virgins .PERIOD In the koran .PERIOD 
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens .PERIOD And then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers .PERIOD 
Here's my study site :COLON this is really a picture of ants .PERIOD And the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD 
Ants never make more ants .PERIOD Colonies make more colonies .PERIOD 
And this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD Here's her wings .PERIOD 
She lays eggs ,COMMA she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg .PERIOD Then it's a larva .PERIOD 
So things happen to an ant colony .PERIOD 
When it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert .PERIOD 
And that's the process that i call task allocation .PERIOD 
That is that there are chambers inside ,COMMA they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA an ant starts out somewhere near the queen .PERIOD 
The queen's in there somewhere .PERIOD She just lays eggs .PERIOD 
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do .PERIOD There is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest .PERIOD 
We started out with model airplane paint ,COMMA and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA just to summarize the result .PERIOD Well ,COMMA it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent .PERIOD 
And the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people ,COMMA was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD 
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD 
This process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD 
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks ,COMMA in deciding what to do .PERIOD 
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,COMMA and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD 
So i want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out first of all ,COMMA showing you the nest entrance .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD It's down inside the nest .PERIOD 
Each ant :COLON then ,COMMA as it comes back in ,COMMA is contacting other ants .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what's interesting about this system is that it's messy .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA i don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .PERIOD 
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero this internet of devices .PERIOD 
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully .PERIOD This is a raw material .PERIOD 
This was just a proof of principle .PERIOD He did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein folding ,COMMA that specifies their structure .PERIOD 
But i had a problem .PERIOD Once i had all these machines ,COMMA i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .PERIOD 
When a user screams into scream buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced .PERIOD 
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll ;SEMICOLON dec is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it .PERIOD 
And the way you close ,COMMA it is not it for the masses ,COMMA but it development for the masses .PERIOD 
You can see it in their face .PERIOD Just this joy of i can do it .PERIOD 
We designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab .PERIOD 
This is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> o'clock at night .PERIOD And i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked .PERIOD The first time .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD 
And then in turn ,COMMA businesses started to grow ,COMMA like making these antennas .PERIOD 
We're learning more from them than we're giving them .PERIOD 
I was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it .PERIOD 
Real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD 
Pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers .PERIOD 
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains ,COMMA but it outgrew it .PERIOD So they built this extraordinary village for the lab .PERIOD 
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems .PERIOD 
The message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks .PERIOD They're sources .PERIOD 
That has got to be stopped .PERIOD 
Somehow that doesn't seem right .PERIOD 
So here we are using <NUM> million barrels a day -- producing eight ,COMMA importing <NUM> and from the <NUM> .PERIOD Five comes from opec .PERIOD 
Now i had people in washington last week told me .PERIOD He said ,COMMA the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel .PERIOD 
We're headed to natural gas .PERIOD 
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it .PERIOD 
Natural gas will fit all of those .PERIOD 
It will replace ,COMMA or be able to be used for that .PERIOD 
So i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .PERIOD 
And where i've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks .PERIOD 
There are eight million of them .PERIOD 
I'm back to theorist again .PERIOD 
So there's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan other than i'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
That'll make you abandon something .PERIOD 
I'm a geologist ,COMMA got out of school in '<NUM> .PERIOD And i've been in the industry ,COMMA my entire life .PERIOD 
I'm not a big natural gas producer .PERIOD 
You've made the money you need .PERIOD 
Does that make sense .PERIOD 
The government is not successful on these things .PERIOD 
But chris ,COMMA i think where we're headed the long-term ,COMMA i don't mind going back to nuclear .PERIOD 
There isn't anything wrong with nuke .PERIOD 
Tbp :COLON fracking what is fracking .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking .PERIOD 
The first frack job was in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
There's no problems .PERIOD 
If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution .PERIOD Are you ready to invest in those technologies ?QUESTIONMARK Even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet .PERIOD 
When you think about resilience and technology ,COMMA it's actually much easier .PERIOD 
The internet was also very real .PERIOD This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD It's a big deal .PERIOD 
People on the east coast in <NUM> .PERIOD When they first started to get the news ,COMMA they thought ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD 
You had dotcom fever ,COMMA and you had gold fever .PERIOD 
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go .PERIOD Look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back .PERIOD 
They had bad burn rate in the gold rush ,COMMA a very bad burn rate .PERIOD 
This is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year <NUM> .PERIOD 
Bride #1 :COLON you said ,COMMA you had a large selection of invitations .PERIOD Clerk :COLON but we do .PERIOD 
Husband #2 :COLON not for another <NUM> minutes .PERIOD Announcer :COLON after all ,COMMA it's your special day .PERIOD 
Ourbeginningcom life's an event ;SEMICOLON announce it to the world .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic .PERIOD And that analogy is the electric industry .PERIOD 
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out .PERIOD 
Well it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down .PERIOD 
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD 
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning .PERIOD 
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .PERIOD 
Because you know ,COMMA resilience -- if you think of it ,COMMA in terms of the gold rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed right now .PERIOD Because the last nugget of gold would be gone .PERIOD 
She -- but you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very ,COMMA very beginning .PERIOD If you believe it's the <NUM> hurley washing machine .PERIOD Then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD And i do think that that's where we are .PERIOD 
The golden rule is great .PERIOD I'm a big supporter of both .PERIOD 
In the beginning ,COMMA there was compassion .PERIOD And i mean ,COMMA not just when human beings first showed up ,COMMA but actually even before that .PERIOD 
I warned you ,COMMA this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .PERIOD 
Now there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports :COLON where there's a winner and a loser .PERIOD 
Either way your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD That's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you .PERIOD Because every point is either good for both of you -- positive ,COMMA win-win -- or bad for both of you .PERIOD It's lose-lose .PERIOD 
The deployment of the golden rule .PERIOD Most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels .PERIOD 
With zero-sum channels ,COMMA you would expect something else .PERIOD 
But it may ,COMMA and the good news is that history has naturally expanded .PERIOD These webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion .PERIOD 
That's the story of civilization .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD 
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships ,COMMA economic engagement is generally better than blockades .PERIOD And so on in this regard .PERIOD

So here we're looking from the south look north .PERIOD 
Over on the eastern side it's gentle .PERIOD As you can see .PERIOD 
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like .PERIOD 
Another is the experience in the mountain .PERIOD

One of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently .PERIOD 
To go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism .PERIOD

We thought of people as a liability .PERIOD 
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy .PERIOD

There were three other expeditions on the mountain ,COMMA an american team ,COMMA a new zealand team and an imax team .PERIOD 
And from there we climb up to camp two ,COMMA which is sort of the foreground .PERIOD 
If you notice ,COMMA the summit of everest is black .PERIOD 
This is not good weather to climb in .PERIOD So the climbers are just waiting ,COMMA hoping that the wind's going to die down .PERIOD 
The summit would be in the foreground .PERIOD 
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly ,COMMA and unexpectedly picked up .PERIOD

Ok ,COMMA this is a view taken on the summit ridge ,COMMA itself .PERIOD 
But either way you fall for the rest of your life .PERIOD

We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we were there for an hour talking .PERIOD 
And it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with which is i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war ,COMMA and about politics .PERIOD 
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation .PERIOD 
It was mass casualties .PERIOD 
This is blood .PERIOD 
Five .PERIOD Soldiers filmed the entire time .PERIOD

I get -- i'm often asked ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film .PERIOD 
And he looked at me and i smiled .PERIOD And then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .PERIOD 
So when i talk about a disconnect ,COMMA it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier ,COMMA which there obviously are .PERIOD You know ,COMMA these days it's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front .PERIOD And everybody seemed involved .PERIOD

We must change everything .PERIOD 
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound .PERIOD 
And i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .PERIOD 
It is transparent ,COMMA made just for you .PERIOD 
This is a setup i put in a physics lab .PERIOD 
We need to reach a target inside the brain .PERIOD 
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain ,COMMA noninvasively ,COMMA with focused ultrasound in the '50s .PERIOD 
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .PERIOD 
They were missing the vision .PERIOD 
It is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD 
We attach a transducer ,COMMA in this case to the brain .PERIOD But if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD 
It's a target in the thalamus .PERIOD 
It doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .PERIOD 
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD 
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,COMMA then we move to perform a full-energy ablation .PERIOD Like you see here .PERIOD 
And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk .PERIOD 
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD 
I don't see without this nation ,COMMA taking it as some collective will ,COMMA or something .PERIOD That is a national goal to make that happen .PERIOD It will not happen .PERIOD 
And it's not just because of regulation ;SEMICOLON it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .PERIOD 
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .PERIOD 
Women suffer from that disease .PERIOD 
In the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection .PERIOD 
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs because they can't knock off the logo .PERIOD

Our leaders and ourselves want everything .PERIOD But we don't talk about the costs .PERIOD

Robert kennedy once said that few of us have the greatness to bend history itself ,COMMA but each of us can work to change a small portion of events .PERIOD 
But we do not know his face .PERIOD

I said ,COMMA if i can't get the craft that i want ,COMMA i'll use the craft .PERIOD I can get .PERIOD 
And it was all of one material .PERIOD And the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .PERIOD 
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers' unions of america and canada in washington .PERIOD And i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- a little shopping center .PERIOD 
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .PERIOD 
When you have to do something really cheaply ,COMMA it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff .PERIOD 
He didn't recommend me by the way .PERIOD 
I keep trying to make it work .PERIOD 
It's never been finished .PERIOD 
This is the city hall over here somewhere ,COMMA and the courthouse .PERIOD 
Sohio is on the axis here ,COMMA and we followed the axis ,COMMA and they're two kind of goalposts .PERIOD 
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .PERIOD 
And following that basic idea of the village ,COMMA we changed it as we got into it .PERIOD 
That's the living room .PERIOD 
You come down from this level along the stairway ,COMMA and you enter the bedroom .PERIOD Here ,COMMA going into the lake .PERIOD 
These stonehenge things were designed to give foreground ,COMMA and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .PERIOD 
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it .PERIOD 
Jay chiat is a glutton for punishment .PERIOD And he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons .PERIOD 
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall ,COMMA with a rodeo and restaurants .PERIOD 
It has a chamber hall .PERIOD 
There's commercial at the ground floor .PERIOD 
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria ,COMMA which led to this compartmentalized scheme ,COMMA which we found out after the competition would not work at all .PERIOD 
And the ritz-carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel ,COMMA non-fire proof ,COMMA much like those old gas tanks .PERIOD 
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff ,COMMA and so it failed .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes .PERIOD So i'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD 
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal .PERIOD 
After some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln .PERIOD And then you end up with this carbonized material here .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA you can't burn this .PERIOD It's too fine .PERIOD And it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD 
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .PERIOD 
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes .PERIOD And you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted .PERIOD 
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .PERIOD 
They can generate income from this .PERIOD 
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal .PERIOD And they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own .PERIOD 
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand ,COMMA and where ,COMMA when you work <NUM> hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning <NUM> dollars in a month .PERIOD 
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .PERIOD 
Do you need to find entrepreneurs ,COMMA or venture capitalists ,COMMA or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale .PERIOD 
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .PERIOD 
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region .PERIOD 
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .PERIOD 
The usda allows these antibiotics ,COMMA these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply .PERIOD And the usda paid for this ad in time magazine .PERIOD 
It's no wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have criminals .PERIOD 
What goes in is what we are .PERIOD 
The cdc ;SEMICOLON the center for disease ,COMMA control has said of the children born in the year <NUM> -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three caucasians .PERIOD One out of every two african-americans and hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .PERIOD 
And it's because of what we feed them .PERIOD 
This is the usda portion size that little ,COMMA tiny thing .PERIOD 
In case you can't tell that's like pink danish ,COMMA and some kind of cupcakes .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this may be what a lot of parents serve ,COMMA as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .PERIOD 
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .PERIOD 
You're not going to get the next generation ,COMMA or the generation after ,COMMA to be able to think like this .PERIOD If they're not nourished .PERIOD 
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we have to change it .PERIOD 
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar ,COMMA they go up and down ,COMMA just like if they're on a diet of crack .PERIOD 
And we have to pull it all together .PERIOD We have composting in all of our schools .PERIOD 
Because you know what many of us are sort of at the end of our careers .PERIOD And we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids ,COMMA the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .PERIOD 
I had <NUM> employees .PERIOD 
In this country ,COMMA we're spending <NUM> billion dollars a year on fast food .PERIOD 
That :COLON <NUM> billion comes down to two dollars and <NUM> cents -- that's what the government allocates for lunch .PERIOD 
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .PERIOD 
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing .PERIOD 
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me .PERIOD 
Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them .PERIOD 
We crave the approval of our peers .PERIOD 
I'd like you all in the audience .PERIOD Now to push your lower jaw forward .PERIOD 
People know now that i'm enthusiastic ,COMMA that i'm a happy person .PERIOD 
He maintained a calm insouciance .PERIOD 
We can categorize it like that .PERIOD 
Because you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic .PERIOD 
I'll move it off ,COMMA and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish .PERIOD Amongst you .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA again ,COMMA as i told you ,COMMA if they have a caring family and good work life ,COMMA then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives .PERIOD 
So it's not simply a western phenomenon .PERIOD 
We make judgments on people's faces all the time .PERIOD 
Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly .PERIOD 
This is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .PERIOD 
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .PERIOD 
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system ,COMMA for the rest of their lives .PERIOD 
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer .PERIOD 
We still can't get rid of scars .PERIOD 
Whereas i felt that when you design ,COMMA you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in .PERIOD 
Working within the united states ,COMMA most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner .PERIOD But go live -- i live in bozeman montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to alabama or mississippi pre-katrina .PERIOD And i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries .PERIOD I've been to .PERIOD 
So in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit .PERIOD 
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change .PERIOD 
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD 
And it wasn't doctors telling us this .PERIOD It was actual villagers that we were staying with .PERIOD 
We just don't know how to show this .PERIOD 
And on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top .PERIOD And when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic ,COMMA and you eat it .PERIOD It's an eat your own clinic .PERIOD 
And you have to keep the maintenance down .PERIOD 
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv/aids outreach center ,COMMA and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors .PERIOD 
So this is the designer .PERIOD He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in kwa-zulu natal siyathemba ,COMMA and they can tell it better .PERIOD 
Video :COLON well ,COMMA my name is sisi ,COMMA because i work at the african center .PERIOD 
This was a connection ,COMMA just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop africa's first telemedicine center ,COMMA in tanzania .PERIOD 
This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled .PERIOD 
Designing housing this house is going to go in in a couple of weeks .PERIOD 
We put together very quickly a washroom .PERIOD 
This is shandra and the calhouns ,COMMA they're photographers who have documented the lower ninth for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
One billion people live in abject poverty .PERIOD 
If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen in <NUM> years .PERIOD One in three people will live in an unplanned settlement .PERIOD Or a refugee camp look left .PERIOD Look right .PERIOD One of you will be there .PERIOD 
And i want this whole thing to work multi-lingually .PERIOD 
The idea of needs-based competitions -- x-prize for the other <NUM> percent ,COMMA if you want to call it that .PERIOD 
We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together .PERIOD 
There should be a sheet .PERIOD I don't have time to read this because i'm going to be yanked off .PERIOD 
So i'm going to speak about a problem that i have ,COMMA and that's that i'm a philosopher .PERIOD 
And i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think that's impossible .PERIOD You can't explain consciousness .PERIOD 
My late lamented friend bob nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA philosophical explanations ,COMMA is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .PERIOD 
I'm sure that people here who work on ,COMMA say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen next .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think each of us seems to think i am an expert .PERIOD 
No other ingredients at all we're just made of cells about <NUM> trillion of them .PERIOD 
The content -- there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ;SEMICOLON there's memories ;SEMICOLON there's history .PERIOD And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .PERIOD 
So this is the problem .PERIOD So i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick ,COMMA explained to you .PERIOD 
It's one that i predicted in the last page or two of my <NUM> book consciousness explained ,COMMA where i said ,COMMA if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large ,COMMA changes .PERIOD 
And as i walked towards the picture ,COMMA i was expecting detail that wasn't there .PERIOD 
You're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is -- there you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD 
Now what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't think so not a chance ,COMMA but then how on earth is it done ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's the same thing .PERIOD 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all .PERIOD 
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right ,COMMA rotated .PERIOD 
Yes .PERIOD 
And if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment .PERIOD You don't know .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .PERIOD 
How many of you see that sort of boundary with the necker cube ,COMMA floating in front of the circles .PERIOD 
Can you see it .PERIOD 
When you see the cube one way behind the screen ,COMMA those boundaries go away .PERIOD 
And i supposed that that was just a flat truth .PERIOD Always true .PERIOD 
Let me just pause this for a second ,COMMA if i can .PERIOD 
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment .PERIOD 
Audience .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment .PERIOD There .PERIOD 
How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK How many still don't see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
And i ever met more humble people .PERIOD 
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears ,COMMA and welcomed as a gift .PERIOD 
What do we know about the women ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> years after the war .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for <NUM> years ,COMMA and hence diverging from the rest of mankind .PERIOD 
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region ,COMMA was in the late 1940s .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA you tear up the eleventh commandment -- national sovereignty .PERIOD 
We need to be at least as serious as we were .PERIOD Then .PERIOD 
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many ,COMMA though ,COMMA not all of the countries of the bottom billion .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a mass of new discoveries .PERIOD 
Just to give you one example .PERIOD Angola alone is getting <NUM> billion dollars a year in oil .PERIOD Revenue .PERIOD 
So here comes a bit of science .PERIOD And this is a bit of science i've done since the bottom billion .PERIOD So it's new .PERIOD 
Come back .PERIOD <NUM> years later .PERIOD 
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they've been sold over the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
A company flies in does a deal with a minister .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I was an unlikely person to be doing this .PERIOD 
I never studied sculpture ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA or architecture .PERIOD 
It's a self-portrait titled wide hips .PERIOD 
Returning to india to work with those fishermen ,COMMA we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots -- installed briefly .PERIOD In madrid .PERIOD 
My life was not going to be the same .PERIOD 
Next challenge the biennial of the americas in denver asked !EXCLAMATIONMARK Could i represent the <NUM> nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture .PERIOD 
I read about the recent earthquake in chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean .PERIOD 
I started my journey <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society .PERIOD 
And together they only form about <NUM> years of supply .PERIOD 
But now we have a real technology to do this .PERIOD 
When they control their brain ,COMMA they can control their pain .PERIOD 
When you do ,COMMA what do you want to control .PERIOD 
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself .PERIOD All your experiences .PERIOD 
These are some of the areas we're working on today that i don't have time to go into in detail .PERIOD 
But i want to leave with you the big question .PERIOD 
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into using this technology ,COMMA the human mind and brain .PERIOD 
What is worth dying for .PERIOD 
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children ,COMMA where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration ,COMMA where people are murdered indiscriminately .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA there are <NUM> states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal ,COMMA where it is legal for a teacher :COLON to beat a child with a wooden board ,COMMA hard ,COMMA and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .PERIOD 
But we can ask the obvious question :COLON is it a good idea ,COMMA generally speaking to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy ,COMMA emotional development and good behavior ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined ,COMMA and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .PERIOD 
When this statue was carved ,COMMA the average life expectancy was probably <NUM> .PERIOD 
Does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .PERIOD 
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .PERIOD 
And yet chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .PERIOD 
But what does voluntary mean in a community where ,COMMA when a girl gets raped ,COMMA her father's first impulse ,COMMA rather often ,COMMA is to murder her out of shame .PERIOD 
Just let that fact detonate in your brain .PERIOD For a minute ,COMMA your daughter gets raped ,COMMA and what you want to do is kill her .PERIOD 
But if we are in a reflective mood ,COMMA we can ask :COLON is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies .PERIOD 
Whenever we are talking about facts ,COMMA certain opinions must be excluded .PERIOD 
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock <NUM> years forward .PERIOD <NUM> years forward ,COMMA how you would like to think of the world ,COMMA balancing moral progress ,COMMA with richness .PERIOD 
But again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .PERIOD 
Sam ,COMMA this is a conversation i would actually love to continue for hours .PERIOD 
We don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time .PERIOD Thank you for coming to ted .PERIOD 
And then within zoology ,COMMA i took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects .PERIOD 
Because biological control phenomenon ,COMMA you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD 
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere .PERIOD 
So it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it .PERIOD 
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant ?QUESTIONMARK 
Insects :COLON those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms .PERIOD 
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf ,COMMA and on the middle ,COMMA cotton leaf ,COMMA and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA it's springtime .PERIOD Now ,COMMA in israel .PERIOD 
When temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones ,COMMA those aphids ,COMMA all over the plants ,COMMA in your hibiscus ,COMMA in your lantana .PERIOD In the young ,COMMA fresh foliage of the spring flush ,COMMA so-called .PERIOD 
This is all natural .PERIOD This is all natural .PERIOD 
Again .PERIOD We'll start first with the pest .PERIOD The thrips .PERIOD 
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults .PERIOD 
Many different parts .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA they have a very nice landscape -- you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand ,COMMA and a good mild winter and a nice ,COMMA hot summer .PERIOD Which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .PERIOD 
In this table ,COMMA you can actually see what is an impact of a successful ,COMMA biological control by good bugs .PERIOD 
But if we go for example to this place ,COMMA southeast israel ,COMMA the arava area above the great rift valley .PERIOD Where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert .PERIOD 
Step by step ,COMMA it does narrow .PERIOD 
So i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers ,COMMA in israel and abroad really give nature a chance .PERIOD 
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed ,COMMA such as somalia and rwanda and the former yugoslavia .PERIOD There are also societies today that may be close to collapse ,COMMA such as nepal .PERIOD Indonesia and columbia .PERIOD 
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have .PERIOD 
Why did they all end up dead ,COMMA well ,COMMA in my five-point framework ?QUESTIONMARK The first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment .PERIOD People inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD And in the case of the viking norse ,COMMA the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them ,COMMA because they required forests to make charcoal to make iron .PERIOD 
Or again ,COMMA the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade of the time ,COMMA when the soviet union was at its greatest power .PERIOD 
So this is a frequent theme :COLON societies collapse very soon .PERIOD After reaching their peak in power .PERIOD 
And i would expect that if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century ,COMMA people will be asking .PERIOD Why on earth did these people today ?QUESTIONMARK In the year <NUM> not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ?QUESTIONMARK 
One blueprint for trouble ,COMMA making collapse likely ,COMMA is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole .PERIOD Especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions ,COMMA where what's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole .PERIOD There's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run .PERIOD 
So that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions ,COMMA conflicts of interest .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD And since we made the problems we can also solve the problems that then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i think i'm actually the first one here -- i lead .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA i use nonsense ,COMMA as you can see .PERIOD 
This was one of a series called zany afternoons ,COMMA which became a book .PERIOD 
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man .PERIOD 
There's moscow ,COMMA shirley hope .PERIOD They speak esperanto .PERIOD 
Those ,COMMA for example ,COMMA are mark iv british tanks from <NUM> .PERIOD 
Happy little story .PERIOD Isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there .PERIOD 
It's obviously modeled on the titanic .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA i could jazz it up a bit .PERIOD Have a little fun with it .PERIOD 
This is the word side of my brain .PERIOD 
And then when it ran ,COMMA a lovely lady ,COMMA an old lady named mrs .PERIOD Edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said ,COMMA she loved the cover .PERIOD It was so sweet .PERIOD 
Pretty elegant ,COMMA nothing like a crash to end .PERIOD A joke that completes my oeuvre .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA i'm going to show you again ,COMMA something about our diets .PERIOD 
There's six million species of insects on this planet .PERIOD Six million species .PERIOD 
There was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the us economy benefited by <NUM> billion dollars per year .PERIOD 
Small animals eat insects .PERIOD 
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars ,COMMA locusts ,COMMA bee pupae -- delicacies .PERIOD 
You're eating at least <NUM> grams per year .PERIOD 
We're even doing this on purpose .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth .PERIOD 
There was an fao conference ,COMMA last october ,COMMA that was completely devoted to this .PERIOD 
And we eat quite a lot of it .PERIOD 
In the developing world ,COMMA it's much lower .PERIOD 
So if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .PERIOD 
There are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them .PERIOD And one of them is here in the audience ,COMMA marian peeters .PERIOD Who's in the picture .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative minister of agriculture .PERIOD And she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .PERIOD 
Reset the three minutes that's just not fair .PERIOD 
I would still be on my bad hip .PERIOD That was so disappointing .PERIOD 
Great :COLON excellent .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA no ,COMMA suddenly i wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list .PERIOD 
They were desperate for volunteers .PERIOD Because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was <NUM> .PERIOD 
So next thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i had my bright blue volunteer vest .PERIOD I had my photo id ,COMMA and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss .PERIOD 
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office .PERIOD 
But i'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA i've always wanted one of these .PERIOD 
And this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15th-century device .PERIOD 
So tonight ,COMMA if it's clear ,COMMA you'll be able to see the summer triangle .PERIOD 
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD 
He would know what time the sun would rise ,COMMA and what time it would set .PERIOD 
Probably not one made of brass .PERIOD He would have one made out of wood or paper .PERIOD And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket .PERIOD 
So what does the astrolabe inspire ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what we gain with a new technology ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy .PERIOD 
I'm just going to show you how the robot works .PERIOD 
So even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD Thus ,COMMA it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD 
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion .PERIOD 
We ,COMMA developed our adaptive gait ,COMMA planner .PERIOD 
Welcome to romela :COLON the robotics mechanisms ,COMMA laboratory at virginia tech .PERIOD 
This robot is an amoeba robot .PERIOD 
Robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments .PERIOD 
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in iraq ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the war zone ,COMMA there is roadside bombs .PERIOD Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed .PERIOD 
We actually have a fan club for the robot .PERIOD Darwin dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence .PERIOD 
So based on that success ,COMMA the following year ,COMMA we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .PERIOD 
And thus darwin ,COMMA i was born in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Dennis hong :COLON so ,COMMA there is actually a competition called robocup .PERIOD 
We were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid robocup competition .PERIOD 
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states .PERIOD So ,COMMA stay tuned .PERIOD 
How do we develop these kinds of ideas .PERIOD 
We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD We won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind .PERIOD 
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .PERIOD 
For us roboticists ,COMMA engineers and scientists .PERIOD These tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes .PERIOD You take in class .PERIOD 
These are all the tools that we need .PERIOD 
Bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .PERIOD 
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use .PERIOD 
He was brought in in october <NUM> ,COMMA as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD 
So in february of <NUM> .PERIOD Dr .PERIOD Zullinger invited us project .PERIOD H ,COMMA design -- which is a non-profit design firm that i founded -- to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district .PERIOD And to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district .PERIOD 
We now call this place home .PERIOD 
But beyond our personal reasons ,COMMA for wanting to be there there is a huge need .PERIOD 
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game ,COMMA play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid .PERIOD 
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer and we're helping dr .PERIOD Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD 
So we thought ,COMMA what if you could bring back shop class ?QUESTIONMARK But this time orient the projects around things that the community needed and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD 
So over the course of two semesters ,COMMA the fall and the spring ,COMMA the students ,COMMA spend three hours a day every single day in our <NUM> square foot studio/shop space .PERIOD 
So what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills ,COMMA so that she might give back in the most meaningful way .PERIOD 
So for him ,COMMA studio ,COMMA h offers him a way to develop the skills .PERIOD He will need .PERIOD As an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .PERIOD 
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy ,COMMA and from where ?QUESTIONMARK And why -- that's a homework assignment .PERIOD 
Because when you zoom out that far you lose the ability to view people as humans .PERIOD 
If you are a blind child in india ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .PERIOD 
So i felt that i needed to do two things .PERIOD 
Here's the eye with the opaque lens .PERIOD The opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the story holds true .PERIOD Even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .PERIOD 
So the way we study that is let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity .PERIOD 
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies ,COMMA but i want to highlight one particular one .PERIOD And that is image parsing into objects .PERIOD 
So any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image or a synthetic image ,COMMA it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column ,COMMA regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances .PERIOD 
And nobody knows how this integration happens ,COMMA and that's the question we asked with project .PERIOD Prakash .PERIOD 
Doctor ,COMMA what are their shapes .PERIOD 
Doctor now .PERIOD 
So we are creating dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive and autonomously .PERIOD Discovering :COLON what are the objects in this visual input ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like .PERIOD 
What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input .PERIOD The baby very quickly ,COMMA is able to discover meaning in such input .PERIOD 
Even before the ball gets to a place ,COMMA the child is already looking there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA to summarize prakash in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ,COMMA ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain ,COMMA to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism .PERIOD The development of autonomous machine vision systems ,COMMA education of the undergraduate and graduate students ;SEMICOLON and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA what am i getting myself into .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA really ,COMMA you can .PERIOD 
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level .PERIOD 
It was really ,COMMA really hot .PERIOD 
And it's the first -- i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,COMMA and i didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA pistoning in the socket .PERIOD 
He kept me on the right track .PERIOD 
Everyone was taking pictures -- what is this girl running on .PERIOD 
I'm sitting there like ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA oh my god .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they call us out .PERIOD And ,COMMA you know -- ladies ,COMMA you have one minute .PERIOD 
And i had to think ,COMMA why did i do this .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD 
It has a shock absorber in it .PERIOD So it ,COMMA like shhhh ,COMMA makes this neat sound .PERIOD When you jump around on it all right .PERIOD 
In these .PERIOD 
For me while i'm such a serious athlete on the track ,COMMA i want to be feminine off the track .PERIOD And i think it's so important not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA your mobility ,COMMA or even fashion .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes i want ,COMMA the skirts i want -- and i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .PERIOD 
Two weeks ago ,COMMA aimee ,COMMA was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys .PERIOD 
They didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD They just did it .PERIOD 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy .PERIOD 
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that ,COMMA but -- all about what happens .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .PERIOD 
It's the chore .PERIOD 
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means .PERIOD 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD 
And i'll say ,COMMA hmm ,COMMA not sure .PERIOD I'll think about it roughly .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA one of them is they say ,COMMA you need to get the basics first .PERIOD 
That somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing .PERIOD But if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual .PERIOD 
Might have been <NUM> years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore .PERIOD 
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand ,COMMA that the computer should be doing anyway .PERIOD 
Same principles applied -- calculations ,COMMA harder .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the problem we've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now .PERIOD 
So if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer ,COMMA you can understand how the basics of the system work better .PERIOD 
So programming is the way i think we should be doing that .PERIOD 
This was an example .PERIOD I built for my daughter .PERIOD 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus ,COMMA and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world .PERIOD 
It's like the land and the king they're inseparable .PERIOD They are one .PERIOD 
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers .PERIOD 
And finally to pull out all the stops .PERIOD This is a system called urp .PERIOD For urban planners ,COMMA in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted ,COMMA that they use cad systems .PERIOD 
It projects down digital shadows ,COMMA as you see here .PERIOD 
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate .PERIOD Even though they don't know anything about urban planning to move a building ,COMMA you simply reach out your hand and you move the building .PERIOD 
This work is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
And the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative <NUM> that we were painting in the film be believable ,COMMA that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an r&ampd effort .PERIOD 
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual .PERIOD 
People still reference those sequences in minority report ,COMMA when they talk about new ui design .PERIOD 
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the united states .PERIOD 
This is a system called tamper ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be .PERIOD 
We'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend ,COMMA and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD 
Let me leave with one final thought ,COMMA and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift .PERIOD 
Can it be for every man ,COMMA or is this just for corporations and movie producers .PERIOD 
That's our goal entirely .PERIOD 
So this is the inevitability about it .PERIOD 
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .PERIOD 
It was a wonderful experience .PERIOD 
You can just google it .PERIOD 
As i say ,COMMA in my book ,COMMA i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .PERIOD 
The first thing i did was ,COMMA i got a stack of bibles .PERIOD 
I had christian bibles .PERIOD 
So i wanted to follow that rule .PERIOD 
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .PERIOD 
But it's a big part of the bible .PERIOD So i figured i had to address it .PERIOD 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected .PERIOD My mind .PERIOD 
And i explained my project and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i am an adulterer ,COMMA are you going to stone me ?QUESTIONMARK 
They really did a fantastic job .PERIOD 
I wanted it to be about religion in america .PERIOD 
So this was very inspiring to me .PERIOD 
I recommend jim wallis and tony campolo .PERIOD 
They're very inspiring leaders .PERIOD Even though i disagree with much of what they say .PERIOD 
And i would say ,COMMA but that's crazy .PERIOD 
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .PERIOD 
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion ,COMMA and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way .PERIOD And they'll say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria ,COMMA religion .PERIOD 
You're just picking and choosing .PERIOD 
The story starts in kenya in december of <NUM> .PERIOD When there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD 
And she quickly said it's too much .PERIOD 
And enough people looked at it ,COMMA and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform .PERIOD 
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global projects .PERIOD 
And once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again and they could work on getting it .PERIOD Better .PERIOD 
Even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels <NUM> years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA before i talk about what is ,COMMA i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi ,COMMA i want to talk about their shared source .PERIOD 
At pick-up time .PERIOD The teachers who have been with your children all day ,COMMA would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .PERIOD 
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average .PERIOD And then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .PERIOD 
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .PERIOD 
It's value created by the participants ,COMMA but enjoyed by society as a whole .PERIOD 
The goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating .PERIOD 
We've got a choice before us .PERIOD 
And may it run forever ,COMMA because it gives people like me a living .PERIOD 
There were two sundays in between .PERIOD But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA sundays are church days .PERIOD So you don't play on sundays ,COMMA and one day it rained .PERIOD So they all sat around making friends with each other .PERIOD 
And then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again .PERIOD 
Take a look .PERIOD You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there .PERIOD You could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere ,COMMA because the bat hit the wall .PERIOD Don't forget the air conditioning ,COMMA and the cable wires .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere .PERIOD 
And we won this world cup in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And so we allowed multinationals into india .PERIOD 
We cut customs duties ,COMMA we reduced import duties ,COMMA and we got all the multinationals coming in ,COMMA with multinational budgets ,COMMA who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india ,COMMA and were looking for a vehicle to reach .PERIOD Every indian .PERIOD 
But what a game we had ?QUESTIONMARK M ?QUESTIONMARK S :COLON dhoni got it right in the air ,COMMA but misbah-ul-haq what ?QUESTIONMARK A player .PERIOD 
A massive ,COMMA massive success .PERIOD India ,COMMA the world tt champions .PERIOD 
So it was a different india .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot -- if mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park ,COMMA or somewhere to source them .PERIOD They could go to trinidad .PERIOD 
So he played in hyderabad ,COMMA went straight .PERIOD After the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in portugal ,COMMA second refueling in brazil .PERIOD He was in west indies in time .PERIOD 
They started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan .PERIOD 
For a long time ,COMMA india was this country of poverty ,COMMA dust ,COMMA beggars ,COMMA snake charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA delhi belly -- people heard delhi belly stories before they came .PERIOD 
Hopefully it'll make everyone richer ,COMMA hopefully .PERIOD It'll make the game bigger .PERIOD And hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business .PERIOD 
We all make decisions every day .PERIOD We want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic .PERIOD 
And surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times ,COMMA that would be a tremendous gift .PERIOD 
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine .PERIOD Bet .PERIOD 
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy .PERIOD There are six sides to a die ,COMMA two sides to a coin ,COMMA <NUM> cards in a deck .PERIOD 
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter .PERIOD 
Why in the world ?QUESTIONMARK Would anybody ever play the lottery ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there are many answers ,COMMA but one answer surely is we see a lot of winners right when this couple wins the lottery .PERIOD Or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size ?QUESTIONMARK I don't know .PERIOD 
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost .PERIOD 
You can't say to yourself ,COMMA i'm as likely to win as anybody ,COMMA because you're not as likely to win as leroy .PERIOD 
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages .PERIOD Even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period .PERIOD Here's another nice example .PERIOD 
Here's a :COLON $2000 :COLON hawaiian :COLON vacation package .PERIOD It's now on sale for <NUM> .PERIOD 
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal in other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal .PERIOD That was once a horrible deal .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it .PERIOD Here's a schematic of what happened ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself ,COMMA i'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD 
Nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD 
When you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go .PERIOD I'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or i'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD It's money .PERIOD 
And if a drive across town is worth <NUM> bucks ,COMMA it's worth <NUM> bucks .PERIOD No matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD People don't think that way .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA people are enormously impatient .PERIOD 
Imagine that you can have <NUM> dollars in a year -- that's <NUM> months -- or <NUM> dollars in <NUM> months .PERIOD 
This is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is ,COMMA people find that the subjective value of <NUM> is higher than the subjective value of <NUM> when they'll be delivered in now or one month ,COMMA respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern .PERIOD When you push the entire decision off into the future a year .PERIOD 
What causes the bug ?QUESTIONMARK Is it ?QUESTIONMARK The drama of the event ?QUESTIONMARK -- that it's so spectacular .PERIOD 
I don't want to say -- please ,COMMA i'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying ,COMMA terrorism is fine ;SEMICOLON and we shouldn't be so distressed .PERIOD 
What i'm saying is that surely ,COMMA rationally ,COMMA our distress about things ,COMMA that happen ,COMMA about threats ,COMMA should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come .PERIOD 
There's no question .PERIOD 
And so we evolved these responses .PERIOD 
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning .PERIOD 
That's what you think it is .PERIOD All right .PERIOD 
And as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people .PERIOD 
It's the sequel to an inconvenient truth .PERIOD And it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .PERIOD 
Or we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .PERIOD 
Mike matas .PERIOD And so throughout the whole book ,COMMA al gore will walk you through and explain the photos .PERIOD 
This photo you can .PERIOD You can even see on an interactive map .PERIOD 
And while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page and the movie keeps playing .PERIOD 
This is very strange for me ,COMMA because i’m not used to doing this .PERIOD I usually stand on the other side of the light ,COMMA and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into .PERIOD And it's hard .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we’ll go with the first piece .PERIOD 
Court ,COMMA i don't want to get rid of you .PERIOD 
Boy .PERIOD Look !EXCLAMATIONMARK Man !EXCLAMATIONMARK Reading !EXCLAMATIONMARK Don't feed !EXCLAMATIONMARK No .PERIOD One .PERIOD 
Boy arguing with you is a waste of time .PERIOD Marcus .PERIOD 
Marcus ,COMMA when a man resorts to profanities ,COMMA it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself .PERIOD 
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from hollywood to go and film ,COMMA something real .PERIOD 
The first piece was really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling .PERIOD She'll be happy .PERIOD There .PERIOD 
So that whole thing ,COMMA that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .PERIOD 
Commander soldiers :COLON you are going to fight a battle .PERIOD So you must get ready and willing to die .PERIOD 
C :COLON success :COLON the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun .PERIOD 
I don’t remember how we got there .PERIOD 
The injection made us not to have mind .PERIOD 
Various !EXCLAMATIONMARK Voices :COLON you will die ?QUESTIONMARK You will die .PERIOD 
Onicha :COLON ezra .PERIOD 
Why you giving these to me .PERIOD 
Mr :COLON ezra gelehun :COLON please stand .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA we don’t .PERIOD 
Mr .PERIOD Gelehun .PERIOD I'd like to remind you ,COMMA you're not on trial here today .PERIOD 
You are not on trial .PERIOD 
E ,COMMA so ,COMMA you are a liar .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
In the process of my research ,COMMA i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this .PERIOD 
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them .PERIOD 
Frank :COLON gehry :COLON i listened to this scientist this morning .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it is astonishing for an artist ,COMMA for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD 
And i realized when i'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff .PERIOD And people would just look at me .PERIOD Like i'd just landed from mars .PERIOD 
And like ,COMMA the playwright said the other day -- i could relate to him ,COMMA you're not sure .PERIOD 
Yeah .PERIOD 
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients .PERIOD 
If you think about the world and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings .PERIOD 
I knew craig and respected him .PERIOD 
I knew you'd ask that question .PERIOD 
I tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off .PERIOD And there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't .PERIOD 
Siza on the other hand continued in portugal ,COMMA where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .PERIOD 
I tried to get him a couple of jobs ,COMMA and they didn't pan out .PERIOD 
Where you it's like ,COMMA jazz :COLON you improvise .PERIOD You work together .PERIOD You play off each other .PERIOD You make something they make something .PERIOD 
Richard koshalek [unclear] starts from <NUM> .PERIOD 
You can come to the opening ,COMMA i'll invite you .PERIOD 
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at ted .PERIOD 
They came for three days .PERIOD 
You've all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said ,COMMA mr .PERIOD Wright ,COMMA i'm sitting on the couch ,COMMA and the water's pouring in on my head .PERIOD 
Rsw :COLON didn't get a laugh .PERIOD 
What do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's what reminded me of it .PERIOD 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner .PERIOD 
We sat down and we had a drink of water ,COMMA and everybody was quiet .PERIOD 
So i got up .PERIOD 
They just brought us there to hustle this group .PERIOD You know ,COMMA to create a project .PERIOD 
Because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody ,COMMA so .PERIOD 
But reliable dutchman -- -- fantastic .PERIOD 
And this was the text -- in words as fashion the same rule will hold/ alike fantastic if too new or old/ be not the first by whom the new are tried/ ,COMMA nor yet the last to lay the old aside .PERIOD 
So it was going ,COMMA nowhere ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's what happens .PERIOD 
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations .PERIOD 
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious .PERIOD 
But we don't have time .PERIOD 
There were <NUM> artists invited to participate in it .PERIOD And it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive ,COMMA and i didn't want to be embarrassed .PERIOD So i worked very hard on this .PERIOD 
But i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was .PERIOD 
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up .PERIOD 
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD 
So this is the question ,COMMA my students ,COMMA and i wanted to get at .PERIOD 
What if we put holly into the same context ,COMMA as humans .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans .PERIOD 
They were these kind of weird things .PERIOD 
So the monkeys get really good at this .PERIOD 
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other ,COMMA often from us -- you know things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing .PERIOD But things we spontaneously saw .PERIOD 
We were a little impatient .PERIOD So we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .PERIOD 
Sounds great .PERIOD But you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD 
Your other option is a bit safe .PERIOD Your just going to get some money for sure .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA see what your intuition is here .PERIOD 
Most people say ,COMMA why should i be risky when i can get <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK For sure .PERIOD 
And now imagine that i have ,COMMA you make another choice ,COMMA but this time it's a little bit worse .PERIOD 
They actually tend to go a little risky .PERIOD 
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this .PERIOD 
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky ,COMMA because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD 
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms .PERIOD 
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases .PERIOD 
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero .PERIOD 
Now the monkeys meet two guys ,COMMA who aren't giving them bonuses ,COMMA they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a little bad -- sorry .PERIOD Sorry .PERIOD Sorry .PERIOD 
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD 
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations .PERIOD 
We have this great north ,COMMA and there was a pretty small population .PERIOD And my father was an avid outdoorsman .PERIOD 
But what i think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening ,COMMA and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines ,COMMA the untouched forest that i was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time ,COMMA that this has gone on for a long time .PERIOD And we're experiencing it in a different way .PERIOD 
This rebirth of grass .PERIOD And then i went out for years ,COMMA trying to photograph the pristine landscape .PERIOD 
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions .PERIOD 
But we've become totally disconnected from them .PERIOD 
That if we keep putting things through industrial and urban existence ,COMMA back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on .PERIOD 
Because i think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads and everything -- are directly a result .PERIOD 
I'm going to move to some pictures of china .PERIOD 
So this created a reservoir <NUM> kilometers ,COMMA long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA the rebuilding of the city -- to me ,COMMA it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of .PERIOD I guess what we know here in terms of urban planning .PERIOD 
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country .PERIOD 
So this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD It's a shoe factory .PERIOD 
And they have dorms for the workers .PERIOD 
This is one with <NUM> .PERIOD So ,COMMA every lunch ,COMMA there's about <NUM> coming through for lunch .PERIOD 
They sit down .PERIOD They have about <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
They're not getting enough ,COMMA so they're not going to move .PERIOD 
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that i don't think any city has experienced .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA even shenzhen ,COMMA the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- <NUM> years ago ,COMMA was about <NUM> people .PERIOD And today it boasts about <NUM> to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD 
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with china is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology .PERIOD 
But that is the trick that they've got right now that they're winning with ,COMMA is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play .PERIOD But the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD They want to work .PERIOD 
I had to have them freeze for <NUM> seconds to get this shot .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> of these machines ,COMMA they're worth about <NUM> dollars .PERIOD Each .PERIOD 
So you have about <NUM> people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines .PERIOD 
This was one of the biggest factories i've ever seen .PERIOD 
But this is what happens to most of the computers .PERIOD 
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems .PERIOD I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD 
Some of you might know ,COMMA he's a tedster -- stephen sagmeister ,COMMA and i are working on some layouts .PERIOD And this is still in preliminary stages .PERIOD These aren't the finals .PERIOD But these images with worldchangingcom can be placed into any kind of media .PERIOD 
So we're looking at this as trying to build out .PERIOD 
And anything that you can do to promote ,COMMA that would be fantastic .PERIOD 
That would be fantastic .PERIOD So those are my three wishes .PERIOD 
And i'd like to start at the very beginning .PERIOD 
The more stuff that's mine .PERIOD The better .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA it's your stuff ,COMMA if it's broken .PERIOD 
And they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD 
So about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i literally started in my garage tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other ,COMMA and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends ,COMMA in the mining world ,COMMA actually and in the plastics world .PERIOD And we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .PERIOD 
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant ,COMMA that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life .PERIOD Our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .PERIOD 
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i hope i've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .PERIOD 
Mother .PERIOD Nature wastes very little ,COMMA reuses practically everything .PERIOD 
And i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label i've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form ,COMMA until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD 
Now it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,COMMA and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy messed it up .PERIOD 
Now that's compassion .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA i kind of look at the world ,COMMA this way .PERIOD 
I see -- always it stirs my heart -- a picture of dr .PERIOD Martin luther king ,COMMA jr .PERIOD 
This is the picture .PERIOD They said ,COMMA it's going to be too volatile for you to go .PERIOD 
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .PERIOD 
And whatever else is needed ,COMMA i will provide it and pay for it when i return .PERIOD 
This always seemed to me ,COMMA to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan .PERIOD 
But now to be a good samaritan -- and i always say ,COMMA and to be a good american -- for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD 
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense ,COMMA not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion .PERIOD 
I just want to say my name is emmanuel jal .PERIOD 
And also telling it like now .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .PERIOD 
I wanted to revenge for my village .PERIOD 
My every moment .PERIOD 
Run duck ,COMMA play dead ,COMMA and hide .PERIOD 
But still ,COMMA as i wonder ,COMMA i won't go under .PERIOD 
I was ready to eat .PERIOD 
Give us tools ,COMMA give the farmers tools .PERIOD 
And now we have a couple in university .PERIOD 
♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA yeah ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refugee ♫ thank you .PERIOD 
We've used fear if you like to grab people's attention .PERIOD 
A deer freezes very ,COMMA very still ,COMMA poised to run away .PERIOD 
And i think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .PERIOD 
And unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world say that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important .PERIOD 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .PERIOD 
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used ,COMMA typically in [the] western world -- a quarter of the resources .PERIOD 
What's happening in ?QUESTIONMARK Costa rica .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .PERIOD 
And so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome .PERIOD We want to .PERIOD 
A child entering school today will be my age in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And i put it to you that is not business as usual .PERIOD 
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .PERIOD 
And the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that i think happiness will flow out the side from .PERIOD 
Keep building them .PERIOD 
The second one is be active .PERIOD 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness ,COMMA cognitive behavioral therapy ,COMMA [very] strong for our well being .PERIOD 
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .PERIOD 
All that being good and no real credit for it .PERIOD 
So i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA mom and dad ,COMMA what about santa claus .PERIOD 
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning .PERIOD But only if all of us kids did not make a fuss .PERIOD 
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence .PERIOD Our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit .PERIOD And my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly -- but let's face it .PERIOD He was also very judgmental .PERIOD 
They had to fit two criteria .PERIOD They had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason ,COMMA and not yet seven .PERIOD 
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man ,COMMA and bill said ,COMMA so .PERIOD And then i said ,COMMA so you're six ,COMMA you have a whole year to do anything you want to .PERIOD And god won't notice it .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA so ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA so so everything and i turned to run ,COMMA i was so angry with him .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september <NUM> .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i was raised in the pacific northwest ,COMMA around a lot of church of latter-day saints ,COMMA people ,COMMA and you know i've worked with them and even dated them ,COMMA but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission .PERIOD And i guess i was sort of ,COMMA curious .PERIOD So i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA please come in .PERIOD And they looked really happy because i don't think this happens to them all that often .PERIOD 
And i sat them down ,COMMA and i got them glasses of water -- ok .PERIOD I got it .PERIOD I got them glasses of water .PERIOD 
And they told me this story ,COMMA all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in <NUM> bc .PERIOD 
I wanted to say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA don't start with this story .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA come on .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were <NUM> to the time they were <NUM> ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion .PERIOD It still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god .PERIOD And they said ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA oh -- hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state .PERIOD 
Or if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see .PERIOD 
If someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic ,COMMA theology and dogma for the very first time ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse .PERIOD And the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby ,COMMA and that's the son of god .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA i would think that's equally ridiculous .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA breast cancer .PERIOD 
Overcome with the enormity of it all .PERIOD And the complete feeling of loss of control ,COMMA i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband ,COMMA jayant .PERIOD 
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .PERIOD 
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you .PERIOD So moves you that something ,COMMA even like cancer becomes insignificant .PERIOD 
It's the power of an image .PERIOD 
Nobody really did anything with it .PERIOD Pretty much .PERIOD 
They brought all sorts of different computers with them .PERIOD 
So that in all that diversity ,COMMA if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this ,COMMA and a bit of this everything i looked into ,COMMA i had to connect to some new machine .PERIOD I had to learn to run some new program .PERIOD I would find the information i wanted in some new data .PERIOD Format .PERIOD 
And that is what has made it .PERIOD Most fun .PERIOD 
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little ,COMMA initial website that we started off with .PERIOD 
One of the great -- yes ,COMMA a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great ted talks .PERIOD 
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed for various different countries ,COMMA in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis ,COMMA and he showed infant mortality .PERIOD And he shot this thing animated through time .PERIOD 
So he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD 
It had underground all the data ,COMMA ok ,COMMA data is brown and boxy and boring .PERIOD And that's how we think of it .PERIOD Isn't it .PERIOD 
In this case hans had put the data together ,COMMA he had found from all kinds of united nations ,COMMA websites and things .PERIOD 
We're using them for people .PERIOD We're using them for places .PERIOD We're using them for your products .PERIOD We're using them for events .PERIOD 
I wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago .PERIOD And soon after that things started to happen .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now .PERIOD 
Practice that it's important ,COMMA because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you .PERIOD Even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD 
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head ,COMMA they try to communicate those over the web .PERIOD 
And that is what linked data is all about .PERIOD 
You get this really huge power out of it .PERIOD 
Then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that i felt good about myself .PERIOD 
Right now ,COMMA as bill mcdonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .PERIOD 
And i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless ,COMMA and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD They had a diagnosis .PERIOD It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where ,COMMA when we see ,COMMA when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery .PERIOD 
One day ,COMMA soon after that -- it was a friday -- at the end of the day ,COMMA i went down -- i was going down to the subway ;SEMICOLON it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD 
And anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off .PERIOD 
And then yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA how do you do this .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA i suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage .PERIOD Since you asked the question .PERIOD 
So just help us with some of the numbers .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i think -- ca :COLON but is that your hair .PERIOD 
Ok .PERIOD 
Of course .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA well ,COMMA <NUM> years earlier we'd launched the sex pistols' ,COMMA god save the queen ,COMMA and i'd certainly never expected that <NUM> years later -- that she'd actually knight us .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i got pulled out of the sea ,COMMA i think ,COMMA six times by helicopters .PERIOD So -- and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale .PERIOD 
But the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time .PERIOD And on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA no ,COMMA i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon ,COMMA with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below ,COMMA trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea ,COMMA which -- and it was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very lonely few moments .PERIOD 
The years -- and until i stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the uk .PERIOD And elsewhere .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school .PERIOD 
And generally ,COMMA the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's bad news .PERIOD 
Did this really happen .PERIOD 
And making us go on wonderful ,COMMA long bike rides .PERIOD 
But is there a risk here ?QUESTIONMARK 
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the uk .PERIOD 
We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots .PERIOD But nobody came with vd ,COMMA any more .PERIOD 
And john mortimer ,COMMA the playwright ,COMMA defended us .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side .PERIOD 
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance .PERIOD 
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people ,COMMA and therefore extreme responsibility ,COMMA i think ,COMMA goes with that wealth .PERIOD 
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west get so excited about -- i mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea getting stuff done ,COMMA and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world .PERIOD 
But i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA richard ,COMMA when i was starting off in business ,COMMA i knew nothing about it .PERIOD And i also was sort of -- i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless ,COMMA and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding .PERIOD 
So i would like to thank you for that inspiration ,COMMA and for coming to ted today .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
I would say with a great smile ,COMMA i will definitely pass .PERIOD 
He just started asking where ?QUESTIONMARK Did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK How much is it .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i teach at a college of arts .PERIOD 
It can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing .PERIOD Whatever it is .PERIOD 
But it is just a kind of trace of that time .PERIOD 
So it took about <NUM> hours to get this line .PERIOD 
So what we see is just what we think often ,COMMA and most of the time ,COMMA we don't see what it is .PERIOD 
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know ,COMMA this is a work called light makes dark .PERIOD 
This is an exact negative .PERIOD 
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six seven months in the restroom ,COMMA when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor .PERIOD 
This is the work .PERIOD I made out of that material .PERIOD 
So i told them i'd like to start an air freshener company .PERIOD 
So i just started doing this work ,COMMA to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object ,COMMA and there .PERIOD 
Because as a visual artist ,COMMA if i'm seeing this ,COMMA and i'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
It's the same in marketing .PERIOD 
It :COLON only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .PERIOD 
Take bp -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand .PERIOD But then one little accident .PERIOD 
The same is true of marketing .PERIOD 
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand .PERIOD 
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- vielle à roue .PERIOD 
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .PERIOD 
And today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music -- in the uk .PERIOD In france ,COMMA in spain ,COMMA and in italy .PERIOD 
But the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD 
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving :COLON an intense craving to be with a particular person ,COMMA not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally .PERIOD 
And then the very last question ,COMMA i would ask them -- i would always have to work myself up to this question ,COMMA because i am not a psychologist .PERIOD 
The motor of the brain ,COMMA it's a drive .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA i think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car .PERIOD 
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy .PERIOD 
They've got incredible people skills ,COMMA negotiating skills .PERIOD 
They're highly imaginative .PERIOD 
And -- basic math .PERIOD 
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD 
I even think that marriages might even become more stable ,COMMA because of the second great world trend .PERIOD 
It may decline ,COMMA some more .PERIOD 
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated .PERIOD So interesting ,COMMA so capable .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this .PERIOD 
In these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together .PERIOD 
But i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .PERIOD 
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love .PERIOD 
And wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome .PERIOD 
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD 
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil .PERIOD 
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants -- the big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country -- and what the small wants -- the individual ,COMMA the person .PERIOD 
Charlie ,COMMA ledbetter .PERIOD Yesterday ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers ,COMMA to bring people into the process of creating things .PERIOD 
And that's what i want to talk about today .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
I think something happens .PERIOD I think a head may appear in a second .PERIOD 
We showed them the whole cut and they were all completely .PERIOD What is this .PERIOD 
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD 
It's a history of invention based around this .PERIOD 
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and i'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing .PERIOD 
Why do we line up ?QUESTIONMARK The square milk carton with the square fence .PERIOD 
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to .PERIOD 
We don't know why ,COMMA but we do .PERIOD 
So what is this ?QUESTIONMARK I hear you all ask .PERIOD No ,COMMA i don't .PERIOD 
So what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD 
These guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD 
How far you can anticipate ,COMMA what follows from it ?QUESTIONMARK What are the threats ?QUESTIONMARK What are the possibilities ?QUESTIONMARK The challenges ,COMMA the opportunities .PERIOD 
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance .PERIOD In our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30-odd years later .PERIOD Wind energy ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA biomass ,COMMA solar ,COMMA cells .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA if in that bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back and we look at planet earth and we take a kind of typical industrialized society ,COMMA then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings .PERIOD <NUM> percent ,COMMA transport ,COMMA <NUM> percent and industry .PERIOD 
If you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example -- and munich is not a bad example of that ,COMMA with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city ,COMMA which is really only twice as dense ,COMMA is only using one-tenth of the energy .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous .PERIOD 
How does it affect the design of buildings .PERIOD 
The one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town .PERIOD In the northeast of england ,COMMA commuting distance with london .PERIOD 
This building was wired for change .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .PERIOD 
And if i fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory .PERIOD 
The library of the free university ,COMMA which opened last year ,COMMA is an example of that .PERIOD 
So it's not a kind of sacrifice quite the reverse .PERIOD 
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit ,COMMA to transfer that information now directly into the factory .PERIOD 
For wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable and so on .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA major transformation .PERIOD 
It's been well known that the dead sea is dying .PERIOD 
How do you make them more friendly at that scale ?QUESTIONMARK 
Hong kong :COLON i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age .PERIOD Because you always have a point of reference .PERIOD 
<NUM> -- excuse me ,COMMA <NUM> people ,COMMA working .PERIOD <NUM> hours ,COMMA seven days .PERIOD 
Contagious is a good word .PERIOD 
Laughter is contagious .PERIOD Passion is contagious .PERIOD 
And that directly increased student wellbeing .PERIOD

And ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA this program is wonderful .PERIOD 
We have to start collecting from <NUM> .PERIOD 
Kbs :COLON so the charter of compassion starts right here .PERIOD 
It was incredible .PERIOD 
Now i was paid in dollars as a consultant .PERIOD And i looked at my income tax return ,COMMA and tried to ask myself ,COMMA is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible .PERIOD 
I tried to convince myself that no no .PERIOD I have worked for the policy .PERIOD Changes .PERIOD 
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma ,COMMA because i couldn't live with it any longer .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD 
These are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network ,COMMA that whenever we learn something from people ,COMMA it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD 
You cannot discriminate .PERIOD 
I'm so sorry to say that .PERIOD 
The rice that you ate in the lunch and you will eat today ,COMMA is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,COMMA millions of them .PERIOD Every season ,COMMA in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water .PERIOD 
And feet in the water will develop fungus ,COMMA infections ,COMMA and that infection pains because then other insects bite .PERIOD That point .PERIOD 
And this is what he got ,COMMA painted .PERIOD 
There could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD 
So here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine .PERIOD 
So it is better .PERIOD It is safer .PERIOD It is affordable .PERIOD It is energy-efficient .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA cell phones ,COMMA we have <NUM> million cellphones in this country .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books .PERIOD For example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model .PERIOD 
Look at what he is doing .PERIOD 
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility .PERIOD 
And we have a very vibrant network in china ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .PERIOD 
I can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but i can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD 
And this is a donkey cart ,COMMA which they modified .PERIOD 
This is in china .PERIOD This girl needed a breathing apparatus .PERIOD 
There's a whole range of innovations that we have .PERIOD 
A car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer .PERIOD 
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal .PERIOD But he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun .PERIOD 
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum .PERIOD 
They created this shade that you can see here ,COMMA which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD 
They allowed themselves a few mistakes ,COMMA along the way .PERIOD 
This is richard kelly who was born <NUM> years ago ,COMMA which is the reason i bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year .PERIOD 
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around .PERIOD 
These three distinct elements together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD 
How do they share their culture .PERIOD 
The problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but i can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA just to explain .PERIOD 
Why are all these motorways permanently lit .PERIOD 
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness .PERIOD 
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ,COMMA so they really want to connect with it like here .PERIOD 
Where have they come from ?QUESTIONMARK Where are they going .PERIOD 
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light .PERIOD 
They pointed out that i believe it was between <NUM> and <NUM> years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire ,COMMA without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD 
It really was a big idea in technology .PERIOD When we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community .PERIOD 
The big idea here is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA <NUM> percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ;SEMICOLON it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .PERIOD 
It all made sense with <NUM> percent of the people living there .PERIOD 
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air ,COMMA and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD 
I don't look like a motor vehicle .PERIOD 
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter .PERIOD And i don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .PERIOD 
Then she looks up ,COMMA she's looking up ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA and i'm <NUM> years old ,COMMA and i don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD 
We need water .PERIOD 
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing ,COMMA with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for <NUM> watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat .PERIOD It will make <NUM> gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .PERIOD 
So if we put this box on here ,COMMA in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation ,COMMA electricity and communication ,COMMA and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important .PERIOD We'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first .PERIOD 
And then it's time to do it again .PERIOD Last year .PERIOD 
After it falls below a critical price ,COMMA it will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration .PERIOD 
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them and bring the rest of your entertainment in .PERIOD 
This is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails .PERIOD 
Linux !EXCLAMATIONMARK Is another good example .PERIOD 
Two percent isn't <NUM> percent ,COMMA but in the car business ,COMMA which is slow moving .PERIOD That's huge .PERIOD That's arrival .PERIOD 
Free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD It comes with ip because it's such an efficient protocol .PERIOD It comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth .PERIOD 
It's an economic force .PERIOD It's a technical force .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA there could be a film's [unclear] there ,COMMA but it's basically every song ever made could be stored on <NUM> dollars worth of storage by <NUM> .PERIOD It takes that entire element ,COMMA the physical element ,COMMA of songs off the table .PERIOD 
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about .PERIOD 
And by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul .PERIOD A global citizen .PERIOD 
Even more problematic ,COMMA they're not listening to poor people themselves .PERIOD 
In <NUM> .PERIOD I met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india ,COMMA who'd been working for <NUM> years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .PERIOD 
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that <NUM> million farmers alone in india ,COMMA make under a dollar a day .PERIOD 
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers ,COMMA because these systems were both too expensive ,COMMA and they were constructed for fields that were too large .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet ,COMMA and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors ,COMMA agriculture .PERIOD 
Secondarily we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD 
In arusha ,COMMA tanzania ,COMMA a to z ,COMMA textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund ,COMMA to create a factory that now employs <NUM> people .PERIOD Mostly women .PERIOD 
So that in the terrorist attacks ,COMMA of november they were the first responder ,COMMA and are now beginning to scale ,COMMA because of partnership .PERIOD 
President obama understands that .PERIOD 
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban .PERIOD

During the hurricane ,COMMA you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog ,COMMA updating it frequently .PERIOD This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .PERIOD 
They sent a search party ,COMMA and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself ,COMMA jumped off bible peak .PERIOD 
And i won it .PERIOD I reached all of these people .PERIOD And i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life ,COMMA everyday .PERIOD 
And then i wrote a post about a banjo .PERIOD 
And my husband -- this is my husband who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me ,COMMA you cannot buy a banjo .PERIOD 
And those people who know me understood my joke .PERIOD 
How much money does he spend on beer in a year .PERIOD 
And then i got people saying ,COMMA leave him .PERIOD 
And why are they reading this .PERIOD 
This is not science .PERIOD But this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved ,COMMA and how we can trace our line .PERIOD 
This is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ,COMMA to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are sharing .PERIOD These personal stories -- this is an amazing thing .PERIOD 
And -- and so i printed out her -- or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service .PERIOD And even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD

And that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina .PERIOD 
They're coming together that could be tuna sex -- and there it is .PERIOD 
So from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up .PERIOD And in this map ,COMMA you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging .PERIOD 
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey .PERIOD 
We just need to put it together .PERIOD 
We have the technology that's shown us where it is .PERIOD 
Hi there ,COMMA i'm hasan .PERIOD I'm an artist .PERIOD 
Basically this is the fbi offices in tampa ,COMMA where i spent six months of my life -- back and forth ,COMMA not six months continuously .PERIOD

So you can see delta <NUM> ,COMMA going from kansas city to atlanta .PERIOD 
This was on delta <NUM> :COLON going from jfk to san francisco .PERIOD 
These are the airports that i hang out in ,COMMA because i like airports .PERIOD 
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent and putting it all together .PERIOD 
This is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was .PERIOD 
And then sometimes you get this .PERIOD 
So there's multiple databases .PERIOD 
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations ,COMMA empty gas stations .PERIOD 
At <NUM> pm ,COMMA was this one at <NUM> pm .PERIOD Was this one .PERIOD 
Every few moments i shoot the image .PERIOD 
So by me ,COMMA putting all this information out there ,COMMA what i'm basically telling you is ,COMMA i'm telling you everything .PERIOD 
And the reason their information has any value is well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD 
And by me ,COMMA cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you the information that the fbi has has no value .PERIOD So thus devaluing their currency .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA i'm glad that i'm completely obsolete .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD Why are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK

There's a about a tenfold difference ,COMMA there ,COMMA log scale up the side .PERIOD 
But it goes from about <NUM> to <NUM> people in prison .PERIOD 
Basically it's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons .PERIOD Or is there no relationship between the two .PERIOD 
One is that ,COMMA in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones .PERIOD And the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan .PERIOD 
It's not just one or two things that go wrong .PERIOD It's most things .PERIOD 
I am not talking about perfect equality .PERIOD I'm talking about what exists in rich ,COMMA developed market democracies .PERIOD 
It also leads to status insecurity .PERIOD 
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i didn't have that in mind .PERIOD So .PERIOD 
The acid will ruin the gold plating .PERIOD 
Beneath it is a wonderful knife .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA but is it fun ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i type design emotion and my website wasn't first again .PERIOD 
It's so much fun to drive .PERIOD 
And then a psychologist alice isen did this wonderful experiment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here ,COMMA and a string hanging down here .PERIOD 
You .PERIOD Get a little problem .PERIOD You say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA i'll figure it out .PERIOD 
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD 
Behavioral is subconscious you're unaware of it .PERIOD 
Almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD 
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line .PERIOD 
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment .PERIOD 
The other neat thing .PERIOD 
So that's the new me .PERIOD 
The graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully .PERIOD 
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms .PERIOD 
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was <NUM> percent ,COMMA and let's say took that up to <NUM> percent -- that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD 
The last question is what everybody said ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office .PERIOD Can you show me how to do it ?QUESTIONMARK And then somebody taught him .PERIOD 
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad .PERIOD 
I left the computer there with lots of cds -- i didn't have any internet -- and came back three months later .PERIOD 
And as soon as they saw me ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD 
So i said ,COMMA but how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK 
So then i measured ,COMMA and they were using <NUM> english words with each other -- mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage -- words like exit ,COMMA stop ,COMMA find ,COMMA save that kind of thing ,COMMA not only to do with the computer ,COMMA but in their day-to-day conversations .PERIOD 
This is the himalayas up in the north ,COMMA very cold .PERIOD 
I want to just cut this short ,COMMA we did this over and over again .PERIOD 
So if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves including intelligence .PERIOD 
But we got a clean learning curve ,COMMA almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .PERIOD 
I'll leave it at that ,COMMA because ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it sort of says it all .PERIOD Doesn't it .PERIOD 
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital ,COMMA automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant ,COMMA minimally invasive ,COMMA connected and self-organized .PERIOD 
And it's about rediscovering idealism .PERIOD In all of that wreckage .PERIOD 
I negotiated with saddam's diplomats at the un .PERIOD 
I'd already served in germany ,COMMA norway various other places .PERIOD But i was posted to new york to serve on the un .PERIOD Security council for the british delegation .PERIOD 
And there i dealt with things like the middle east peace process ,COMMA the lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish -- but ,COMMA above all ,COMMA my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD 
I decided to take a sabbatical .PERIOD In fact ,COMMA at the new school ,COMMA bruce .PERIOD 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff .PERIOD 
But in a way ,COMMA i've got used to the sensation of it .PERIOD 
A lot of my friends were still in it .PERIOD 
It was anarchy .PERIOD 
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy ,COMMA to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street .PERIOD 
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the final status process of kosovo .PERIOD 
And i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government .PERIOD 
If they can't do it ,COMMA who's left to deal with it .PERIOD 
So we will be bringing darfuri rebel groups .PERIOD The northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from aceh and awful long ,COMMA laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .PERIOD 
That is the politics of the 21st century .PERIOD And in a way ,COMMA independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation ,COMMA that change that is happening to all of us .PERIOD 
Now today we're not talking about good and bad tv .PERIOD 
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
Is television literally functioning as our conscience ,COMMA tempting us and rewarding us ,COMMA at the same time .PERIOD 
We surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for <NUM> years -- a thousand shows .PERIOD 
Viewers had responded dramatically .PERIOD 
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say ,COMMA my god ,COMMA i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war about the presidency through television .PERIOD 
It can change us .PERIOD 
That's mapped against the red dot ,COMMA unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic .PERIOD 
We had the bursting of the tech bubble .PERIOD 
I can vote you off the island .PERIOD 
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive ,COMMA dominant tv .PERIOD Mom .PERIOD 
Maude :COLON findlay :COLON the epitome of the irreverent 1970s ,COMMA who tackled abortion divorce ,COMMA even menopause on tv .PERIOD 
Murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood .PERIOD 
This era's mom :COLON bree van de kamp .PERIOD 
So here's the metaphor i'm offering today .PERIOD 
Previous to this time ,COMMA i was very selfish and self-righteous .PERIOD 
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving .PERIOD 
But here's the weirdest place of all war .PERIOD 
I passes insensibly into a we ,COMMA my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA profane is the opposite of sacred .PERIOD 
It just means ordinary or common .PERIOD 
Durkheim ,COMMA believed that anything ,COMMA that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .PERIOD 
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind .PERIOD 
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me is the staircase .PERIOD A feature of our evolutionary design .PERIOD 
Or is it a bug ?QUESTIONMARK A mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- jill has a stroke ,COMMA and she has this religious experience .PERIOD It's just a mistake .PERIOD 
There's a mutation in the gene ,COMMA and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .PERIOD 
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens ,COMMA from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters .PERIOD 
And pretty soon ,COMMA the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms .PERIOD 
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are .PERIOD 
We're bees .PERIOD We busted out of the hive during the enlightenment .PERIOD 
We unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort .PERIOD 
What's missing .PERIOD 
And that gives me hope ,COMMA because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD 
Every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
There was no more space in the house .PERIOD So i went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience and about <NUM> dollars and some recycled materials i built this space .PERIOD 
There was enough space .PERIOD And i had control ,COMMA which was very important .PERIOD 
He won the silver medal for ireland .PERIOD In the <NUM> olympics ,COMMA and he trains in this space ,COMMA he trains other people .PERIOD 
Museum ,COMMA quality .PERIOD 
I had requested slides ,COMMA kind of adamantly ,COMMA up till the -- pretty much last few days .PERIOD But was denied access to a slide projector .PERIOD 
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical ,COMMA situated next to each other .PERIOD 
So here's the first door ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you get the message .PERIOD 
This is for a book by metropolis .PERIOD 
When i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it .PERIOD He said ,COMMA no .PERIOD He said ,COMMA he didn't believe it was the end of print .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere .PERIOD And spiders .PERIOD 
And i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
Got no way of tracking it .PERIOD So i could be totally wrong .PERIOD 
I don't have the site ;SEMICOLON it's just the piece itself .PERIOD 
I found out that's very true ,COMMA working on this campaign worldwide .PERIOD 
But anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads i was most pleased with ,COMMA because they were all elaborately art-directed ,COMMA and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer .PERIOD 
In germany ,COMMA they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to ,COMMA because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference .PERIOD 
So i understand their logic ,COMMA i totally disagree with it .PERIOD I think it's a very small-minded approach .PERIOD The world is certainly much more global .PERIOD And i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know .PERIOD 
Article on bryan ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in dingbat .PERIOD 
It's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting .PERIOD There was something more enticing .PERIOD If that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than time or newsweek .PERIOD 
It ,COMMA did not let up .PERIOD 
There were a lot of orphans made this day ,COMMA and here's a dead body being brought out .PERIOD 
This is my desktop .PERIOD 
This is -- i like found art .PERIOD Hand lettering's coming back in a big way .PERIOD And i thought ,COMMA this was a great example of both .PERIOD 
But i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back .PERIOD 
And i remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot ,COMMA and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a <NUM> to <NUM> percent chance of death on the job .PERIOD 
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about .PERIOD 
Before that obviously technology didn't exist .PERIOD But obviously it did .PERIOD 
But it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD So i'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i think ,COMMA once we ask that question ,COMMA we have to go back actually to life ,COMMA because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology far back ,COMMA i think we come back to life at some point .PERIOD 
Brian !EXCLAMATIONMARK Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth .PERIOD 
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life .PERIOD 
And the last thing i bring back this ,COMMA nudibranch .PERIOD 
And so the general long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five :COLON ubiquity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD Now ,COMMA i took that and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
That we see there's a general hammer ,COMMA and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD 
There's obviously diversity ,COMMA huge numbers of things .PERIOD 
So the major trends in technology ,COMMA evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution ;SEMICOLON the same drives that we see towards ubiquity ,COMMA towards diversity ,COMMA towards socialization ,COMMA towards complexity .PERIOD That is maybe not a big surprise .PERIOD Because if we map out say ,COMMA the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD 
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about <NUM> of them .PERIOD 
But the most interesting aspect about this is that ,COMMA if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made .PERIOD That does not happen in biology .PERIOD 
And when we take that ,COMMA we take this idea of what culture is doing ,COMMA and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again ,COMMA in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens .PERIOD 
So all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically the evolution of evolvability .PERIOD 
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking ,COMMA the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game .PERIOD 
And each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones .PERIOD 
That's what technology wants .PERIOD 
I'm going my gosh .PERIOD I had never seen anything like this in my life .PERIOD 
And you walk up to the front of the tank ,COMMA then you realize that these animals all have different personalities .PERIOD Some of them would hold their ground ,COMMA others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks ,COMMA and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal .PERIOD 
And what i learned in school though was really beneficial .PERIOD 
If you're a wildlife filmmaker and you're going out into the field to film animals especially behavior ,COMMA it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are how they work .PERIOD And you know ,COMMA a bit about their behaviors .PERIOD 
So we created a way to find out ,COMMA and i got my first look at that famous beak in action .PERIOD 
And octopus are they live in all the oceans .PERIOD 
And as you go deeper ,COMMA that lovely ,COMMA blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender .PERIOD And after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black .PERIOD 
But we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about <NUM> percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which i think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD 
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart .PERIOD Creating a rift valley .PERIOD 
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing .PERIOD 
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every <NUM> or <NUM> years all along the ridge .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA encouragingly ,COMMA i've seen just the opposite .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA how it happened ,COMMA is the local community ,COMMA galvanized .PERIOD 
And these problems are so large and global .PERIOD And it's just overwhelming .PERIOD 
My answer to that is ,COMMA don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world .PERIOD 
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment like those people changed the health of that bay .PERIOD 
I was afraid of womanhood .PERIOD 
Not that i'm not afraid now .PERIOD But i've learned to pretend .PERIOD 
I've learned to be flexible .PERIOD 
Back in the '50s and '60s ,COMMA when i was growing up ,COMMA little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft .PERIOD And we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA my mother was different .PERIOD 
And i just ate it up .PERIOD 
Because women are on the ground floor ,COMMA and we know the traditions .PERIOD So ,COMMA well we can bring a different voice to the table .PERIOD 
And then also my family was in chaos ,COMMA and i drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together ,COMMA with laughter .PERIOD 
But i feel blessed to be able to work with them .PERIOD 
Two hundred years ago ,COMMA the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .PERIOD 
It's now more than <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Now listen to this every week for the foreseeable future until <NUM> ,COMMA every week more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD 
However cities despite having this negative aspect to them ,COMMA are also the solution .PERIOD 
So we have this kind of dual nature .PERIOD 
That's the quest .PERIOD 
So here's two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem .PERIOD 
We use them metaphorically -- the dna of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city and so on -- is that just bullshit ,COMMA metaphorical bullshit .PERIOD Or is there serious substance to it .PERIOD 
And if that is the case ,COMMA how come that it's very hard to kill a city .PERIOD 
You could drop an atom bomb on a city .PERIOD And ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA it's surviving .PERIOD 
This is just a tiny range ,COMMA actually it's us mammals .PERIOD We're one of these .PERIOD 
Rat that's a rat -- could have been you .PERIOD 
We're all pretty much the same .PERIOD 
And you see ,COMMA you're very familiar with this .PERIOD 
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe ,COMMA there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD 
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale .PERIOD 
And you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD 
And here's the summary of what i'm saying .PERIOD 
Heart rates are slower .PERIOD You live longer .PERIOD Diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA it is which says that the bigger you are ,COMMA the more you have per capita .PERIOD Unlike biology -- higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita more crime per capita .PERIOD 
See companies ,COMMA they scale .PERIOD 
There it is ,COMMA after some little fluctuations at the beginning ,COMMA when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully .PERIOD 
But you notice ,COMMA i've cheated because i've only gone up to '<NUM> .PERIOD 
And i put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves .PERIOD 
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ?QUESTIONMARK And they know what to do with it .PERIOD 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned ,COMMA and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity .PERIOD When my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school ,COMMA and even when i was in school and to a moment ,COMMA when we have information surplus .PERIOD 
It asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail process learn from .PERIOD 
Ask them to go to places to see things for themselves ,COMMA to actually experience the learning to play ,COMMA to inquire .PERIOD 
This is one of my favorite photos ,COMMA because this was taken on tuesday .PERIOD When i asked the students to go to the polls .PERIOD 
There are words that we're truly afraid of .PERIOD 
This was an issue from <NUM> that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .PERIOD 
Regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did .PERIOD A story about regenerative medicine .PERIOD Not too long ago .PERIOD 
And you can basically see that the richer a country is ,COMMA the older the people are within it .PERIOD 
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
In <NUM> ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the us .PERIOD 
This is age versus cost of health care .PERIOD 
This video ,COMMA i think ,COMMA gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically .PERIOD 
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .PERIOD 
In a child ,COMMA before the age of about six months ,COMMA if they lose their fingertip in an accident ,COMMA they'll re-grow their fingertip .PERIOD 
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .PERIOD 
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling .PERIOD 
This is a horse .PERIOD The horse is not in pain .PERIOD 
After treatment ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
He chills the dish ;SEMICOLON it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .PERIOD 
It's the coolest stuff .PERIOD 
In this case at the end of the bypass operation ,COMMA you're going to see the stem cells from the patient .PERIOD That were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .PERIOD 
This was a randomized trial .PERIOD 
There go the cells .PERIOD 
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet ,COMMA but i think very soon will be .PERIOD 
So you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck .PERIOD 
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .PERIOD 
In the united states ,COMMA we've had a somewhat different approach .PERIOD 
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .PERIOD 
And these tedsters are -- you know ,COMMA as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world .PERIOD 
And what could i possibly have to say ,COMMA that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA my characters ,COMMA like the ones in my shows ,COMMA allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD 
What i should tell you -- what i should tell you ,COMMA is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color ,COMMA if you look at her .PERIOD 
Frankly ,COMMA i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
So many others ,COMMA you see ,COMMA they're just wonderful .PERIOD 
But anyway ,COMMA i should have started by saying ,COMMA just how lucky i feel .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA your parents must be very proud .PERIOD 
The point is ,COMMA i'm happy .PERIOD Somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA happy continued .PERIOD Success .PERIOD 
Sorry ,COMMA this is such a wonderful opportunity .PERIOD And everything to be here right now .PERIOD 
My name is noraida ,COMMA and i'm just -- i'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you're doing ,COMMA and everything like that .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA you could say ,COMMA i grew up in the capital of dominican republic ,COMMA otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .PERIOD 
And i think he's mexican ,COMMA so that's -- honestly that's close enough for me ,COMMA right now .PERIOD So -- i just -- i'm sorry .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD So ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA what i was trying to say is that i really love ted .PERIOD 
Like it's -- i can't get over this right now .PERIOD 
So basically ,COMMA like da bomb -- what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does is basically .PERIOD We try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise ,COMMA and who also happen to be mothers like me .PERIOD 
I come from a multicultural family .PERIOD 
And we were only <NUM> years old ,COMMA so it was not appropriate .PERIOD 
Although you know it was wonderful .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i just wanted to quickly say ,COMMA good evening .PERIOD 
But when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA first ,COMMA i don't know that ,COMMA you know -- before two years ago ,COMMA you would not find me in front of an audience of people ,COMMA much less like this .PERIOD Because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that ,COMMA as an immigrant ,COMMA i do not have good english skills for speaking .PERIOD 
But that's where we had some problems .PERIOD 
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that .PERIOD 
So i always teach my kids to respect american ideas ,COMMA but i told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay .PERIOD She is just confused by this american problem .PERIOD 
Thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD 
Finished university education .PERIOD Got a medical degree .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
But critical poverty ,COMMA this slide ,COMMA is from a presentation i gave not that long ago .PERIOD Gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world ,COMMA in terms of health care .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA i'm sorry if it upsets some of you ,COMMA but i think you need to see this .PERIOD That's the floor ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because it's scary and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's mike mike ,COMMA comes out from mississippi .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA that's one of the problems we have in nigeria .PERIOD And in africa ,COMMA generally .PERIOD 
It looks like all these americans are here .PERIOD And yes ,COMMA one brit .PERIOD And he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's british actually ,COMMA and he's actually nigerian .PERIOD I just thought about that .PERIOD 
We eventually got it working ,COMMA is the truth .PERIOD But it was one of these even older than the one you saw .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD Doesn't matter .PERIOD It worked .PERIOD 
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's not new .PERIOD What we're doing is applying this technology to it .PERIOD 
These are members of my graduating class .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA i get a call last year ,COMMA and then i have to go up after .PERIOD Jj .PERIOD Abrams .PERIOD 
Hollywood gathers around power tables ,COMMA and the valley gathers around power tables .PERIOD 
But i'm actually here today to tell a story .PERIOD 
And what he said was he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done ,COMMA the things that he wanted to with his life .PERIOD 
But for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD 
I went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers ,COMMA to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources .PERIOD 
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a ted -- brings so many powerful connections or through the world forum on social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year .PERIOD 
So in <NUM> ,COMMA i started to make my way around los angeles ,COMMA to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement .PERIOD 
One of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was the streets of hollywood ,COMMA are littered with the carcasses of people like you ,COMMA who think you're going to come to this town and make movies .PERIOD 
One of these films in particular ,COMMA called north country ,COMMA was actually kind of a box office disaster .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed ,COMMA sued her employer ,COMMA led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women act and others .PERIOD 
At that point ,COMMA i thought i knew something about global warming .PERIOD 
And we have <NUM> films in production right now and dozens ,COMMA others in development .PERIOD 
And one thing that i've learned is that there's never one right way to make change .PERIOD 
And i can imagine ,COMMA if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in <NUM> years might read something like these new aids cases in africa ,COMMA fall to zero us ,COMMA imports its last barrel of oil -- -- israelis and palestinians ,COMMA celebrate <NUM> years of peaceful .PERIOD Coexistence .PERIOD 
And i believe that working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen .PERIOD 
The next day ,COMMA all the artists ,COMMA were invited to join mandela in robben island where he was going to give a conference to the world's press standing in front of his former prison cell .PERIOD 
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one i wear .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
I've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv .PERIOD 
I tell her story to everyone ,COMMA because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans .PERIOD 
I think that's fair to say :COLON it's almost everyone in the hall .PERIOD 
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .PERIOD 
And their decisions about software coding ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA design terms of service all act as a kind of law :COLON that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD 
The reality is that ,COMMA even in democratic societies today we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .PERIOD 
This is a map of social networks worldwide ,COMMA and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you ,COMMA like the way ,COMMA facebook manages .PERIOD Its service .PERIOD 
In plain english .PERIOD That means censorship and surveillance of their users .PERIOD 
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Comparable in its own very peculiar way ,COMMA to the achievements of microsoft or google .PERIOD 
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their <NUM> makeover .PERIOD 
And so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen ,COMMA by talking to victims ,COMMA by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .PERIOD 
Now organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business .PERIOD 
And it is this :COLON western desire to consume ,COMMA that is the primary driver of international organized crime .PERIOD 
And as a consequence of this trade ,COMMA britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue .PERIOD 
So what were these guys doing with all the money ?QUESTIONMARK They were making .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD 
This one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central british columbia ,COMMA where i photographed it .PERIOD 
What they've done is ,COMMA they've shifted their operations .PERIOD 
People don't smoke as much dope ,COMMA or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession .PERIOD 
And so as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection .PERIOD 
It's such a large conference .PERIOD 
Mark :COLON serfaas :COLON it's pretty cool .PERIOD Huh ?QUESTIONMARK Pursuing happiness ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean -- no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA like in the ted sense .PERIOD 
<NUM> -- am i good .PERIOD 
And my name ,COMMA and it would tell me ,COMMA and i have to tell you right now .PERIOD This is an unadulterated piece of software .PERIOD This is a real internet browser .PERIOD And this is an actual google site ,COMMA and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD 
Am i feeling lucky .PERIOD 
Ze frank :COLON oh ,COMMA amazing .PERIOD 
Needless to say ,COMMA i was able to leave my job .PERIOD 
Four years later ,COMMA i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don't know .PERIOD And it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
And that was embarrassing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is incredible .PERIOD This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it .PERIOD It's just gorgeous .PERIOD 
None of the haikus were written by the same person .PERIOD And in fact ,COMMA no line was -- you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .PERIOD 
It dances to music .PERIOD Lotte reiniger :COLON an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s ,COMMA that started doing more elaborate things .PERIOD 
Chris anderson :COLON ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD Mr .PERIOD Ze frank .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this is <NUM> .PERIOD 
So i'm going to talk about it .PERIOD 
We get the geneticists ,COMMA keeping ,COMMA on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD 
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology ,COMMA or behavior .PERIOD 
Professor tobias came over from south africa and spoke to university college .PERIOD London .PERIOD 
You've believed it through generations .PERIOD 
So that is what they have done .PERIOD Now .PERIOD 
Aaron filler from harvard said ,COMMA isn't it time ?QUESTIONMARK We stopped talking about selective pressures .PERIOD 
He kept it to himself for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And at that time it became set in stone .PERIOD The aquatic theory should be dumped .PERIOD With the ufos and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science .PERIOD 
I suggested it ,COMMA and people said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
Peals of merry laughter .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA crazy .PERIOD Woman :COLON she's off again .PERIOD She'll say ,COMMA anything won't .PERIOD She .PERIOD 
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD 
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD 
There is only one circumstance in which they always ,COMMA all of them walk on two legs .PERIOD And that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD 
David attenborough thinks it's significant as the possible beginning of our bipedalism .PERIOD 
In the whale ,COMMA it's complete no fat inside at all .PERIOD All in blubber outside .PERIOD 
We can speak .PERIOD 
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver .PERIOD And you can see that ,COMMA compared with gorilla ,COMMA we are halfway to being shaped like a fish .PERIOD 
There is nothing there .PERIOD 
I don't believe it .PERIOD 
There was professor tobias .PERIOD He's come over .PERIOD 
Daniel dennett :COLON he's come over .PERIOD 
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD 
I can tell you that in three words .PERIOD 
The textbooks ,COMMA don't mention it .PERIOD 
And it's pretty simple .PERIOD 
Everybody's got one -- all of you .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within .PERIOD 
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards .PERIOD 
When i meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do i carve a message in the snow .PERIOD 
But really the most satisfying experience i've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship .PERIOD 
And just as with the wall ,COMMA how i wanted to be more wall-like ,COMMA with this project ,COMMA i'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .PERIOD 
So how do you do that .PERIOD 
That doesn't move .PERIOD 
Here's my promise to you ,COMMA if you are consistent and do this ,COMMA within three months ,COMMA the elected official will start calling you .PERIOD When that issue comes up and say ,COMMA what do you think .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand ,COMMA there's a dangerous end to them ,COMMA and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness .PERIOD 
If you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing .PERIOD 
If they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA do you have the original .PERIOD 
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read .PERIOD 
So what your letter means ,COMMA i've got to tell you ,COMMA we are all in a party ,COMMA and political officials are the pinatas .PERIOD 
Living systems are ,COMMA in constant conversation with the natural world ,COMMA through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .PERIOD 
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another ,COMMA either through the production or the absorption of energy .PERIOD 
Now that's exactly the kind of process that i'm interested in .PERIOD When we're thinking about sustainable materials .PERIOD 
It is able to move around its environment .PERIOD 
It can follow chemical gradients .PERIOD 
It can undergo complex reactions .PERIOD Some of which are happily architectural .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding .PERIOD This skin .PERIOD 
The protocells can actually move away from the light .PERIOD 
So this is really interesting .PERIOD Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD 
This is a river .PERIOD 
The reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details .PERIOD 
But as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned .PERIOD And in <NUM> montana passed its first water law .PERIOD 
There's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint .PERIOD 
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint ?QUESTIONMARK That can have serious effects on the ecosystem .PERIOD 
He doesn't lose the water right .PERIOD He just chooses to apply that right ,COMMA or some portion of it to the stream .PERIOD Instead of to the land .PERIOD 
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream .PERIOD 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science .PERIOD 
Compassion is fun .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA to create the conditions for global compassion ,COMMA all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD 
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD 
And they ,COMMA according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders .PERIOD 
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits ,COMMA tones down .PERIOD What i call the excessive self-obsession that's in us ,COMMA therefore creating the conditions for humility .PERIOD 
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in .PERIOD 
That's one .PERIOD 
The second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD 
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace .PERIOD 
I found this to be true ,COMMA both on the individual level ,COMMA and at a corporate level .PERIOD 
And what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .PERIOD 
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst .PERIOD But in fact ,COMMA <NUM> percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD 
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law .PERIOD 
In burundi ,COMMA i walked into a prison and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy ,COMMA it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .PERIOD 
And when i walked up to the prison director ,COMMA i said ,COMMA you've got to let her out .PERIOD 
So the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD 
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .PERIOD 
And the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery ,COMMA or end apartheid .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's bars .PERIOD And by the time that vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger ,COMMA your head gets bigger .PERIOD 
So he would come to the first bar ,COMMA the second bar and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really ,COMMA slowly move his head .PERIOD So he could fit through and come back third ,COMMA second ,COMMA first .PERIOD And he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .PERIOD 
And i will do the one thing that i can do .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
We were in queens .PERIOD We were building the big big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in midtown .PERIOD So we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks .PERIOD 
But it's not only that .PERIOD 
In italy in milan ,COMMA especially contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place .PERIOD 
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no work .PERIOD And leisure can be together .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the tv dinner of <NUM> .PERIOD 
I would like instead to talk about how great some designers are .PERIOD 
It's a long story because it started before <NUM> ,COMMA and it was called emergency .PERIOD 
So designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD 
This is cindy van den bremen .PERIOD Who is a dutch designer ?QUESTIONMARK That's done this series of capsters .PERIOD 
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight ,COMMA so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror .PERIOD So the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self .PERIOD 
Design really looks upon the whole world .PERIOD And it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD 
And it was really interesting because i was the last speaker .PERIOD And before me ,COMMA there were people that were really talking about luxury ,COMMA and i didn't want to be a party pooper .PERIOD But at the same time ,COMMA i felt that i had to kind of ,COMMA bring back the discourse to reality .PERIOD 
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously ,COMMA just like the rhythm of our life in the past <NUM> years .PERIOD So i'm not sure anymore .PERIOD What the wavelength is .PERIOD 
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful .PERIOD 
So africa is a complex continent full of contradictions .PERIOD As you can see .PERIOD 
And i want to tell you that this is my story ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's the story of many of the africans who are here .PERIOD 
And my father said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA listen .PERIOD 
So we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege ,COMMA and because my father didn't have the right last name ,COMMA he was treated like dirt .PERIOD 
But the money ran out .PERIOD 
You .PERIOD Don't see the blogger .PERIOD You don't see the harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
And you didn't know about the windmill .PERIOD You know .PERIOD 
And i was just moved .PERIOD 
So what is to be done .PERIOD 
And this is an example .PERIOD You know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that .PERIOD 
So we need to start getting better .PERIOD 
And going back to the point i was trying to make .PERIOD This is the swahili ,COMMA wikipedia .PERIOD 
Swahili is spoken by about <NUM> million people in east africa .PERIOD 
So that's a start ,COMMA and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD 
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms ,COMMA in dc .PERIOD Covington and burling six figures .PERIOD 
What are they doing .PERIOD 
Practically ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA when i was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed .PERIOD So i was supporting her .PERIOD 
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad .PERIOD 
An example ,COMMA this man changed my life .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA i want to be a lawyer .PERIOD 
And i'm like because i'm here ,COMMA and it's cheap ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i kind of like pittsburgh .PERIOD 
I was also building something called the copenhagen wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful .PERIOD Beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab .PERIOD 
This is a place where my friend ,COMMA abhishek sen was interning .PERIOD 
And that's his actual photograph .PERIOD 
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia .PERIOD 
But this is not available in parol .PERIOD 
But fundamentally ,COMMA what i believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia .PERIOD 
And when i walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA i saw your talk live-streamed .PERIOD 
So of course ,COMMA the only thing i could think of to say at that point was yeah ,COMMA me .PERIOD Neither .PERIOD 
Why did you bring this up ?QUESTIONMARK Have you lost your mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i said ,COMMA i'm just thinking about it a little bit .PERIOD 
And my life did end when that happened .PERIOD 
The first is :COLON vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD 
The majority of people .PERIOD 
I define vulnerability as emotional risk ,COMMA exposure .PERIOD Uncertainty .PERIOD 
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .PERIOD 
So when i became vulnerability ted like an action figure -- like ninja barbie .PERIOD But i'm vulnerability ted -- i thought i'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability .PERIOD 
But in surviving this last year ,COMMA i was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD 
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .PERIOD 
Here's why .PERIOD 
I can't wait to tell people this .PERIOD 
The credit goes to the man in the arena ,COMMA whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .PERIOD 
That's what life is about ,COMMA about daring greatly ,COMMA about being in the arena .PERIOD 
I know your dad never paid attention .PERIOD Even when you made cfo .PERIOD 
Shame drives two big tapes -- never good enough .PERIOD And if you can talk it out of that ,COMMA one ,COMMA who do you think you are .PERIOD 
It's uncomfortable ,COMMA but it's adaptive .PERIOD 
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA that's convenient .PERIOD 
So i started interviewing men and asking questions .PERIOD 
If you put shame in a petri dish ,COMMA it needs three things to grow exponentially :COLON secrecy ,COMMA silence and judgment .PERIOD 
If you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy .PERIOD It can't survive .PERIOD 
And i know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because i think i did it my whole life ,COMMA and think to myself ,COMMA i'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i'm bulletproof .PERIOD And when i'm perfect .PERIOD 
We want you to go in .PERIOD 
So what would be better [than] to use the herring gull in its freedom ,COMMA circling and swooping over the sea ?QUESTIONMARK And [to] use this as a role model .PERIOD 
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a smartbird .PERIOD 
We have to turn it ,COMMA go up and go down .PERIOD 
Bruno :COLON giussani :COLON markus !EXCLAMATIONMARK I think that we should fly it once more .PERIOD 
I think ,COMMA first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .PERIOD 
Today we're reaching not even <NUM> percent of them .PERIOD 
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan .PERIOD 
It is ourselves .PERIOD We are healing .PERIOD 
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it .PERIOD 
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating ,COMMA and then you see on the other side .PERIOD Another patient is getting ready .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .PERIOD 
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things .PERIOD 
And then over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out .PERIOD 
So we're really comparing apples to apples .PERIOD 
So i want to end my talk leaving ,COMMA this thought and challenge to you .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD V .PERIOD When you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation .PERIOD 
So the question is :COLON how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical .PERIOD 
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .PERIOD 
Now mass is the first thing .PERIOD The second thing that's shape .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA it's a mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA and this one can change its shape .PERIOD 
As humans ,COMMA we are social ,COMMA we are empathic ,COMMA and that's great .PERIOD 
So that's very intuitive ,COMMA and that's what we want .PERIOD 
The brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of california .PERIOD So it's the same now .PERIOD <NUM> years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up <NUM> percent per capita .PERIOD 
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on .PERIOD 
It's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD 
People are following opportunity into town .PERIOD 
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity ,COMMA not the working slums .PERIOD They help create prosperity .PERIOD 
These people are valuable as a group .PERIOD 
You look at that lane on the right .PERIOD 
They're doing it through an outlaw thing .PERIOD The informal economy .PERIOD 
And young people in brand new cities ,COMMA they're inventing ,COMMA doing new things in the south .PERIOD 
Climate is a profoundly complex ,COMMA nonlinear system ,COMMA full of runaway positive feedbacks ,COMMA hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points .PERIOD 
We're going to keep being surprised ,COMMA and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .PERIOD 
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear ,COMMA the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can .PERIOD 
It's interesting ,COMMA say ,COMMA to take a 25-megawatt ,COMMA <NUM> million watts .PERIOD And you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva ,COMMA which is <NUM> <NUM> billion watts .PERIOD 
These things are way smaller .PERIOD They're much more adaptable .PERIOD 
This is a list of them .PERIOD 
And as those events keep happening ,COMMA we're going to say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can we do about that really .PERIOD 
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this shouldn't come as a surprise to us .PERIOD 
As with bp ,COMMA the hole does get plugged at least temporarily .PERIOD But not before exacting a tremendous price .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident ,COMMA and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks .PERIOD In the future .PERIOD 
The gulf of mexico is a very big ocean .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA the ocean is big .PERIOD She can take it .PERIOD 
A new bubble will replace the old one .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA looking at these images ,COMMA it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation ,COMMA which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england .PERIOD 
An escape hatch .PERIOD Has been reached .PERIOD 
Ok ?QUESTIONMARK Dh ?QUESTIONMARK Oh ,COMMA all ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
I'm now pushing my luck .PERIOD I'm skipping right to six cups .PERIOD 
Also three with his left .PERIOD

If i do like you ,COMMA i give you one cow and many other things ,COMMA and we become friends .PERIOD 
Yab ,COMMA you can also go to the website answer -- respond to the questions also .PERIOD 
Now i am going to speak to you about my movie .PERIOD 
Video :COLON this earth is four and a half billion years old .PERIOD 
There is no business on this movie .PERIOD 
Merci beaucoup .PERIOD I love you .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we have a whole or team general ,COMMA anesthesia ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA and another doctor across from me .PERIOD 
There will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole .PERIOD 
This was done under local anesthesia ,COMMA as an outpatient .PERIOD 
In the last decade ,COMMA there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases such as heart disease ,COMMA vascular disease .PERIOD Orthopedics ,COMMA tissue engineering ,COMMA even in neurology to treat parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD 
We've just come out ,COMMA we're commercializing ,COMMA this year ,COMMA generation <NUM> of the marrow miner .PERIOD 
That was all done on a machine that looks like this .PERIOD 
So now what we do is we take a genome ,COMMA we make maybe <NUM> copies of it .PERIOD We cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads ,COMMA and then we sequence them massively .PERIOD Parallel .PERIOD 
And he sequenced .PERIOD He took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin and cancerous bone marrow ,COMMA and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks .PERIOD No big deal .PERIOD 
And so they were given l-dopa .PERIOD And their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD 
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced .PERIOD 
Thankfully ,COMMA i was able to answer a and i say that honestly ,COMMA in case my life insurance agent is listening .PERIOD 
Not hard to imagine my company has software .PERIOD That does this right now .PERIOD 
It can be summed up in a single sentence .PERIOD Everything that can happen ,COMMA does .PERIOD 
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced .PERIOD 
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties ,COMMA and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges .PERIOD 
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles .PERIOD 
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces .PERIOD 
A particle that hasn't been seen yet ,COMMA but we're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles .PERIOD 
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .PERIOD 
The most familiar charge is electric charge .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges :COLON hypercharge :COLON and weak charge .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA this weak force particle and its anti-particle can be created in a collision .PERIOD 
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino .PERIOD And these three still add to zero total charge .PERIOD 
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism .PERIOD 
This particular choice ,COMMA corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in <NUM> .PERIOD 
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen .PERIOD 
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges .PERIOD 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD 
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new .PERIOD 
In <NUM> galileo wrote this nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze ,COMMA is written in the language of mathematics .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA bad for me personally .PERIOD 
In :COLON this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .PERIOD 
As with any large investment ,COMMA it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out .PERIOD 
I try to balance my life ,COMMA equally ,COMMA between physics ,COMMA love and surfing -- my own three charge directions .PERIOD 
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this e8 pattern ,COMMA could be the rest of the picture .PERIOD 
They are more like us than any other living creature .PERIOD And we've heard about that during this ted conference .PERIOD 
Chimpanzees ,COMMA i believe more than any other living creature ,COMMA have helped us to understand that .PERIOD After all ,COMMA there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
There isn't time to go into it ,COMMA but it's including things like tree nurseries methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded .PERIOD Almost desert-like land up in these mountains .PERIOD 
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland ,COMMA so that within two years they can again be productive .PERIOD 
Perhaps build some schoolrooms .PERIOD 
And we've got ,COMMA as is the case around the world ,COMMA about <NUM> percent of all loans returned .PERIOD 
And as a result of this program ,COMMA something's happening for conservation .PERIOD 
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these <NUM> villages ,COMMA instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now tanzanian -- but when we began the tacare program ,COMMA it was a tanzanian team going into the villages .PERIOD 
And everywhere there were these terrible problems .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the kind i'm talking about ,COMMA i'm talking about pollution .PERIOD 
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural ,COMMA industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world ,COMMA seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience .PERIOD 
In many parts of sub-saharan africa .PERIOD The droughts are so much worse .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between ?QUESTIONMARK This extraordinarily clever brain ?QUESTIONMARK The kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify ,COMMA and the human heart talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love ,COMMA and compassion ,COMMA is there some disconnect .PERIOD 
We have compromised their future .PERIOD 
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through ,COMMA and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD 
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife domestic animals ,COMMA as well .PERIOD 
You can't come to a conference like ted and not have hope .PERIOD Can you .PERIOD 
And i mean ,COMMA think of the technologies .PERIOD 
How many of us have children or grandchildren ,COMMA nieces ,COMMA nephews .PERIOD 
People like this are so inspirational .PERIOD 
And i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the roots and shoots program .PERIOD 
And it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people when they are empowered ,COMMA given the opportunity to take action to make the world a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope .PERIOD For tomorrow .PERIOD 
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report .PERIOD The reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you .PERIOD 
You can get video .PERIOD Annotations of the event that you're reading about you can get the latest sports scores ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
I then ,COMMA in the last few years ,COMMA learned about the pacific garbage patch ,COMMA and the gyre .PERIOD 
And the bigger picture is we need to find a way to turn off the faucet .PERIOD 
It's not just that gyre of plastic that i'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .PERIOD 
You put something in a bin ,COMMA and you don't have to think about it again .PERIOD 
And i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source .PERIOD 
But what if it wasn't .PERIOD 
The smallest :COLON bacteria is about <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD 
But i got to thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we were in the middle of a flood zone in bangladesh the water wouldn't look like this .PERIOD 
There ,COMMA we go mind the electrics .PERIOD 
Pop the cartridge out ,COMMA pop a new one in .PERIOD 
About half a cent a day to run .PERIOD

I am the mother of zacarias moussaoui .PERIOD 
My son ,COMMA i don't know where he is .PERIOD 
So that's why i decided to tell my story ,COMMA so that my suffering is something positive for other women .PERIOD 
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .PERIOD 
So if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is something good .PERIOD 
I would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha ,COMMA starting with that day .PERIOD We had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security ,COMMA because it was november <NUM> .PERIOD And ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .PERIOD 
Why did we want to meet her .PERIOD 
And what happened then is we all told our stories ,COMMA and we all connected as human beings .PERIOD 
I never had met someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .PERIOD 
And these are always periods ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA accompanied by turbulence ,COMMA and all too often by blood .PERIOD 
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .PERIOD 
It's also moving vertically .PERIOD 
My guess is for what it's worth ,COMMA is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next <NUM> years <NUM> but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered .PERIOD It has radically changed .PERIOD 
But that's not a usual case in history .PERIOD 
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .PERIOD 
Canning :COLON the great british foreign secretary once said ,COMMA britain has a common interest ,COMMA but no common allies .PERIOD 
At that time ,COMMA the defense of my country was about one thing .PERIOD And one thing only how strong was our army ,COMMA how strong was our air force ,COMMA how strong was our navy ,COMMA and how strong were our allies .PERIOD 
But now one final thing .PERIOD 
Collective security is not enough .PERIOD 
Peace has come to northern ireland ,COMMA because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work .PERIOD 
And so suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .PERIOD 
I started with a poem ,COMMA i'll end with one .PERIOD

False .PERIOD 
It reminds me of my college days .PERIOD 
So to make it to age <NUM> ,COMMA you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle .PERIOD You also have to have won the genetic lottery .PERIOD 
That's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about <NUM> times faster than a 12-year-old person .PERIOD 
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease ,COMMA heart disease ,COMMA cancer and diabetes .PERIOD 
But the real secret ,COMMA i think ,COMMA lies more in the way that they organize their society .PERIOD 
Just look at the advertisements .PERIOD 
One :COLON fifth :COLON the rate of colon and breast cancer ,COMMA big killers here in america .PERIOD 
We're down to one and half right now .PERIOD 
This particular moai .PERIOD These five ladies have been together for <NUM> years .PERIOD

And they have strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time .PERIOD 
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect .PERIOD 
Diets :COLON don't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population .PERIOD 
So when i had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity ,COMMA it was incredible .PERIOD 
You can get eight ,COMMA <NUM> minutes of weightlessness -- how nasa's trained their astronauts for so long .PERIOD 
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now ,COMMA because i don't want to look at me on the screen .PERIOD 
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup ,COMMA where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone .PERIOD 
These micro-machines ,COMMA which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over ,COMMA are self-directed ,COMMA powerful ,COMMA precise ,COMMA accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids .PERIOD 
And so what i'm going to show you is a three-minute reader's ,COMMA digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced ,COMMA it's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years .PERIOD 
And each of us has about <NUM> of these things running around right now ,COMMA inside each one of your <NUM> trillion cells .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA no matter how lazy you feel .PERIOD You're not really intrinsically doing nothing .PERIOD 
And three years ago ,COMMA one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible .PERIOD 
I didn't always succeed .PERIOD 
A friend told me ,COMMA shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert ,COMMA a nationally renowned journalist ,COMMA had been talking about me on national tv .PERIOD 
In my country ,COMMA that was the case in <NUM> .PERIOD 
The women said ,COMMA we agree .PERIOD We'll use pills ,COMMA but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills .PERIOD And we had very ,COMMA very few doctors .PERIOD

We introduced our first microcredit program in <NUM> and the women who organized it said .PERIOD We only want to lend to women who practice family planning .PERIOD 
It's a part of the village development bank .PERIOD It's not a real bank ,COMMA but it's a fund -- microcredit .PERIOD 
And then we thought we'd help america because america's been helping everyone ,COMMA whether they want help or not .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA don't worry come over ,COMMA and i'll do the whole lot of you .PERIOD 
And what happened .PERIOD 
Then aids came along and hit thailand .PERIOD And we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids .PERIOD 
But unfortunately ,COMMA the government was in denial ,COMMA denial denial .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA mechai ,COMMA could you come and join .PERIOD 
He became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold .PERIOD 
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere everywhere .PERIOD 
And then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD 
We all need to help .PERIOD 
And before you can borrow the money ,COMMA you need to be trained .PERIOD 
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty .PERIOD 
And it's a center ,COMMA a focal point for economic and social development .PERIOD 
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection .PERIOD 
In the last <NUM> years i have published a few books .PERIOD But i have lived in anonymity until february of <NUM> .PERIOD When i carried the olympic flag .PERIOD In the winter olympics in italy .PERIOD 
That made me a celebrity .PERIOD Now people recognize me in macy's ,COMMA and my grandchildren think that i'm cool .PERIOD

Once when my daughter ,COMMA paula was in her twenties ,COMMA she said to me that feminism was dated ,COMMA that i should move on .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA for privileged women ,COMMA like my daughter and all of us here today ,COMMA but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world ,COMMA who are still forced into premature marriage ,COMMA prostitution ,COMMA forced labor -- they have children that they don't want ,COMMA or they cannot feed .PERIOD 
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in bangladesh .PERIOD 
She's not licensed for that ;SEMICOLON she has never done it .PERIOD 
The woman's face .PERIOD Looks like a watermelon .PERIOD 
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes .PERIOD 
Jenny is horrified at what she has done .PERIOD But then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation .PERIOD 
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all .PERIOD And they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence ,COMMA and they are constantly threatened by exploitation ,COMMA violence and abuse .PERIOD 
In any war today ,COMMA most of the casualties are civilians ,COMMA mainly women and children .PERIOD They are collateral damage .PERIOD 
I'm talking about men with young minds .PERIOD Of course .PERIOD 
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed by <NUM> .PERIOD 
And when you think that <NUM> percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations .PERIOD It's a grim picture .PERIOD 
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .PERIOD 
But also ,COMMA you have to imagine it full of food .PERIOD 
And if we look at an image of smithfield in <NUM> ,COMMA you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .PERIOD 
It even got built ,COMMA but nothing to do with this vision that howard had .PERIOD 
So i've come up with an alternative ,COMMA which is sitopia from the ancient greek ,COMMA sitos for food ,COMMA and topos for place .PERIOD 
I believe we already live in sitopia .PERIOD 
So if we were to do that ,COMMA what might sitopia look like .PERIOD 
Because without these kinds of people ,COMMA we can't have places like this .PERIOD 
And equally important is the negative version -- don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you .PERIOD 
I sometimes see when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead .PERIOD 
And so we have a choice .PERIOD It seems to me .PERIOD 
And also see that it demands acute intelligence ,COMMA not just a gooey feeling .PERIOD 
In this room ,COMMA all this expertise ,COMMA if we joined it ,COMMA all together ,COMMA we could change the world .PERIOD 
Who knew about extension managers .PERIOD 
Now why would i care about rome ,COMMA particularly .PERIOD 
These are just drawings of rome .PERIOD I get back as often as possible -- i need to .PERIOD 
These are sketches of some of the little details .PERIOD 
Here's a little map ,COMMA and i thought of maps at the beginning .PERIOD Maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome .PERIOD 
Over the spanish steps we go .PERIOD 
She parks her dirigible ,COMMA lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside .PERIOD 
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around .PERIOD And you can see it from ground point of view ,COMMA and from her point of view -- looking in the hole ,COMMA getting a different kind of perspective ,COMMA moving you around the space ,COMMA particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor ,COMMA to the center of the oculus .PERIOD 
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine ,COMMA but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do .PERIOD 
Then i thought ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD What am i doing .PERIOD 
If i do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it ,COMMA you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue .PERIOD 
Pigeon's progress struck me as a catchy title .PERIOD 
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth ,COMMA along the way .PERIOD 
This is something that's a little bit unusual .PERIOD 
This is one of those things i show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective .PERIOD 
I have all the pieces .PERIOD There's santa maria della pace ;SEMICOLON there's a soccer ball ,COMMA there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening .PERIOD So i had to rethink it .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So there's something super interesting about natural systems .PERIOD 
The first two are the macrobot and decibot .PERIOD 
One of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks .PERIOD 
So each chain ,COMMA or each element ,COMMA wants to turn ,COMMA right ,COMMA or left .PERIOD 
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional -- up into this chain ,COMMA completely passively .PERIOD 
At the end of the lecture ,COMMA they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one that's really stuck with me since then .PERIOD 
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria at the time .PERIOD 
As we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about <NUM> percent of the genetic information in your nose ,COMMA doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant animal ,COMMA fungus virus or bacteria .PERIOD 
So can we have the lights off ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK So we can see it .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA not quite not quite perfect -- you see ,COMMA in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark ,COMMA pitch ,COMMA dark .PERIOD 
That's how big and how dark the universe is .PERIOD 
And that is how un-typical this place is .PERIOD 
Now that is knowledge .PERIOD And if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time .PERIOD That is the growth of knowledge .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA how does the solar system -- and our environment in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA one thing that's true about stephen hawking's remark -- i mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong ,COMMA emphasis one thing that's true about it ,COMMA is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD There's no special dispensation ,COMMA no miracles involved .PERIOD It .PERIOD Does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .PERIOD 
One of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD Information processing is computation ,COMMA computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer .PERIOD Without matter .PERIOD 
And the same -- well ,COMMA if we could do that ,COMMA we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence .PERIOD 
And with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars and planets .PERIOD 
And locally there ,COMMA you could build particle accelerators ,COMMA and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
The danger is not at all ,COMMA unprecedented species ,COMMA go extinct .PERIOD All the time .PERIOD 
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure .PERIOD But that's only if we know what to prevent .PERIOD 
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .PERIOD 
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem ,COMMA or problems in general .PERIOD 
And that is ,COMMA i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists .PERIOD 
It's only <NUM> years ago this month ,COMMA when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism ,COMMA that of haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD 
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .PERIOD 
And we started the sorcerer ii expedition ,COMMA where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean ,COMMA every <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
And with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD 
I view that these genes are now .PERIOD Not only the design components of evolution .PERIOD 
Transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code .PERIOD 
We found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult .PERIOD 
And there's only two countries :COLON the us ,COMMA and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents .PERIOD 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully a source of energy ,COMMA environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry .PERIOD 
It was actually a very strange study ,COMMA because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life .PERIOD So it must be ok .PERIOD The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments .PERIOD For the reasons we were doing them .PERIOD 
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us .PERIOD 
In particular check out asia .PERIOD 
Zoom in on haiti ,COMMA in outline here .PERIOD 
But deng xiaoping instinctively understood ,COMMA the importance of offering choices to his people .PERIOD 
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy .PERIOD 
We can go do it over and over again .PERIOD 
We also need the choices for people .PERIOD 
The final thing we need are choices for leaders .PERIOD 
Now when i say that some of you are starting to think well is this just bringing back colonialism .PERIOD 
Let us have a hong kong .PERIOD Nearby .PERIOD 
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well .PERIOD 
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule .PERIOD 
So let me show you why that's wrong .PERIOD 
Take this representation of all of the land .PERIOD 
Their kids can get an education .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what will it take to get started building the first charter cities ,COMMA scaling this ?QUESTIONMARK So we build many more .PERIOD 
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office ,COMMA that people can pledge as collateral .PERIOD

I'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters .PERIOD 
Told me don't eat that marshmallow .PERIOD Because if you wait you're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out .PERIOD 
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this .PERIOD There's saturn and we have been to saturn before -- we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft .PERIOD Traveling across interplanetary space for seven years ,COMMA glided into orbit around saturn ,COMMA in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA just studying the rings alone ,COMMA we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .PERIOD 
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan ,COMMA get broken down ,COMMA and their products join together to make haze particles .PERIOD 
Try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like .PERIOD 
It's cold ,COMMA it's eerie ;SEMICOLON it's misty ,COMMA it might be raining .PERIOD And you might be standing on the shores of lake ,COMMA michigan brimming with paint thinner .PERIOD 
As i said ,COMMA it has a thick extensive atmosphere .PERIOD 
We have instruments on cassini ,COMMA which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere .PERIOD And my camera system is one of them .PERIOD 
They look like they've been pulled apart .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it was -- i mean ,COMMA i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it .PERIOD 
But this is somewhat of a shoreline .PERIOD 
And obviously it landed in one of these flat ,COMMA dark regions ,COMMA and it didn't sink out of sight .PERIOD So it wasn't fluid that we landed in .PERIOD 
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan ,COMMA through these channels that we saw ,COMMA and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .PERIOD 
And i think you would agree that we have found .PERIOD Titan is a remarkable ,COMMA mystical place .PERIOD It's exotic .PERIOD It's alien .PERIOD But yet strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity ,COMMA and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself .PERIOD 
It is a very geologically active body .PERIOD 
Or this .PERIOD 
Really .PERIOD 
We're having trouble feeding six billion today .PERIOD 
When we look at a map of los angeles or london ,COMMA it is hard to believe that as of <NUM> ,COMMA only <NUM> percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .PERIOD

So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .PERIOD 
So beyond spatial memory ,COMMA if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain ,COMMA we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks .PERIOD Like remembering the last time you went to a wedding .PERIOD For example .PERIOD 
Or better ,COMMA how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions .PERIOD

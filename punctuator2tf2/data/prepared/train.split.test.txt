this wasn't scheduled ,COMMA but they went from inner-city boston to pobal in india ,COMMA to secondi-takoradi on ghana's coast to soshanguve in a township in south africa ,COMMA to the far north of norway ,COMMA uncovering ,COMMA or helping uncover ,COMMA for all the attention to the digital divide ,COMMA we would find unused computers in all these places .PERIOD 
a farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify the world ,COMMA not just get information about it on a screen .PERIOD 
that there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in place after place we saw this same progression :COLON that we'd open one of these fab labs ,COMMA where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of .PERIOD 
we didn't think this up ,COMMA that we would get pulled to these places ;SEMICOLON we'd open it .PERIOD the first step was just empowerment .PERIOD 
this is a girl in inner-city boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center .PERIOD 
it goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education informally ,COMMA out of schools .PERIOD in ghana we had set up one of these labs .PERIOD 
there was a girl who insisted we stay late at night -- :COLON kids :COLON i love the fab lab .PERIOD 
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor .PERIOD 
so she insisted on fabbing the board ,COMMA learning how to stuff it ,COMMA learning how to program it .PERIOD she didn't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it ,COMMA but she knew she just had to do it .PERIOD there was something electric about it .PERIOD 
and i've shown this to engineers at big companies ,COMMA and they say they can't do this .PERIOD any one thing she's doing ,COMMA they can do better ,COMMA but it's distributed over many people and many sites and they can't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural ghana is doing .PERIOD 
 :COLON girl :COLON my name is valentina kofi ;SEMICOLON i am eight years old .PERIOD 
i made a stacking board .PERIOD 
then these labs started doing serious problem solving -- instrumentation for agriculture in india ,COMMA steam turbines for energy conversion in ghana ,COMMA high-gain antennas in thin client computers .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA the lab started doing invention .PERIOD 
they invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which ,COMMA as you see up there ,COMMA that's becoming a business -- but their design was better than saul's design at mit ,COMMA so there's now three students at mit doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs .PERIOD 
and i still kept -- so ,COMMA in the last year i've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this ,COMMA and i keep saying ,COMMA but this isn't the real thing .PERIOD 
wait ,COMMA like ,COMMA <NUM> years and then we'll be done .PERIOD 
and i finally got what's been going on .PERIOD this is kernigan and ritchie inventing unix on a pdp .PERIOD 
they were tens of thousands of dollars ,COMMA hard to use ,COMMA but they brought computing down to work groups ,COMMA and everything we do today happened there .PERIOD 
these fab labs are the cost and complexity of a pdp .PERIOD 
the projection of digital fabrication isn't a projection for the future ;SEMICOLON we are now in the pdp era .PERIOD 
we talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then .PERIOD 
it was very chaotic ,COMMA it wasn't ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA clear what was going on .PERIOD 
in the same sense we are now ,COMMA today ,COMMA in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication .PERIOD 
the only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries .PERIOD 
in dc ,COMMA i go to every agency that wants to talk ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON in the bay area ,COMMA i go to every organization you can think of -- they all want to talk about it ,COMMA but it breaks their organizational boundaries .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA it's illegal for them ,COMMA in many cases ,COMMA to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology .PERIOD 
and that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me :COLON it's the social engineering .PERIOD that the lab in far north of norway -- this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are -- the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in .PERIOD 
this isn't a university ;SEMICOLON it's not a company .PERIOD it's essentially a village for invention ;SEMICOLON it's a village for the outliers in society ,COMMA and those have been growing up around these fab labs all around the world .PERIOD 
so this program has split into an ngo foundation ,COMMA a fab foundation to support the scaling ,COMMA a micro vc fund .PERIOD 
the person who runs it nicely describes it as machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses :COLON it's a cross between micro-finance and vc to do fan-out ,COMMA and then the research partnerships back at mit for what's making it possible .PERIOD 
so i'd like to leave you with two thoughts .PERIOD 
there's been a sea change in aid ,COMMA from top-down mega-projects to bottom-up ,COMMA grassroots ,COMMA micro-finance investing in the roots ,COMMA so that everybody's got that that's what works .PERIOD 
but we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects .PERIOD 
computing ,COMMA communication ,COMMA energy for the rest of the planet are these top-down mega-projects .PERIOD 
the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .PERIOD 
i thought that's the projection <NUM> years hence into the future ,COMMA but it's where we are today .PERIOD 
it breaks every organizational boundary we can think of .PERIOD 
the hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering ,COMMA but it's here today .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA finally ,COMMA any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show moore's law ,COMMA but my favorite version -- this is gordon moore's original one from his original paper -- and what's happened is ,COMMA year after year after year ,COMMA we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled ,COMMA and we've scaled and we've scaled ,COMMA and we've scaled and we've scaled ,COMMA and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen at the end of moore's law ;SEMICOLON this ultimate bug is coming .PERIOD 
but we're coming to appreciate ,COMMA is the transition from 2d to 3d ,COMMA from programming bits to programming atoms ,COMMA turns the ends of moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication ,COMMA where the output of computation programs the physical world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA together ,COMMA these two projects answer questions i hadn't asked carefully .PERIOD the class at mit shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one :COLON personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything i've seen in technology for a very long time .PERIOD 
and the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide :COLON people locally developing solutions to local problems .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i'm a believer .PERIOD 
i'm a believer in global warming ,COMMA and my record is good on the subject .PERIOD 
but my subject is national security .PERIOD 
we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy .PERIOD 
i'm talking about opec oil .PERIOD 
and let me take you back <NUM> years to <NUM> .PERIOD 
you're probably thinking that was my birth year .PERIOD 
it wasn't .PERIOD it was <NUM> .PERIOD 
but go back to <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and look at that point what we ,COMMA our country ,COMMA was faced with .PERIOD 
it's the same energy question that you're looking at today ,COMMA but it's different sources of fuel .PERIOD 
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .PERIOD 
at that point ,COMMA we were looking for a fuel that was cleaner ,COMMA it was cheaper ,COMMA and it wasn't ours though ,COMMA it was theirs .PERIOD 
so at that point ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal .PERIOD 
but as we moved on to the period now ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA we're back really at another decision point .PERIOD 
what is the decision point ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's what we're going to use in the future .PERIOD 
so from here ,COMMA it's pretty clear to me ,COMMA we would prefer to have cleaner ,COMMA cheaper ,COMMA domestic ,COMMA ours -- and we have that ,COMMA we have that -- which is natural gas .PERIOD 
so here you are ,COMMA that the cost of all this to the world is <NUM> million barrels of oil ,COMMA give or take a few barrels ,COMMA every day .PERIOD 
and the cost annually is three trillion dollars .PERIOD 
and one trillion of that goes to opec .PERIOD 
now if you look at the cost of opec ,COMMA it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the milken institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since <NUM> ,COMMA is what we paid for oil from opec .PERIOD 
now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both .PERIOD 
but it's the greatest transfer of wealth ,COMMA from one group to another in the history of mankind .PERIOD 
and it continues .PERIOD 
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth ,COMMA you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us .PERIOD 
and with that ,COMMA we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen .PERIOD 
we are policing the world ,COMMA and how are we doing that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i know the response to this .PERIOD 
i would bet there aren't <NUM> percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world .PERIOD 
raise your hand if you think you know .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> .PERIOD 
one is under construction by the chinese and the other <NUM> belong to us .PERIOD 
why do we have <NUM> aircraft carriers ?QUESTIONMARK 
do we have a corner on the market ?QUESTIONMARK 
are we smarter than anybody else ?QUESTIONMARK i'm not sure .PERIOD 
if you look at where they're located -- and on this slide it's the red blobs on there -- there are five that are operating in the mid-east ,COMMA and the rest of them are in the united states .PERIOD 
they just move back to the mid-east and those come back .PERIOD 
so actually most of the <NUM> we have are tied up in the mid-east .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK why are they in the mid-east ?QUESTIONMARK 
they're there to control ,COMMA keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available .PERIOD 
and the united states uses about <NUM> million barrels a day ,COMMA which is about <NUM> percent of all the oil used everyday in the world .PERIOD 
and we're doing it with four percent of the population .PERIOD 
that's not sustainable .PERIOD 
so where do we go from here ?QUESTIONMARK 
does that continue ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA it's going to continue .PERIOD 
the slide you're looking at here is <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
over that period you are going to double your demand .PERIOD 
and when you look at what we're using the oil for ,COMMA <NUM> percent of it is used for transportation fuel .PERIOD 
so when somebody says ,COMMA let's go more nuclear ,COMMA let's go wind ,COMMA let's go solar ,COMMA fine ;SEMICOLON i'm for anything american ,COMMA anything american .PERIOD 
but if you're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil ,COMMA you have to address transportation .PERIOD 
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user ,COMMA we use <NUM> million barrels and the chinese use <NUM> .PERIOD 
the chinese have a little bit better plan -- or they have a plan ;SEMICOLON we have no plan .PERIOD 
in the history of america ,COMMA we've never had an energy plan .PERIOD 
we don't even realize the resources that we have available to us .PERIOD 
if you take the last <NUM> years and bring forward ,COMMA you've transferred to opec a trillion dollars .PERIOD 
if you go forward the next <NUM> years and cap the price of oil at <NUM> dollars a barrel ,COMMA you will pay <NUM> trillion .PERIOD 
that's not sustainable either .PERIOD 
but the days of cheap oil are over .PERIOD 
they're over .PERIOD 
they make it very clear to you ,COMMA the saudis do ,COMMA they have to have <NUM> dollars a barrel to make their social commitments .PERIOD 
that has nothing to do with it .PERIOD 
it's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil .PERIOD 
there is no free market for oil .PERIOD 
the oil is priced off the margin .PERIOD 
and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil .PERIOD 
so where are we headed from here ?QUESTIONMARK 
natural gas will do everything we want it to do .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> octane fuel .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> percent cleaner than oil .PERIOD 
it's ours ,COMMA we have an abundance of it .PERIOD 
and it does not require a refinery .PERIOD 
it comes out of the ground at <NUM> octane .PERIOD 
it's going to be very simple for us to use .PERIOD 
it's going to be simple to accomplish this .PERIOD 
you're going to find ,COMMA and i'll tell you in just a minute ,COMMA what you're looking for to make it happen .PERIOD 
but here you can look at the list .PERIOD 
it's for power generation ,COMMA transportation ,COMMA it's peaking fuel ,COMMA it's all those .PERIOD 
do we have enough natural gas ?QUESTIONMARK 
look at the bar on the left .PERIOD it's <NUM> trillion .PERIOD 
it's what we use a year .PERIOD 
go forward and the estimates that you have from the eia and onto the industry estimates -- the industry knows what they're talking about -- we've got <NUM> trillion cubic feet of natural gas that's available to us .PERIOD 
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ?QUESTIONMARK 
it would be three times what the saudis claim they have .PERIOD 
and they claim they have <NUM> billion barrels of oil ,COMMA which i do not believe .PERIOD 
i think it's probably <NUM> billion barrels .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA whether they say they're right or whatever ,COMMA we have plenty of natural gas .PERIOD 
you take eight million trucks -- these are 18-wheelers -- and take them to natural gas ,COMMA reduce carbon by <NUM> percent ,COMMA it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels .PERIOD 
so you will cut <NUM> percent off of opec with eight million trucks .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> million vehicles in america .PERIOD 
so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel ,COMMA is the way i see it .PERIOD 
i don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .PERIOD 
that's your concern .PERIOD 
but when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas ,COMMA because you have plenty of natural gas .PERIOD 
but as i said ,COMMA i'm for anything american .PERIOD 
now let me take you -- i've been a realist -- i went from theorist early to realist .PERIOD 
if you look at the world ,COMMA you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent .PERIOD 
and here you can see methane ,COMMA if that's the way you're going to go ,COMMA that there's plenty of methane -- natural gas is methane ,COMMA methane and natural gas are interchangeable -- but if you decide that you're going to use some methane -- and i'm gone ,COMMA so it's up to you -- but we do have plenty of methane hydrates .PERIOD 
so i think i've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in america .PERIOD 
if we do -- it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA we have no energy plan .PERIOD 
if we could do that ,COMMA i think we would take our first step to an energy plan .PERIOD 
if we did ,COMMA we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON thanks for that .PERIOD 
so from your point of view ,COMMA you had this great pickens plan that was based on wind energy ,COMMA and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed .PERIOD 
what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON i lost <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA what happened to us ,COMMA chris ,COMMA is that power ,COMMA it's priced off the margin .PERIOD 
and so the margin is natural gas .PERIOD 
and at the time i went into the wind business ,COMMA natural gas was nine dollars .PERIOD 
today it's two dollars and forty cents .PERIOD 
you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf .PERIOD 
so what happened was that ,COMMA through increased ability to use fracking technology ,COMMA the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted ,COMMA which made wind uncompetitive .PERIOD 
in a nutshell that's what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON that's what happened .PERIOD 
we found out that we could go to the source rock ,COMMA which were the carboniferous shales in the basins .PERIOD 
the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york ,COMMA pennsylvania ,COMMA west virginia ;SEMICOLON and haynesville in louisiana .PERIOD 
this stuff is everywhere .PERIOD 
we are overwhelmed with natural gas .PERIOD 
and now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON well you say a big investor .PERIOD 
it's my life .PERIOD 
now i do own stocks .PERIOD 
somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states .PERIOD 
don't i wish .PERIOD 
but no ,COMMA i'm not .PERIOD i own stocks .PERIOD 
but i also am in the fueling business .PERIOD 
but natural gas is a fossil fuel .PERIOD 
you burn it ,COMMA you release co2 .PERIOD 
so you believe in the threat of climate change .PERIOD 
why doesn't that prospect concern you ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON well you're going to have to use something .PERIOD 
what do you have to replace it ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA no .PERIOD the argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense ,COMMA because the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal ,COMMA correct ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .PERIOD 
but if that's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don't get invested in ,COMMA then ,COMMA long-term ,COMMA we're screwed anyway ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON well i'm not ready to give up ,COMMA but jim and i talked there as he left ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA how do you feel about natural gas ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA well it's a bridge fuel ,COMMA is what it is .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA bridge to what ?QUESTIONMARK 
where are we headed ?QUESTIONMARK 
see but again ,COMMA i told you ,COMMA i don't have to worry with that .PERIOD 
you all do .PERIOD 
but i don't think that's right ,COMMA boone .PERIOD 
i think you're a person who believes in your legacy .PERIOD 
you're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate .PERIOD 
do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON i don't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program .PERIOD 
i can tell you it will be a failure .PERIOD 
they just aren't ,COMMA it's a bad deal .PERIOD 
look at solyndra ,COMMA or whatever it was .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA that was told to be a bad idea <NUM> times ,COMMA they went ahead and did it anyway .PERIOD 
but that only blew out <NUM> million .PERIOD 
i think it's closer to a billion .PERIOD 
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA don't build a reformer on a fault .PERIOD 
and number two ,COMMA do not build a reformer on the ocean .PERIOD 
and now i think reformers are safe .PERIOD 
move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers .PERIOD 
you're going to have to have energy .PERIOD there is no question .PERIOD 
you can't -- okay .PERIOD 
one of the questions from the audience is ,COMMA with fracking and the natural gas process ,COMMA what about the problem of methane leaking from that ,COMMA methane being a worse global warming gas than co2 ?QUESTIONMARK 
is that a concern ?QUESTIONMARK 
fracking .PERIOD 
tbp :COLON i'm teasing .PERIOD 
we've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
tbp :COLON no ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA i've told you what my age was .PERIOD 
i got out of school in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in <NUM> .PERIOD 
fracking came out in '<NUM> ,COMMA and don't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the department of energy <NUM> years ago developed fracking .PERIOD 
i don't know what in the hell he's talking about .PERIOD 
i saw my first one in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
i've fracked over <NUM> wells in my life .PERIOD 
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .PERIOD 
now the largest aquifer in north america is from midland ,COMMA texas to the south dakota border ,COMMA across eight states -- big aquifer :COLON ogallala ,COMMA triassic age .PERIOD 
there had to have been <NUM> wells fracked in oklahoma ,COMMA texas ,COMMA kansas in that aquifer .PERIOD 
i don't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .PERIOD 
your picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately ,COMMA that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON solar and wind ,COMMA jim and i agreed on that in <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA it's going to be a small part ,COMMA because you can't rely on it .PERIOD 
so how does the world get off fossil fuels ?QUESTIONMARK 
tbp :COLON how do we get there ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have so much natural gas ,COMMA a day will not come where you say ,COMMA well let's don't use that anymore .PERIOD 
you'll keep using it .PERIOD it is the cleanest of all .PERIOD 
and if you look at california ,COMMA they use <NUM> buses .PERIOD 
lamta have been on natural gas for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
the ft .PERIOD worth t has been on it for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel .PERIOD 
why are all the trash trucks today in southern california on natural gas ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's because of air quality .PERIOD 
i know what you're telling me ,COMMA and i'm not disagreeing with you .PERIOD 
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i say ,COMMA that is your problem .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA so it's the bridge fuel .PERIOD 
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out .PERIOD 
tbp :COLON i lost <NUM> million on the wind ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA sure ,COMMA i'm game for it .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA again ,COMMA i'm trying to get energy solved for america .PERIOD 
and anything american will work for me .PERIOD 
boone ,COMMA i really ,COMMA really appreciate you coming here ,COMMA engaging in this conversation .PERIOD 
i think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you .PERIOD 
and that was a real gift you gave this audience .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
you're going to see some other speakers today ,COMMA i already know ,COMMA who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff ,COMMA and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA with technology it never is .PERIOD 
so it's very easy ,COMMA comparatively speaking ,COMMA to be resilient .PERIOD 
i think that ,COMMA if we look at what happened on the internet ,COMMA with such an incredible last half a dozen years ,COMMA that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it .PERIOD 
a lot of how we decide ,COMMA how we're supposed to react to things and what we're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them .PERIOD 
and so i think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the internet is a gold rush .PERIOD 
it's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick .PERIOD 
for one thing ,COMMA both were very real .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA in that gold rush ,COMMA they took over $700 million worth of gold out of california .PERIOD it was very real .PERIOD 
huge boom .PERIOD huge boom .PERIOD huge bust .PERIOD huge bust .PERIOD 
you keep going ,COMMA and both things are lots of hype .PERIOD 
i don't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet -- like getrichcom .PERIOD 
but you had the same thing with the gold rush .PERIOD gold .PERIOD gold .PERIOD gold .PERIOD 
sixty-eight rich men on the steamer portland .PERIOD stacks of yellow metal .PERIOD 
some have <NUM> .PERIOD many have more .PERIOD 
a few bring out <NUM> dollars each .PERIOD 
people would get very excited about this when they read these articles .PERIOD 
the eldorado of the united states of america :COLON the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in california .PERIOD 
and the parallels between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly .PERIOD 
so many people left what they were doing .PERIOD 
and what would happen is -- and the gold rush went on for years .PERIOD 
but they keep hearing about people getting rich ,COMMA and then in <NUM> they still hear that .PERIOD and they think it's not real .PERIOD 
by about <NUM> ,COMMA they're thinking ,COMMA am i the stupidest person on earth by not rushing to california ?QUESTIONMARK and they start to decide they are .PERIOD 
these are community affairs ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people would caravan across the united states ,COMMA and they would form companies .PERIOD 
these were typically not solitary efforts .PERIOD but no matter what ,COMMA if you were a lawyer or a banker ,COMMA people dropped what they were doing ,COMMA no matter what skill set they had ,COMMA to go pan for gold .PERIOD 
this guy on the left ,COMMA dr .PERIOD richard beverley cole ,COMMA he lived in philadelphia and he took the panama route .PERIOD 
they would take a ship down to panama ,COMMA across the isthmus ,COMMA and then take another ship north .PERIOD 
this guy ,COMMA dr .PERIOD toland ,COMMA went by covered wagon to california .PERIOD 
this has its parallels ,COMMA too .PERIOD doctors leaving their practices .PERIOD 
these are both very successful -- a physician in one case ,COMMA a surgeon in the other .PERIOD 
same thing happened on the internet .PERIOD you get drkoopcom .PERIOD 
in the gold rush ,COMMA people literally jumped ship .PERIOD 
the san francisco harbor was clogged with <NUM> ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold .PERIOD 
so there were literally <NUM> captains and <NUM> ships .PERIOD 
they turned the ships into hotels ,COMMA because they couldn't sail them anywhere .PERIOD 
and you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened .PERIOD 
the fort in san francisco at the time had about <NUM> soldiers .PERIOD 
half of them deserted to go look for gold .PERIOD 
and one of the soldiers wrote home ,COMMA and this is the sentence that he put :COLON the struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and <NUM> dollars a day is a rather severe one .PERIOD 
this is actually from the klondike gold rush .PERIOD this is the white pass trail .PERIOD 
they loaded up their mules and their horses .PERIOD 
and they didn't plan right .PERIOD 
and they didn't know how far they would really have to go ,COMMA and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff .PERIOD 
in fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going .PERIOD 
it got renamed the dead horse trail .PERIOD 
and the canadian minister of the interior wrote this at the time :COLON thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way ,COMMA sometimes in bunches under the cliffs ,COMMA with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above ,COMMA sometimes in tangled masses ,COMMA filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march ,COMMA often ,COMMA i regret to say ,COMMA exhausted ,COMMA but still alive ,COMMA a fact we were unaware of ,COMMA until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade .PERIOD 
the eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road .PERIOD 
the inhumanity which this trail has been witness to ,COMMA the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone ,COMMA cannot be imagined .PERIOD they certainly cannot be described .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA without the smell that would have accompanied that ,COMMA we had the same thing on the internet :COLON very bad burn rate calculations .PERIOD 
i'll just play one of these and you'll remember it .PERIOD 
bride #2 :COLON then why does she have my invitation ?QUESTIONMARK 
announcer :COLON what may be a little thing to some . .PERIOD bride #3 :COLON you are mine ,COMMA little man .PERIOD 
announcer :COLON could be a really big deal to you .PERIOD husband #1 :COLON is that your wife ?QUESTIONMARK 
jeff bezos :COLON it's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for .PERIOD 
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the <NUM> super bowl to air that ad ,COMMA even though ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA here's where our analogy with the gold rush starts to diverge ,COMMA and i think rather severely .PERIOD 
and that is ,COMMA in a gold rush ,COMMA when it's over ,COMMA it's over .PERIOD 
here's this guy :COLON there are many men in dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed .PERIOD 
they've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip ,COMMA risked life ,COMMA health and property ,COMMA spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them .PERIOD 
and that was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the very common story .PERIOD 
because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA if you look at the <NUM> gold rush -- the entire american river region ,COMMA within two years -- every stone had been turned .PERIOD and after that ,COMMA only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there .PERIOD 
and there are a lot of similarities between the internet and the electric industry .PERIOD 
with the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they're both sort of thin ,COMMA horizontal ,COMMA enabling layers that go across lots of different industries .PERIOD 
it's not a specific thing .PERIOD 
but electricity is also very ,COMMA very broad ,COMMA so you have to sort of narrow it down .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power .PERIOD 
it's an incredible means of coordinating ,COMMA in a very fine-grained way ,COMMA information flows .PERIOD 
there's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity .PERIOD 
and the part of the electric revolution that i want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances .PERIOD 
the killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb .PERIOD 
so the light bulb is what wired the world .PERIOD 
and they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world .PERIOD 
they were really thinking about -- they weren't putting electricity into the home ;SEMICOLON they were putting lighting into the home .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA but it really -- it got the electricity .PERIOD it took a long time .PERIOD 
all the streets had to be torn up .PERIOD 
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations .PERIOD 
and they're tearing up all the streets .PERIOD 
the edison electric company ,COMMA which became edison general electric ,COMMA which became general electric ,COMMA paid for all of this digging up of the streets .PERIOD it was incredibly expensive .PERIOD 
but that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the web .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA remember ,COMMA the web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network .PERIOD 
so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- i'm going back now to ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA the explosive part of the web in <NUM> ,COMMA when it was growing <NUM> percent a year .PERIOD 
how could it grow at <NUM> percent a year in <NUM> when people weren't really investing in the web ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure ,COMMA and then home appliances started coming into being .PERIOD 
and this was huge .PERIOD the first one was the electric fan -- this was the <NUM> electric fan .PERIOD 
and the appliances ,COMMA the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it's anywhere from <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD it goes on a long time .PERIOD 
it starts about <NUM> .PERIOD and the electric fan was a big success .PERIOD 
the electric iron ,COMMA also very big .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit .PERIOD 
there's asbestos under that handle there .PERIOD 
this is the first vacuum cleaner ,COMMA the <NUM> skinner vacuum ,COMMA from the hoover company .PERIOD and this one weighed <NUM> pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car .PERIOD 
so it wasn't a big seller .PERIOD 
this was truly ,COMMA truly an early-adopter product -- the <NUM> skinner vacuum .PERIOD 
but three years later ,COMMA by <NUM> ,COMMA it weighed <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA not all these things were highly successful .PERIOD 
this is the electric tie press ,COMMA which never really did catch on .PERIOD 
people ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA decided that they would not wrinkle their ties .PERIOD 
these never really caught on either :COLON the electric shoe warmer and drier .PERIOD never a big seller .PERIOD 
this came in ,COMMA like ,COMMA six different colors .PERIOD 
i don't know why .PERIOD but i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention ;SEMICOLON maybe it's time to give this one another shot .PERIOD 
so i thought we could build a super bowl ad for this .PERIOD 
we'd need the right partner .PERIOD and i thought that really -- i thought that would really work ,COMMA to give that another shot .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires ,COMMA and it took a lot of time and attention .PERIOD 
i want to point out one thing .PERIOD this is -- you guys know what this is .PERIOD 
they hadn't invented the electric socket yet .PERIOD 
so this was -- remember ,COMMA they didn't wire the houses for electricity .PERIOD 
they wired them for lighting .PERIOD so your -- your appliances would plug in .PERIOD 
and you'd plug it in there .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if you've seen the carousel of progress at disney world ,COMMA you've seen this .PERIOD here are the cables coming up into this light fixture .PERIOD 
all the appliances plug in there .PERIOD and you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance .PERIOD 
the next thing that really was a big ,COMMA big deal was the washing machine .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this was an object of much envy and lust .PERIOD 
everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines .PERIOD 
on the left-hand side ,COMMA this was the soapy water .PERIOD 
and it would clean your clothes .PERIOD 
this is the clean rinse-water .PERIOD so you'd take the clothes out of here ,COMMA put them in here ,COMMA and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer .PERIOD 
and this was a big deal .PERIOD 
you'd keep this on your porch .PERIOD it was a little bit messy and kind of a pain .PERIOD 
and you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket .PERIOD 
and that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation ,COMMA because they hadn't invented the off switch .PERIOD 
that was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn't make any sense .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket .PERIOD 
so you know ,COMMA when you were done with it ,COMMA you unscrewed it .PERIOD 
that's what you did .PERIOD you didn't turn it off .PERIOD 
and as i said before ,COMMA they hadn't invented the electric outlet either ,COMMA so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device .PERIOD 
and there are -- when you research this ,COMMA there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices .PERIOD 
and they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house .PERIOD 
and there was no off switch ,COMMA so it wasn't very good .PERIOD 
and you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA before i get too far into condemning our ancestors ,COMMA i thought i'd show you :COLON this is my conference room .PERIOD 
this is a total kludge ,COMMA if you ask me .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA this got installed upside down .PERIOD this light socket -- and so the cord keeps falling out ,COMMA so i taped it in .PERIOD 
this is supposed -- don't even get me started .PERIOD but that's not the worst one .PERIOD 
this is what it looks like under my desk .PERIOD 
i took this picture just two days ago .PERIOD 
so we really haven't progressed that much since <NUM> .PERIOD 
it's a total ,COMMA total mess .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we think it's getting better ,COMMA but have you tried to install <NUM> yourself ?QUESTIONMARK 
i challenge you to try .PERIOD it's very hard .PERIOD 
i know phds in computer science -- this process has brought them to tears ,COMMA absolute tears .PERIOD 
and that's assuming you already have dsl in your house .PERIOD 
try to get dsl installed in your house .PERIOD 
the engineers who do it everyday can't do it .PERIOD 
they have to -- typically ,COMMA they come three times .PERIOD 
and one friend of mine was telling me a story :COLON not only did they get there and have to wait ,COMMA but then the engineers ,COMMA when they finally did get there ,COMMA for the third time ,COMMA they had to call somebody .PERIOD 
so we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA dsl is a kludge .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it's being put to -- you know it's the whole thing -- we're very ,COMMA very primitive .PERIOD and that's kind of the point .PERIOD 
but the good thing is ,COMMA with innovation ,COMMA there isn't a last nugget .PERIOD 
every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities .PERIOD 
and if you believe that ,COMMA then you believe that where we are -- this is what i think -- i believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and i haven't even talked about user interfaces on the web -- but there's so much kludge ,COMMA so much terrible stuff -- we are at the <NUM> hurley washing machine stage with the internet .PERIOD 
that's where we are .PERIOD we don't get our hair caught in it ,COMMA but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are .PERIOD 
we're in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and if you believe that ,COMMA then stuff like this doesn't bother you .PERIOD this is <NUM> :COLON all the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble .PERIOD 
<NUM> :COLON amazontoast .PERIOD in <NUM> :COLON amazonbomb .PERIOD 
my mom hates this picture .PERIOD 
and i do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us .PERIOD 
and in <NUM> ,COMMA sears -- i want to get this exactly right .PERIOD 
this was the advertisement that they ran in <NUM> .PERIOD 
it says :COLON use your electricity for more than light .PERIOD 
and i think that's where we are .PERIOD 
we're very ,COMMA very early .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective .PERIOD 
i'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language ,COMMA and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .PERIOD 
i want to warn you about that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i do want to say ,COMMA at the outset ,COMMA that i think compassion's great .PERIOD 
and i think it's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths .PERIOD 
at the same time ,COMMA i think religions don't deserve all the credit .PERIOD 
i think nature gave them a helping hand here .PERIOD 
i'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are ,COMMA in a certain sense ,COMMA built into human nature .PERIOD 
but i'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature ,COMMA you realize that just affirming compassion ,COMMA and affirming the golden rule ,COMMA is really not enough .PERIOD 
there's a lot of work to be done after that .PERIOD 
ok so ,COMMA a quick natural history ,COMMA first of compassion .PERIOD 
i think it's probably the case that ,COMMA in the human evolutionary lineage ,COMMA even before there were homo sapiens ,COMMA feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool ,COMMA and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened .PERIOD 
it happened through a principle known as kin selection .PERIOD 
and the basic idea of kin selection is that ,COMMA if an animal feels compassion for a close relative ,COMMA and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative ,COMMA then ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA from a biologist's point of view ,COMMA compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
i'll get there -- i hope to get a little fuzzier .PERIOD 
this doesn't bother me so much ,COMMA that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self-serving at the genetic level .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family .PERIOD 
that's the bad news .PERIOD the good news is compassion is natural .PERIOD 
the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family .PERIOD 
biologists call that reciprocal altruism .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA i know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past ,COMMA but from a biologist's point of view ,COMMA this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too .PERIOD 
it's not that people think that ,COMMA when they feel the compassion .PERIOD 
it's not consciously self-serving ,COMMA but to a biologist ,COMMA that's the logic .PERIOD 
i'm sure a lot of you ,COMMA if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them ,COMMA you feel really bad .PERIOD 
but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of ,COMMA you can probably live with that .PERIOD 
that's just human nature .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's another good news/bad news story .PERIOD 
it's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic .PERIOD 
the bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's still work to be done .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism ,COMMA which i think is kind of good news ,COMMA which is that the way that this is played out in the human species ,COMMA it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule .PERIOD 
i don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes ,COMMA but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions ,COMMA no exposure to ethical philosophy ,COMMA and you'll find ,COMMA if you spend time with these people ,COMMA that ,COMMA basically ,COMMA they believe that one good turn deserves another ,COMMA and that bad deeds should be punished .PERIOD 
and evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they do understand that if you want to be treated well ,COMMA you treat other people well .PERIOD 
and it's good to treat other people well .PERIOD 
that's close to being a kind of built-in intuition .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's good news .PERIOD now ,COMMA if you've been paying attention ,COMMA you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here ;SEMICOLON we still aren't to universal love ,COMMA and it's true because ,COMMA although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural ,COMMA it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA for example ,COMMA none of us ,COMMA probably ,COMMA want to go to prison ,COMMA but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we have a rationale for that .PERIOD 
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .PERIOD 
none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion .PERIOD 
we have the capacity to carve out exceptions ,COMMA put people in a special category .PERIOD 
and the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison ,COMMA you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule -- that in everyday life ,COMMA the way we all make these decisions about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to ,COMMA is we use a much rougher and readier formula .PERIOD 
basically it's just like ,COMMA if you're my enemy ,COMMA if you're my rival -- if you're not my friend ,COMMA if you're not in my family -- i'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you .PERIOD 
we all do that ,COMMA and you see it all over the world .PERIOD 
you see it in the middle east :COLON people who ,COMMA from gaza ,COMMA are firing missiles at israel .PERIOD 
they wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them ,COMMA but they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA but the israelis ,COMMA or some of them have done things that put them in a special category .PERIOD 
the israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them ,COMMA but they impose one on gaza ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the palestinians ,COMMA or some of them ,COMMA have brought this on themselves .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble .PERIOD 
and it's natural to do that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not ,COMMA by itself ,COMMA going to bring us universal love .PERIOD 
it's not going to save the world .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's one piece of good news i have that may save the world .PERIOD okay .PERIOD 
are you on the edges of your seats here ?QUESTIONMARK 
good ,COMMA because before i tell you about that good news ,COMMA i'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain .PERIOD 
it's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about .PERIOD 
it's just a quick introduction to game theory .PERIOD 
this won't hurt .PERIOD okay .PERIOD 
it's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games .PERIOD 
if you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies ,COMMA the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation .PERIOD 
and if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies ,COMMA it's a zero-sum situation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what do those terms mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA their fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in tennis ,COMMA every point is either good for you and bad for the other person ,COMMA or good for them ,COMMA bad for you .PERIOD 
that's a non-zero-sum game .PERIOD 
and in real life ,COMMA there are lots of non-zero-sum games .PERIOD 
in the realm of economics ,COMMA say ,COMMA if you buy something :COLON that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money ,COMMA but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise .PERIOD 
you both feel you've won .PERIOD 
in a war ,COMMA two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game .PERIOD 
it's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life .PERIOD 
and you could basically reformulate what i said earlier ,COMMA about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed ,COMMA by just saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation with some of their friends or allies .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA kind of webs of non-zero-sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD so ,COMMA now you're ready for the good news that i said might save the world .PERIOD 
and now i can admit that it might not too ,COMMA now that i've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff .PERIOD 
you can go back all the way to the stone age :COLON technological evolution -- roads ,COMMA the wheel ,COMMA writing ,COMMA a lot of transportation and communication technologies -- has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non-zero-sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances .PERIOD 
it's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village to the ancient state ,COMMA the empire ,COMMA and now here we are in a globalized world .PERIOD 
and the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness .PERIOD 
you've probably heard the term interdependence applied to the modern world .PERIOD well ,COMMA that's just another term for non-zero-sum .PERIOD 
if your fortunes are interdependent with somebody ,COMMA then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them .PERIOD 
and you see this all the time in the modern world .PERIOD 
you saw it with the recent economic crash ,COMMA where bad things happen in the economy -- bad for everybody ,COMMA for much of the world .PERIOD 
good things happen ,COMMA and it's good for much of the world .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm happy to say ,COMMA i think there's really evidence that this non-zero-sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA if you look at the american attitudes toward japanese during world war ii -- look at the depictions of japanese in the american media as just about subhuman ,COMMA and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs ,COMMA really without giving it much of a thought -- and you compare that to the attitude now ,COMMA i think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence .PERIOD 
any form of interdependence ,COMMA or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i think that's good .PERIOD 
and the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics .PERIOD 
environmental problems ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA put us all in the same boat .PERIOD 
and there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA probably a lot of american christians don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship with muslims halfway around the world ,COMMA but they really are ,COMMA because if these muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it ,COMMA that's good for americans ,COMMA because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten american security .PERIOD 
if they get less and less happy ,COMMA that will be bad for americans .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's plenty of non-zero-sumness .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA the question is :COLON if there's so much non-zero-sumness ,COMMA why has the world not yet been suffused in love ,COMMA peace ,COMMA and understanding ?QUESTIONMARK 
the answer's complicated .PERIOD it's the occasion for a whole other talk .PERIOD 
certainly ,COMMA a couple of things are that ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world .PERIOD 
in both of these areas ,COMMA i think politicians can play a role .PERIOD 
this isn't only about religion .PERIOD 
and politicians can be aware ,COMMA and should be aware that ,COMMA when people around the world are looking at them ,COMMA are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation -- like ,COMMA say ,COMMA america ,COMMA or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cues like :COLON do we feel we're being respected ?QUESTIONMARK 
because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA historically ,COMMA if you're not being respected ,COMMA you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum ,COMMA mutually profitable relationship with people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out .PERIOD 
and some of this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is in the realm of political work .PERIOD 
this is not the same as compassion ,COMMA but it's conducive to compassion .PERIOD it opens the channels for compassion .PERIOD 
and i'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story ,COMMA which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .PERIOD 
that's good ,COMMA but again we tend to deploy it selectively .PERIOD 
once we define somebody as an enemy ,COMMA we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes ,COMMA just naturally .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you want to take a particularly hard case for an american :COLON somebody in iran who is burning an american flag ,COMMA and you see them on tv .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the average american is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person .PERIOD 
and if you tell them ,COMMA well ,COMMA they think america disrespects them and even wants to dominate them ,COMMA and they hate america .PERIOD 
has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA they'll resist that comparison and that's natural ,COMMA that's human .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA similarly ,COMMA the person in iran :COLON when you try to humanize somebody in america who said that islam is evil ,COMMA they'll have trouble with that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn't naturally go .PERIOD 
i think it's worth the trouble because ,COMMA again ,COMMA it just helps us to understand .PERIOD 
if you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags ,COMMA it helps to understand what makes them do it .PERIOD 
and i think it's good moral exercise .PERIOD 
i would say here is where religious leaders come in ,COMMA because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people ,COMMA at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business .PERIOD 
it's their great calling right now ,COMMA to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations ,COMMA appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat .PERIOD 
i would just sum up the way things look ,COMMA at least from this secular perspective ,COMMA as far as compassion and the golden rule go ,COMMA by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature .PERIOD 
it's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed .PERIOD 
and it's going to take real work to change that .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA nobody ever said that doing god's work was going to be easy .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
welcome to <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you .PERIOD 
today's event you might call how mountains teach .PERIOD 
a little background :COLON for <NUM> years i've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases ,COMMA non-existent .PERIOD 
it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA next <NUM> years and the last <NUM> years -- basically civilization's story so far .PERIOD 
so we have the long now foundation in san francisco .PERIOD 
it's an incubator for about a dozen projects ,COMMA all having to do with continuity over the long term .PERIOD 
our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- i suppose ,COMMA a mythic undertaking :COLON to build a 10000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period .PERIOD 
and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious .PERIOD 
go to the clock .PERIOD and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago .PERIOD 
it's the first working prototype of the clock .PERIOD 
it's about nine feet high .PERIOD 
designed by danny hillis and alexander rose .PERIOD it's presently in london ,COMMA and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this was the first solution .PERIOD 
alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this is what deep time does to a building .PERIOD 
here's a beautiful project .PERIOD they really knew it'd last forever ,COMMA because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones .PERIOD 
that's what happens to buildings .PERIOD they're vulnerable .PERIOD 
even the most durable and intactable buildings ,COMMA like the pyramids of giza ,COMMA are in bad shape when you look up close .PERIOD 
they've been looted inside and out .PERIOD 
and they're built to protect things but they don't protect things .PERIOD 
so we got to thinking ,COMMA if you can't put things safely in a building ,COMMA where can you safely put them ?QUESTIONMARK we thought ,COMMA ok ,COMMA underground .PERIOD 
how about underground with a view ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the obvious answer was ,COMMA we need a mountain .PERIOD 
you don't want just any mountain .PERIOD 
you need absolutely the right mountain if you're going to have a clock for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so here's an image of the long view of the search problem .PERIOD 
and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain ,COMMA so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest .PERIOD 
we looked at mesas in new mexico .PERIOD 
we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona .PERIOD 
then roger kennedy ,COMMA who was the director of the national parks service ,COMMA led us to eastern nevada ,COMMA to america's newest and oldest national park ,COMMA which is called great basin national park .PERIOD 
it's the highest range in the state -- over <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
and you'll notice that on the left ,COMMA on the left ,COMMA on the west ,COMMA it's very steep ,COMMA and on the right it's gentle .PERIOD 
this place is remote .PERIOD it's over <NUM> miles from any major city .PERIOD 
it's nowhere near any interstate or railroad .PERIOD 
and it's -- the only thing that goes by is what's called america's loneliest highway ,COMMA us .PERIOD <NUM> .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA inside the yellow line here ,COMMA on the right is -- that's all national park .PERIOD 
inside the green line is national forest .PERIOD 
and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as it happened ,COMMA that two-mile-long strip right in the middle ,COMMA this vertical ,COMMA was available because it was private land .PERIOD 
and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here ,COMMA who started the process ,COMMA long now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land .PERIOD 
and now let's look at the grand truth of what's there .PERIOD 
we're in pole canyon ,COMMA looking west up the western escarpment of mount washington ,COMMA which is <NUM> feet on top .PERIOD 
those white cliffs are a dense cambrian limestone .PERIOD 
that's a 2000-foot thick formation ,COMMA and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .PERIOD 
it would be a pilgrimage to get to it ;SEMICOLON it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is .PERIOD 
so last june ,COMMA the long now board ,COMMA some staff and some donors and advisors ,COMMA made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate ,COMMA one ,COMMA if it's the right mountain ,COMMA and two ,COMMA if it's the right mountain ,COMMA how it might actually work for us .PERIOD 
now danny hillis sort of framed the problem .PERIOD 
he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work .PERIOD 
it's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure .PERIOD 
in this case it might well be an image of the clock .PERIOD 
then there's the point of embarkation ,COMMA that is ,COMMA the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .PERIOD 
then -- this is a nice image of it ,COMMA there's the labyrinth .PERIOD 
then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there .PERIOD 
now brian eno ,COMMA who's been in the thick of the long now process ,COMMA spent two years making a cd .PERIOD called january <NUM> ,COMMA and it's bell studies for the clock of the long now .PERIOD 
based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that danny hillis developed ,COMMA so that a peal of <NUM> bells makes a different peal every day for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA pretty soon we'll hear the sound .PERIOD 
january <NUM> .PERIOD there it is .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA back to danny's list .PERIOD 
number five of the seven is the payoff .PERIOD this is it .PERIOD the climax .PERIOD 
the goal .PERIOD the main thing that you're trying to get to .PERIOD 
and then danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff .PERIOD 
then there's the return .PERIOD 
you've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world ,COMMA so you have time to assimilate what you've learned .PERIOD 
at the end of it there's something physical ,COMMA a kind of reward that you take away .PERIOD 
it might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain .PERIOD 
something that's just yours .PERIOD 
how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we're talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is not a normal building project .PERIOD 
what do you look for ?QUESTIONMARK 
start with borders .PERIOD if you look on the left side of the cliffs here ,COMMA that's national park .PERIOD that's sacrosanct -- you can't do anything with that .PERIOD to the right of it is national forest .PERIOD 
there's possibilities .PERIOD the borders are important .PERIOD 
other elements were mines ,COMMA weather ,COMMA approaches and elevation .PERIOD 
and especially trees .PERIOD look at those things up on top there .PERIOD 
it turns out that mount washington is covered with bristlecone pines .PERIOD 
they're the world's oldest living thing .PERIOD 
there are trees on that mountain that are <NUM> years old and still living .PERIOD 
the wood is so solid it's like stone ,COMMA and it lasts for a long time .PERIOD 
so when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain ,COMMA some of them go back <NUM> years .PERIOD 
the stone itself is absolutely beautiful ,COMMA sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there .PERIOD 
we had tree ring analysts from the university of arizona join us on the expedition .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you guys have a pine cone handy ,COMMA now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it ,COMMA especially on the end .PERIOD 
you'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine .PERIOD a little sensory experience .PERIOD 
here's danny hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on long now land .PERIOD i should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered ,COMMA led by a theory .PERIOD 
edmund schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at timberline ,COMMA and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called ,COMMA longevity under adversity in conifers .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA based on that principle ,COMMA he started looking around at the various trees at timberline ,COMMA and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the white mountains that were over <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA onto the mines .PERIOD the first asking price for the property when we looked at it in <NUM> was one billion dollars for <NUM> acres and a couple of mines .PERIOD 
because the owner said ,COMMA there's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain .PERIOD 
and we said ,COMMA wow ,COMMA that's great .PERIOD listen ,COMMA we'll counter .PERIOD how about zero ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we're a non-profit foundation ,COMMA you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction .PERIOD 
all you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth ,COMMA and by and by ,COMMA thanks to mitch and jay ,COMMA we were able to buy the whole property for <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
this is one of the mines .PERIOD it doesn't have any beryllium in it .PERIOD 
it's called the pole adit .PERIOD and it does have tungsten ,COMMA a little bit of tungsten ,COMMA left over ,COMMA that's the kind of mine it was .PERIOD 
and shale is not quite completely competent rock .PERIOD 
the shale would like some shoring ,COMMA and so parts of it are caved in in there .PERIOD 
that's ben roberts from -- he's the bat specialist from the national park .PERIOD 
but there are many wonders back in there ,COMMA like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA here's another mine that's up on top of the property ,COMMA and it dates back to <NUM> .PERIOD 
that's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims .PERIOD it was a very productive silver mine .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it was the highest-operating mine in nevada ,COMMA and it ran year round .PERIOD 
you can imagine what it was like in the winter at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
there's jeff bezos on the right and paul saville on the left looking for galena ,COMMA which is the lead-silver thing .PERIOD they didn't find any .PERIOD 
they both kept their day jobs .PERIOD here's the last mine .PERIOD 
it's called the bonanza adit .PERIOD it's down in a canyon .PERIOD 
and they also found four species of bats in there .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA almost all those mines ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA meet underneath the mountain .PERIOD 
they don't quite ,COMMA but it's something to think about .PERIOD 
they don't quite meet .PERIOD 
let's go to weather .PERIOD mountains specialize in interesting weather .PERIOD 
way more interesting than monterey even today .PERIOD 
and so one tuesday morning last june ,COMMA there we were .PERIOD 
woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow .PERIOD 
that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again ,COMMA thanks to mitch kapor ,COMMA we're building up there .PERIOD 
and it's a pretty interesting scene .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA on the left there ,COMMA the joyful lady is pat irwin ,COMMA who's the regional head of the national forest service ,COMMA and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there .PERIOD 
we want a temporary use permit for the clock ,COMMA eventually -- 10000-year temporary use permit .PERIOD 
the weather station's pretty interesting .PERIOD 
it runs on solar ,COMMA and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in bozeman ,COMMA montana ,COMMA where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to san francisco ,COMMA where we put the data in real time up on our website .PERIOD 
and there you see a week of weather at <NUM> feet on mount washington .PERIOD 
let's go to approaches .PERIOD 
as it happens ,COMMA there are no trails anywhere on mount washington ,COMMA just a few old mining roads like this ,COMMA so you have to bushwhack everywhere .PERIOD 
you can hike for days and not encounter anybody .PERIOD 
it's this beautiful world all of its own ,COMMA surrounded by cliffs ,COMMA and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom ,COMMA until you get to this barrier ,COMMA and it actually presents a problem .PERIOD 
so you can scratch lincoln canyon as an approach .PERIOD 
another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain .PERIOD 
you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain .PERIOD 
and from where you're standing at <NUM> feet in the valley ,COMMA it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
and you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at <NUM> feet ,COMMA where there's a bit of a problem .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA jeff bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition ,COMMA make the clock inaccessible .PERIOD 
the harder it is to get to ,COMMA the more people will value it .PERIOD 
and check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there .PERIOD 
so alexander rose wanted to explore this route ,COMMA and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at <NUM> feet and headed up the mountain .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as you gain elevation your iq goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up ,COMMA which is great for having a mythic experience ,COMMA whether you want to or not .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA quote ,COMMA there's a hidden notch .PERIOD i think i can get up a ways .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA he's a rock climber ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA he's our executive director .PERIOD 
i don't want him killed .PERIOD i know he's going to love cliffs .PERIOD 
i'm saying ,COMMA be careful ,COMMA be careful ,COMMA be careful .PERIOD 
then he starts going up ,COMMA and the next thing i hear is ,COMMA i'm half-way up .PERIOD it's like climbing stairs .PERIOD i'm going up <NUM> degrees .PERIOD 
and i'm going ,COMMA careful ,COMMA careful .PERIOD please be careful .PERIOD 
and he dashed across the top of the mountains .PERIOD 
first ascent of the western face to mount washington ,COMMA and a solo ascent at that .PERIOD 
we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered .PERIOD 
how about zander's crevice ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD 
so we finally decided on alexander's siq .PERIOD 
zander's siq is named after -- some of you have been to petra ,COMMA there's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into petra called the siq ,COMMA and so this is the siq .PERIOD 
and it really is hidden .PERIOD i can't find it in this image ,COMMA and i'm not sure you can .PERIOD 
only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there ,COMMA and that brings it out .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA danny and i were up at this same area one day ,COMMA and danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs ,COMMA which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it ,COMMA and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view .PERIOD 
and the people toiling up the mountain could see them ,COMMA these tiny little people up there ,COMMA incredibly halfway up the cliff .PERIOD 
how did they get there ?QUESTIONMARK do i have to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth .PERIOD 
you can get another angle on danny's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there .PERIOD 
and you need to know that danny's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine ,COMMA that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day ,COMMA and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate .PERIOD 
this is all forest service land .PERIOD if you go up on top of those cliffs ,COMMA that's some of the long now land in those trees .PERIOD 
and if you go up there and look back ,COMMA then you'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain .PERIOD 
that's the long view .PERIOD that's <NUM> miles to the horizon .PERIOD 
and that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs .PERIOD 
that's a different place to be .PERIOD it's <NUM> feet and it's exquisite .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs ,COMMA it's <NUM> foot ,COMMA just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker's foot ,COMMA there is a 600-foot drop .PERIOD he's ambling on over to zander's siq .PERIOD 
that's what it looks like looking down it .PERIOD 
we should probably put in a rail or something .PERIOD 
you also see there a bighorn sheep .PERIOD 
their herd was reintroduced from wyoming .PERIOD 
and they're doing pretty well ,COMMA but they've got a bit of trouble .PERIOD 
this is danny hillis ,COMMA and he's figuring out a design problem .PERIOD 
he's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .PERIOD 
because the real peak is hidden around the corner .PERIOD 
this is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest .PERIOD 
and as it turned out the answer is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak ,COMMA and that might be conjured with .PERIOD 
we gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this .PERIOD 
one is the experience of the mountain .PERIOD 
in the front ,COMMA there are <NUM> ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air .PERIOD 
one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch ,COMMA and i'll take you there for a minute .PERIOD 
it's a very nice ranch .PERIOD 
alfalfa and cattle ,COMMA run by paul and ronnie brenham ,COMMA and it's pretty idyllic .PERIOD it's also hard work .PERIOD 
and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going .PERIOD 
this is their view to the west of the schell creek range .PERIOD 
and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end ,COMMA you'll see what the valley used to look like .PERIOD 
and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley ,COMMA because those <NUM> ranches with their <NUM> acres dominate a <NUM> square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on ,COMMA and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition ,COMMA and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park ,COMMA and it would double the size of great basin national park .PERIOD that would be swell .PERIOD 
the clock experience should be profound ,COMMA but from the outside it should be invisible .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave .PERIOD 
it's only about <NUM> feet deep ,COMMA but what if it were deepened from inside ?QUESTIONMARK 
you excavated from somewhere ,COMMA came up from inside and deepened it .PERIOD 
and then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in ,COMMA that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite .PERIOD 
you'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the <NUM> year clock .PERIOD 
and it's not a mine .PERIOD this would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain ,COMMA and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside .PERIOD 
this is architecture not made by building ,COMMA but by what you very carefully take away .PERIOD 
so that's what the mountain taught us .PERIOD 
all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them .PERIOD 
it's not a clock in a mountain -- it's a mountain clock .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the tewa indians in the southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything .PERIOD 
they say ,COMMA pin peya obe -- welcome to the mountain .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i have ,COMMA like ,COMMA a thing about sleeping .PERIOD 
i don't sleep that much ,COMMA and i've come to this thing about ,COMMA like ,COMMA not sleeping much as being a great virtue ,COMMA after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment ,COMMA or something .PERIOD 
and now i really like sort of sitting up ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
but for years i've been sitting up and i think that ,COMMA like ,COMMA my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia .PERIOD 
i lie awake .PERIOD i think thoughts .PERIOD i walk aimlessly .PERIOD 
sometimes i used to walk more at night .PERIOD 
i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting .PERIOD 
and sometimes -- actually ,COMMA once it was on page six in the post ,COMMA that i was cruising this guy ,COMMA like ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on .PERIOD 
and so i was following this guy .PERIOD 
and i took a picture of his shoes ,COMMA and we thanked each other and just went on our way .PERIOD 
but i do that all the time .PERIOD 
as a matter of fact ,COMMA i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye .PERIOD 
because i feel like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there are so many images out there ,COMMA so many clothes out there .PERIOD 
and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken ,COMMA of course ,COMMA or very ,COMMA very surprising .PERIOD 
and so i'd make the car stop ,COMMA and i'd get out of the car and walk ,COMMA and see that in fact there wasn't a hole ,COMMA but it was a trick of my eye ,COMMA it was a shadow ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
or if there was a hole i'd think like ,COMMA oh damn ,COMMA there was actually someone thought of that thought already .PERIOD 
someone made that mistake already so i can't do it anymore .PERIOD 
it does not come for me from research .PERIOD 
i don't get necessarily inspired by research .PERIOD 
as a matter of fact ,COMMA one of the most fun things i've ever ,COMMA ever done in my whole life ,COMMA was this christmas season at the guggenheim in new york .PERIOD 
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from juilliard .PERIOD 
and i did like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the narrator ,COMMA and i read it .PERIOD 
and i saw this really smart critic who i love .PERIOD 
this woman ,COMMA joan acocella ,COMMA who's a friend of mine ,COMMA and she came backstage and she said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you know ,COMMA isaac ,COMMA did you know that ,COMMA talking about stalinism and talking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like the '30s in russia .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA how do i know about stalinism ?QUESTIONMARK 
i know about a wolf and a bird and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he ate the bird ,COMMA and then in the end you hear ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you hear the bird squeaking ,COMMA or something ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i don't really know that .PERIOD i don't really -- actually i do my own kind of research ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
if i'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera ,COMMA or something like that ,COMMA i will do a lot of research ,COMMA because it's interesting ,COMMA not because it's what i'm supposed to do .PERIOD 
i'm very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very inspired by movies .PERIOD 
the color of movies and the way light makes the colors ,COMMA light from behind the projection ,COMMA or light from the projection ,COMMA makes the colors look so impossible .PERIOD 
and anyway ,COMMA roll this little clip ,COMMA i'll just show you .PERIOD 
i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot .PERIOD 
because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time .PERIOD 
whether they're kind of glorified in this way ,COMMA or whether they're kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA ironically glorified ,COMMA or whether they're ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of denigrated ,COMMA or ironically denigrated .PERIOD 
i go back to color all the time .PERIOD 
color is something that motivates me a lot .PERIOD 
it's rarely color that i find in nature ,COMMA although ,COMMA you know ,COMMA juxtaposed next to artificial color ,COMMA natural color is so beautiful .PERIOD 
so that's what i do .PERIOD i study color a lot .PERIOD 
but for the most part ,COMMA i think ,COMMA like ,COMMA how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood ?QUESTIONMARK 
how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA that's just not possible ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and so that's what makes me lie awake at night ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
i want to show you -- i'm also like a big -- i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often ,COMMA and that's another thing that motivates me a lot .PERIOD 
people say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA do that .PERIOD an astrologer tells me to do something .PERIOD 
so i do it .PERIOD 
when i was about <NUM> ,COMMA an astrologer told me that i was going to meet the man of my dreams ,COMMA and that his name was going to be eric ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for years i would go to bars and ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA anyone i met whose name was eric i was humping immediately ,COMMA or something .PERIOD 
and there were times when i was actually so desperate i would just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA walk into a room and just go like ,COMMA eric !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and anybody who would turn around i would ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA make a beeline for .PERIOD 
and i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago .PERIOD 
the last card he pulled ,COMMA which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know ,COMMA sort of spats and this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a minstrel singer ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy thing where i do a cabaret act .PERIOD 
very embarrassing .PERIOD 
 :COLON thank you .PERIOD we can do anything you ask .PERIOD 
the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother .PERIOD 
it's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers .PERIOD 
and this has to do with being happy ,COMMA i swear .PERIOD 
and we were getting serious ,COMMA so we decided to invite them all to dinner ,COMMA our parents .PERIOD 
and we ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of introduced them to each other .PERIOD 
my mother was ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA very sensitive to his mother ,COMMA who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA homosexuality ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so my mother was a little offended .PERIOD she turned to her and she said ,COMMA are you kidding ?QUESTIONMARK they have the greatest life together .PERIOD 
they eat out ,COMMA they see shows .PERIOD 
they eat out ,COMMA they see shows .PERIOD 
that's the name of the show ,COMMA they eat out ,COMMA they -- that's on my tombstone when i die .PERIOD 
he ate out ,COMMA he saw shows ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so in editing these clips ,COMMA i didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe's pub .PERIOD 
so you'll have to ,COMMA like ,COMMA go check it out and come see me or something .PERIOD 
because it's mortifying ,COMMA and yet it feels . .PERIOD 
i don't know how to put this .PERIOD 
i feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and at least ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in my case ,COMMA because if i just do one thing all the time ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA i get very ,COMMA very bored .PERIOD i bore very easily .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA i don't say that i do everything well ,COMMA i just say that i do a lot of things ,COMMA that's all .PERIOD 
except ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA that's what staying up every night is about .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA looking back and thinking ,COMMA what a fool you made of yourself ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
but i guess that's okay .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything ,COMMA and not just one ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
you don't master feeling lousy about one thing .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD 
i will show you this next thing ,COMMA speaking of costumes for operas .PERIOD 
i do work with different choreographers .PERIOD 
i work with twyla tharp a lot ,COMMA and i work with mark morris a lot ,COMMA who is one of my best friends .PERIOD 
and i designed three operas with him ,COMMA and the most recent one ,COMMA king arthur .PERIOD 
i'd been very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager .PERIOD 
i went to performing arts high school ,COMMA where i was an actor .PERIOD 
and many of my friends were ballet dancers .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA i don't know where inspiration comes from .PERIOD 
i don't know where it comes from .PERIOD 
i started making puppets when i was a kid .PERIOD 
maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from ,COMMA puppets ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
and then performing arts high school .PERIOD 
there i was in high school ,COMMA meeting dancers and acting .PERIOD 
and somehow ,COMMA from there ,COMMA i got interested in design .PERIOD 
i went to parsons school of design and then i began my career as a designer .PERIOD 
i don't really think of myself as a designer ,COMMA i don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer .PERIOD 
i think of myself as a . .PERIOD i don't know what i think of myself as .PERIOD 
it's just that .PERIOD 
but i must say ,COMMA this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time ,COMMA that is what -- i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer .PERIOD 
you always have to be slightly bored with everything .PERIOD 
and if you're not ,COMMA you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything .PERIOD 
but i am really a little bored with everything .PERIOD 
i always say to my partner ,COMMA marisa gardini ,COMMA who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .PERIOD 
and she makes all the deals .PERIOD 
and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program .PERIOD 
and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing ,COMMA and do another thing and talk about it ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i had this tv .PERIOD show .PERIOD 
and that was a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very big part of my process .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA could you roll the clip ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is one of my favorite clips of rosie .PERIOD 
isaac mizrahi :COLON we're back on the set .PERIOD 
rosie o'donnell :COLON hello ,COMMA ben .PERIOD 
look how cute she looks with this ,COMMA just a slick back .PERIOD 
man :COLON her grandmother says ,COMMA delish !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
ah ,COMMA wow ,COMMA delish .PERIOD all right .PERIOD so now where should i position myself ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want to stay out of the way .PERIOD 
i don't want to be -- okay .PERIOD here we go .PERIOD 
do you get nervous ,COMMA ashleigh ?QUESTIONMARK 
ashleigh :COLON doing what ?QUESTIONMARK 
a :COLON cutting hair ?QUESTIONMARK never ,COMMA never .PERIOD 
i don't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous .PERIOD 
you look so cute already ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
rod :COLON you like it ?QUESTIONMARK all right .PERIOD 
do you have a problem with looking cute ?QUESTIONMARK you want to look cute .PERIOD 
rod :COLON of course i want to look cute .PERIOD 
rod :COLON no ,COMMA not me ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow ,COMMA like ,COMMA really messed up ,COMMA you know what i mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there's got to be some way to do that ,COMMA rosie .PERIOD 
because just because if you're fabulously rich ,COMMA and fabulously famous ,COMMA does that mean you shouldn't have kids ,COMMA because you know they're going to end up getting messed up ?QUESTIONMARK 
rod :COLON no ,COMMA but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
but you have to make the decision for yourself .PERIOD 
my kids are seven ,COMMA who the hell knows .PERIOD 
they're going to be like <NUM> and in rehab .PERIOD 
and they're going to be playing this clip :COLON i'm such a good mother .PERIOD 
my god ,COMMA this is the shortest i've ever had .PERIOD 
it looks good ,COMMA yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
a :COLON i was going to ask you ,COMMA has your hair ever been -- rod :COLON no !EXCLAMATIONMARK it's all right -- go crazy .PERIOD 
i feel like it needs to be a little closer down here .PERIOD 
are you freaking out ?QUESTIONMARK you look so cute .PERIOD 
rod :COLON no ,COMMA i love it .PERIOD it's the new me .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA it's so fabulous !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
rod :COLON flock of rosie .PERIOD wooo !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so by the way .PERIOD of all the most unboring things in the world ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that .PERIOD 
that is not boring .PERIOD that is nothing if it's not boring .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i read this great quote the other day ,COMMA which was ,COMMA style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die .PERIOD 
right ?QUESTIONMARK and then i realized ,COMMA that was on my website ,COMMA and then it said ,COMMA like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the quote was attributed to me and i thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i said something ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in an interview .PERIOD 
i forgot that i said that .PERIOD but it's really true .PERIOD 
i want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye .PERIOD 
and i often look at things as though they're food .PERIOD 
like i say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you know ,COMMA would you serve a rotten chicken ?QUESTIONMARK 
then how could you serve ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a beat up old dress or something .PERIOD 
how could you show a beat up old dress ?QUESTIONMARK 
i always relate things to kitchen-ry .PERIOD 
and so i think that's what it all boils down to .PERIOD 
everything boils down to that .PERIOD 
so check this out .PERIOD 
it's ,COMMA like ,COMMA this website .PERIOD 
it's a polymathematical website .PERIOD 
we actually shoot segments like tv .PERIOD show segments .PERIOD 
and it's kind of my favorite thing in the world .PERIOD 
and it just began like in the beginning of february .PERIOD so who knows ?QUESTIONMARK 
and again ,COMMA i don't say it's good ,COMMA i just think it's not boring ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and here is the last bit .PERIOD 
i have to tell you ,COMMA i make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time .PERIOD 
chef :COLON do you ?QUESTIONMARK 
chef :COLON oh .PERIOD 
you can't find buttermilk at citarella ;SEMICOLON you can't find buttermilk .PERIOD 
chef :COLON you can't ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's always low-fat buttermilk .PERIOD 
chef :COLON no ,COMMA but that's all it is .PERIOD 
is that all it is ?QUESTIONMARK 
chef :COLON oh ,COMMA you don't know ?QUESTIONMARK let me tell you something .PERIOD 
let me tell you something interesting .PERIOD 
you know what ?QUESTIONMARK stop laughing .PERIOD it's not funny .PERIOD 
just because i don't know that whole -- that there's no such thing as whole buttermilk .PERIOD 
sorry ,COMMA what ?QUESTIONMARK 
chef :COLON well ,COMMA here's the deal .PERIOD let me tell you the deal .PERIOD 
in the old days when they used to make butter ,COMMA you know how you make butter ?QUESTIONMARK 
churns ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD 
chef :COLON so you take heavy ,COMMA high-fat milk ,COMMA which is cream ,COMMA and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water .PERIOD 
the liquid is actually that clear liquid .PERIOD 
if you've ever overbeaten your whipped cream ,COMMA it's actually buttermilk .PERIOD 
and that's what it was in the early days .PERIOD 
and that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk .PERIOD 
excuse me ,COMMA i didn't know .PERIOD all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
chef :COLON the reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA it is ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD 
so who would think that it was low-fat ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
happy ted .PERIOD it's so wonderful here .PERIOD i love it .PERIOD i love it .PERIOD i love it .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD bye .PERIOD 
have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decade ?QUESTIONMARK 
or how could we have better prepared for that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well my personal story ,COMMA my personal journey ,COMMA what brings me to the ted stage here today ,COMMA is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decades ,COMMA at least ,COMMA and beyond .PERIOD 
i want to share some of that story with you ,COMMA but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in muslim-majority societies .PERIOD 
so let me begin by first of all giving a very ,COMMA very brief history of time ,COMMA if i may indulge .PERIOD 
in medieval societies there were defined allegiances .PERIOD 
an identity was defined primarily by religion .PERIOD 
and then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a european nation-state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity .PERIOD 
so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity ,COMMA and the nation-state reflected that .PERIOD 
in the age of globalization ,COMMA we moved on .PERIOD 
i call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from multi-racial ,COMMA multi-ethnic backgrounds ,COMMA but all be equal as citizens in a state .PERIOD 
you could be american-italian ;SEMICOLON you could be american-irish ;SEMICOLON you could be british-pakistani .PERIOD 
how i define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances ,COMMA where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives .PERIOD 
now this is not all necessarily good news ,COMMA because it's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love .PERIOD 
but actually it's my belief that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior ,COMMA up until now ,COMMA up until recent times ,COMMA up until the last six months ,COMMA the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances ,COMMA using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies ,COMMA those who've been benefiting from this have been extremists .PERIOD 
and that's something which i'd like to elaborate on .PERIOD 
now i should know ,COMMA because for <NUM> years of my life ,COMMA i was involved in an extreme islamist organization .PERIOD 
and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders ,COMMA and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith ,COMMA and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists across the world .PERIOD 
and my story ,COMMA my personal story ,COMMA is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i'm attempting to elaborate upon here .PERIOD 
i was ,COMMA by the way -- i'm an essex lad ,COMMA born and raised in essex in the uk .PERIOD 
anyone who's from england knows the reputation we have from essex .PERIOD 
at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA i was recruiting people from cambridge university to this organization .PERIOD 
at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA i was on the national leadership of this organization in the uk .PERIOD 
at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA i was co-founding this organization in pakistan .PERIOD 
at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA i was co-founding this organization in denmark .PERIOD 
now that journey ,COMMA and what took me from essex all the way across the world -- by the way ,COMMA we were laughing at democratic activists .PERIOD 
we felt they were from the age of yesteryear .PERIOD 
we felt that they were out of date .PERIOD 
i learned how to use email from the extremist organization that i used .PERIOD 
i learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected .PERIOD 
eventually i was detected ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in egypt .PERIOD 
but the way in which i learned to use technology to my advantage was because i was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation-state .PERIOD 
so as i said ,COMMA we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it .PERIOD 
and it's not just islamist extremists that did this .PERIOD 
but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late ,COMMA far-right fascism is also on the rise .PERIOD 
a form of anti-islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it's transnational .PERIOD 
and the consequences that this is having is that it's affecting the political climate across europe .PERIOD 
what's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms ,COMMA individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another ,COMMA have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become ,COMMA or are becoming ,COMMA mainstream .PERIOD 
because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .PERIOD 
if you look at the rise of far-right fascism across europe of late ,COMMA you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics ,COMMA yet the phenomenon is transnational .PERIOD 
in others ,COMMA headscarves are being banned .PERIOD 
in others ,COMMA kosher and halal meat are being banned ,COMMA as we speak .PERIOD 
and on the flip side ,COMMA we have transnational islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies .PERIOD 
and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .PERIOD 
now that never would have been possible before .PERIOD 
they would have felt isolated ,COMMA until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon .PERIOD 
where does that leave democracy aspirants ?QUESTIONMARK 
well i believe they're getting left far behind .PERIOD 
and i'll give you an example here at this stage .PERIOD 
if any of you remembers the christmas day bomb plot :COLON there's a man called anwar al-awlaki .PERIOD 
as an american citizen ,COMMA ethnically a yemeni ,COMMA in hiding currently in yemen ,COMMA who inspired a nigerian ,COMMA son of the head of nigeria's national bank .PERIOD 
this nigerian student studied in london ,COMMA trained in yemen ,COMMA boarded a flight in amsterdam to attack america .PERIOD 
in the meanwhile ,COMMA the old mentality with a capital o ,COMMA was represented by his father ,COMMA the head of the nigerian bank ,COMMA warning the cia that his own son was about to attack ,COMMA and this warning fell on deaf ears .PERIOD 
the old mentality with a capital o ,COMMA as represented by the nation-state ,COMMA not yet fully into the age of behavior ,COMMA not recognizing the power of transnational social movements ,COMMA got left behind .PERIOD 
and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america .PERIOD 
again with the example of the far right :COLON that we find ,COMMA ironically ,COMMA xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization .PERIOD 
so why are they succeeding ?QUESTIONMARK 
well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this .PERIOD 
and a social movement is comprised ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA it's comprised of four main characteristics .PERIOD 
it's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .PERIOD 
i'll talk you through one example ,COMMA and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of ,COMMA and that's the example of al-qaeda .PERIOD 
if i asked you to think of the ideas of al-qaeda ,COMMA that's something that comes to your mind immediately .PERIOD 
if i ask you to think of their narratives -- the west being at war with islam ,COMMA the need to defend islam against the west -- these narratives ,COMMA they come to your mind immediately .PERIOD 
incidentally ,COMMA the difference between ideas and narratives :COLON the idea is the cause that one believes in ;SEMICOLON and the narrative is the way to sell that cause -- the propaganda ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA of the cause .PERIOD 
if i ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders ,COMMA they come to your mind immediately .PERIOD 
so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately .PERIOD 
and that's the power of social movements .PERIOD 
they're transnational ,COMMA and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA if i ask your minds to focus currently on pakistan ,COMMA and i ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan today ,COMMA you'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of benazir bhutto .PERIOD 
which means ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA that particular leader no longer exists .PERIOD 
one of the problems we're facing is ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA that there are no globalized ,COMMA youth-led ,COMMA grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across muslim-majority societies .PERIOD 
there is no equivalent of the al-qaeda ,COMMA without the terrorism ,COMMA for democracy across muslim-majority societies .PERIOD 
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground .PERIOD 
so that begs the next question .PERIOD 
why is it that extremist organizations ,COMMA whether of the far-right or of the islamist extremism -- islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society -- why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way ,COMMA whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i believe that's for four reasons .PERIOD 
i believe ,COMMA number one ,COMMA it's complacency .PERIOD 
because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power ,COMMA or have societies that are leading globalized ,COMMA powerful societies ,COMMA powerful countries .PERIOD 
and that level of complacency means they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture .PERIOD 
the second ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA is political correctness .PERIOD 
that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists .PERIOD 
yet actually ,COMMA whenever we talk about human rights ,COMMA we do say that human rights are universal .PERIOD 
but actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism .PERIOD 
and the third ,COMMA democratic choice in muslim-majority societies has been relegated to a political choice ,COMMA meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party ,COMMA but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party -- wanting to rule by military dictatorship .PERIOD 
and then you have a third party saying ,COMMA vote for us ;SEMICOLON we'll establish a theocracy .PERIOD 
so democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies .PERIOD 
and what happens as a result of this is ,COMMA when those parties are elected ,COMMA and inevitably they fail ,COMMA or inevitably they make political mistakes ,COMMA democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes .PERIOD 
and then people say ,COMMA we've tried democracy .PERIOD it doesn't really work .PERIOD 
let's bring the military back again .PERIOD 
and the fourth reason ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA is what i've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance .PERIOD 
what i mean by that is ,COMMA if the world superpower today was a communist ,COMMA it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism ,COMMA than it is today with the world superpower being america ,COMMA occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals .PERIOD 
so roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice ,COMMA not merely as a political choice .PERIOD 
is it just about grievances ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it just about a lack of education ?QUESTIONMARK 
well statistically ,COMMA the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated .PERIOD 
statistically ,COMMA they are educated ,COMMA on average ,COMMA above the education levels of western society .PERIOD 
anecdotally ,COMMA we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor ,COMMA well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia .PERIOD 
his deputy ,COMMA ayman al-zawahiri ,COMMA was a pediatrician -- not an ill-educated man .PERIOD 
international aid and development has been going on for years ,COMMA but extremism in those societies ,COMMA in many of those societies ,COMMA has been on the rise .PERIOD 
and what i believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground ,COMMA in addition to international aid ,COMMA in addition to education ,COMMA in addition to health .PERIOD 
not exclusive to these things ,COMMA but in addition to them ,COMMA is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground .PERIOD 
and this is where i believe neoconservatism had it upside-down .PERIOD 
neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .PERIOD 
whereas islamists and far-right organizations ,COMMA for decades ,COMMA have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots .PERIOD 
they've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots ,COMMA and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of islamism .PERIOD 
mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy ,COMMA rather than for a democratic uprising .PERIOD 
because since pre-partition ,COMMA they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground .PERIOD 
and what's needed is a genuine transnational youth-led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture -- which is necessarily more than just elections .PERIOD 
without human rights ,COMMA you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign .PERIOD 
without freedom of belief ,COMMA you don't have the right to join organizations .PERIOD 
so what's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture .PERIOD 
what that will do is avoid the problem i was talking about earlier ,COMMA where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy .PERIOD 
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level ,COMMA rather than merely on a political level ,COMMA a level above politics -- movements that are not political parties ,COMMA but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture .PERIOD 
what we'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here -- the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy ,COMMA not for a democracy .PERIOD 
but to get to that stage ,COMMA where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric ,COMMA but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship -- ie .PERIOD you're voting in a democracy ,COMMA in an existing democracy ,COMMA and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box .PERIOD 
to get to that stage ,COMMA we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground .PERIOD 
now to conclude ,COMMA how does that happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA egypt is a good starting point .PERIOD 
the arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning .PERIOD 
but what happened in the arab uprisings and what happened in egypt was particularly cathartic for me .PERIOD 
what happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal ,COMMA and that was to remove the leader .PERIOD 
we need to move one step beyond that now .PERIOD 
we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions ,COMMA loosely based political coalitions ,COMMA to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground .PERIOD 
because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator .PERIOD 
that doesn't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .PERIOD 
but generally ,COMMA the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region ,COMMA the middle east and north africa region .PERIOD 
so when arab socialism started in egypt ,COMMA it spread across the region .PERIOD 
and the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that .PERIOD 
but that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture .PERIOD 
and we've made a start for that in pakistan with a movement called khudi ,COMMA where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture .PERIOD 
and it's with that thought that i'll end .PERIOD 
and my time is up ,COMMA and thank you for your time .PERIOD 
i want to talk about the transformed media landscape ,COMMA and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation .PERIOD 
i'll start here .PERIOD last november there was a presidential election .PERIOD 
you probably read something about it in the papers .PERIOD 
and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression .PERIOD 
and so a plan came up to video the vote .PERIOD 
and the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places ,COMMA on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques ,COMMA and would upload this to a central place .PERIOD 
and that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes ,COMMA but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall .PERIOD 
so this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together .PERIOD 
what matters here isn't technical capital ,COMMA it's social capital .PERIOD 
these tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .PERIOD 
it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society .PERIOD 
it's when everybody is able to take them for granted .PERIOD 
because now that media is increasingly social ,COMMA innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together .PERIOD 
and so we're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere ,COMMA and moving from one spot to another .PERIOD 
that is a huge transformation .PERIOD 
not to put too fine a point on it ,COMMA the moment we're living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history .PERIOD 
there are only four periods in the last <NUM> years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution .PERIOD 
the first one is the famous one ,COMMA the printing press :COLON movable type ,COMMA oil-based inks ,COMMA that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside-down ,COMMA starting in the middle of the 1400s .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA a couple of hundred years ago ,COMMA there was innovation in two-way communication ,COMMA conversational media :COLON first the telegraph ,COMMA then the telephone .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA there was a revolution in recorded media other than print :COLON first photos ,COMMA then recorded sound ,COMMA then movies ,COMMA all encoded onto physical objects .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television .PERIOD 
this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .PERIOD 
this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with ,COMMA and are used to .PERIOD 
but there is a curious asymmetry here .PERIOD 
the media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups .PERIOD 
and the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .PERIOD 
if you want to have a conversation in this world ,COMMA you have it with one other person .PERIOD 
if you want to address a group ,COMMA you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group ,COMMA whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .PERIOD 
that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century .PERIOD 
and this is what changed .PERIOD 
this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick's map of the internet .PERIOD 
the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .PERIOD 
whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern ,COMMA and television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA magazines ,COMMA books ,COMMA gave us the one-to-many pattern ,COMMA the internet gives us the many-to-many pattern .PERIOD 
for the first time ,COMMA media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations .PERIOD 
that's one of the big changes .PERIOD 
the second big change is that ,COMMA as all media gets digitized ,COMMA the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media ,COMMA meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet ,COMMA magazines migrate to the internet ,COMMA movies migrate to the internet .PERIOD 
and that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium .PERIOD 
put another way ,COMMA media is increasingly less just a source of information ,COMMA and it is increasingly more a site of coordination ,COMMA because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well .PERIOD 
and the third big change is that members of the former audience ,COMMA as dan gilmore calls them ,COMMA can now also be producers and not consumers .PERIOD 
every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well ,COMMA because the same equipment -- phones ,COMMA computers -- let you consume and produce .PERIOD 
it's as if ,COMMA when you bought a book ,COMMA they threw in the printing press for free ;SEMICOLON it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons .PERIOD 
that is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to .PERIOD 
and it's not just internet or no internet .PERIOD 
we've had the internet in its public form for almost <NUM> years now ,COMMA and it's still changing as the media becomes more social .PERIOD 
it's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the internet well .PERIOD 
second story .PERIOD 
last may ,COMMA china in the sichuan province had a terrible earthquake ,COMMA <NUM> magnitude ,COMMA massive destruction in a wide area ,COMMA as the richter scale has it .PERIOD 
and the earthquake was reported as it was happening .PERIOD 
people were texting from their phones .PERIOD they were taking photos of buildings .PERIOD 
they were taking videos of buildings shaking .PERIOD 
they were uploading it to qq ,COMMA china's largest internet service .PERIOD 
they were twittering it .PERIOD 
and so as the quake was happening the news was reported .PERIOD 
and because of the social connections ,COMMA chinese students coming elsewhere ,COMMA and going to school ,COMMA or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in china -- there were people listening all over the world ,COMMA hearing this news .PERIOD 
the bbc got their first wind of the chinese quake from twitter .PERIOD 
twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us geological survey had anything up online for anybody to read .PERIOD 
the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened .PERIOD 
now they might have liked to have done that here ,COMMA rather than seeing these pictures go up online .PERIOD 
even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens ,COMMA rather than from the xinhua news agency .PERIOD 
and this stuff rippled like wildfire .PERIOD 
for a while there the top <NUM> most clicked links on twitter ,COMMA the global short messaging service -- nine of the top <NUM> links were about the quake .PERIOD 
people collating information ,COMMA pointing people to news sources ,COMMA pointing people to the us geological survey .PERIOD 
the 10th one was kittens on a treadmill ,COMMA but that's the internet for you .PERIOD 
but nine of the <NUM> in those first hours .PERIOD 
and within half a day donation sites were up ,COMMA and donations were pouring in from all around the world .PERIOD 
this was an incredible ,COMMA coordinated global response .PERIOD 
and the chinese then ,COMMA in one of their periods of media openness ,COMMA decided that they were going to let it go ,COMMA that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .PERIOD 
and then this happened .PERIOD 
people began to figure out ,COMMA in the sichuan provence ,COMMA that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed -- because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day -- the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code .PERIOD 
and so they started ,COMMA the citizen journalists started reporting that as well .PERIOD and there was an incredible picture .PERIOD 
you may have seen in on the front page of the new york times .PERIOD 
a local official literally prostrated himself in the street ,COMMA in front of these protesters ,COMMA in order to get them to go away .PERIOD 
but these are people who have been radicalized ,COMMA because ,COMMA thanks to the one child policy ,COMMA they have lost everyone in their next generation .PERIOD 
someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose .PERIOD 
and finally the chinese cracked down .PERIOD 
that was enough of citizen media .PERIOD 
they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .PERIOD 
china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship in the world ,COMMA using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china .PERIOD 
and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals ,COMMA it mostly comes in from the outside world ,COMMA it comes in relatively sparse chunks ,COMMA and it comes in relatively slowly .PERIOD 
and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country .PERIOD 
but like the maginot line ,COMMA the great firewall of china was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge ,COMMA because not one of those four things was true in this environment .PERIOD 
the media was produced locally .PERIOD it was produced by amateurs .PERIOD 
it was produced quickly .PERIOD and it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared .PERIOD 
and so now the chinese government ,COMMA who for a dozen years ,COMMA has quite successfully filtered the web ,COMMA is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services ,COMMA because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way .PERIOD 
and in fact that is happening this week .PERIOD 
on the 20th anniversary of tiananmen they just ,COMMA two days ago ,COMMA announced that they were simply shutting down access to twitter ,COMMA because there was no way to filter it other than that .PERIOD 
they had to turn the spigot entirely off .PERIOD 
now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages .PERIOD 
they also affect people who want to send messages ,COMMA because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole ,COMMA not just a particular strategy .PERIOD 
the classic media problem ,COMMA from the 20th century is ,COMMA how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network .PERIOD 
and here is the twentieth century answer .PERIOD 
bundle up the message .PERIOD send the same message to everybody .PERIOD 
national message .PERIOD targeted individuals .PERIOD 
relatively sparse number of producers .PERIOD 
very expensive to do ,COMMA so there is not a lot of competition .PERIOD 
this is how you reach people .PERIOD 
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global ,COMMA social ,COMMA ubiquitous and cheap .PERIOD 
now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world ,COMMA to the distributed collection of the audience ,COMMA are now used to this change .PERIOD 
the audience can talk back .PERIOD 
and that's a little freaky .PERIOD but you can get used to it after a while ,COMMA as people do .PERIOD 
but that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of .PERIOD 
the really crazy change is here :COLON it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other ,COMMA the fact that former consumers are now producers ,COMMA the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another ;SEMICOLON because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals ,COMMA and because the size of the network ,COMMA the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants ,COMMA meaning that the network ,COMMA when it grows large ,COMMA grows very ,COMMA very large .PERIOD 
as recently at last decade ,COMMA most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals .PERIOD 
those days are over ,COMMA never to return .PERIOD 
it is the green lines now ,COMMA that are the source of the free content ,COMMA which brings me to my last story .PERIOD 
we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign .PERIOD 
and i don't mean most imaginative use in politics -- i mean most imaginative use ever .PERIOD 
and one of the things obama did ,COMMA was they famously ,COMMA the obama campaign did ,COMMA was they famously put up mybarackobamacom ,COMMA mybocom and millions of citizens rushed in to participate ,COMMA and to try and figure out how to help .PERIOD 
an incredible conversation sprung up there .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA this time last year ,COMMA obama announced that he was going to change his vote on fisa ,COMMA the foreign intelligence surveillance act .PERIOD 
by the summer ,COMMA in the middle of the general campaign ,COMMA he said ,COMMA i've thought about the issue more .PERIOD i've changed my mind .PERIOD 
i'm going to vote for this bill .PERIOD 
and many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk .PERIOD 
please get fisa right .PERIOD 
within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybocom ;SEMICOLON within weeks of its being created it was the largest group .PERIOD 
obama had to issue a press release .PERIOD 
i understand where you are coming from .PERIOD 
but having considered it all ,COMMA i'm still going to vote the way i'm going to vote .PERIOD 
but i wanted to reach out to you and say ,COMMA i understand that you disagree with me ,COMMA and i'm going to take my lumps on this one .PERIOD 
this didn't please anybody .PERIOD but then a funny thing happened in the conversation .PERIOD 
people in that group realized that obama had never shut them down .PERIOD 
nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join ,COMMA to deny its existence ,COMMA to delete it ,COMMA to take to off the site .PERIOD 
they had understood that their role with mybocom was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters .PERIOD 
and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media .PERIOD 
in a world where media is global ,COMMA social ,COMMA ubiquitous and cheap ,COMMA in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants ,COMMA in that world ,COMMA media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .PERIOD 
it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups .PERIOD 
and the choice we face ,COMMA i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world ,COMMA isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in .PERIOD 
the question we all face now is ,COMMA how can we make best use of this media ?QUESTIONMARK 
even though it means changing the way we've always done it .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
let me talk about india through the evolution of ideas .PERIOD 
now i believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society ,COMMA especially an open democratic society ,COMMA it's only when ideas take root that things change .PERIOD 
slowly ideas lead to ideology ,COMMA lead to policies that lead to actions .PERIOD 
in <NUM> this country went through a great depression ,COMMA which led to all the ideas of the state and social security ,COMMA and all the other things that happened in roosevelt's time .PERIOD 
in the 1980s we had the reagan revolution ,COMMA which lead to deregulation .PERIOD 
so ideas change states .PERIOD 
and i looked at india and said ,COMMA really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on india .PERIOD 
these ideas have brought together something which has made india happen the way it is today .PERIOD 
the second set of ideas i call ideas in progress .PERIOD 
those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet .PERIOD 
the third set of ideas are what i call as ideas that we argue about -- those are ideas where we have a fight ,COMMA an ideological battle about how to do things .PERIOD 
and the fourth thing ,COMMA which i believe is most important ,COMMA is the ideas that we need to anticipate .PERIOD 
because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having ,COMMA you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently .PERIOD 
now in india's case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .PERIOD 
the first is really the notion of people .PERIOD 
in the '60s and '70s we thought of people as a burden .PERIOD 
today we talk of people as an asset .PERIOD 
we talk of people as human capital .PERIOD 
and i believe this change in the mindset ,COMMA of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital ,COMMA has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian mindset .PERIOD 
and this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that india is going through a demographic dividend .PERIOD 
as healthcare improves ,COMMA as infant mortality goes down ,COMMA fertility rates start dropping .PERIOD and india is experiencing that .PERIOD 
india is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
what is unique about this demographic dividend is that india will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA it will be the only young country in an aging world .PERIOD 
and this is very important .PERIOD at the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in india ,COMMA there are actually two demographic curves .PERIOD 
one is in the south and in the west of india ,COMMA which is already going to be fully expensed by <NUM> ,COMMA because in that part of the country ,COMMA the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a west european country .PERIOD 
then there is the whole northern india ,COMMA which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend .PERIOD 
but a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital .PERIOD 
only if the people have education ,COMMA they have good health ,COMMA they have infrastructure ,COMMA they have roads to go to work ,COMMA they have lights to study at night -- only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA if you don't really invest in the human capital ,COMMA the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster .PERIOD 
therefore india is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster .PERIOD 
the second thing in india has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
when india got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot ,COMMA as people who would exploit .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA after <NUM> years ,COMMA because of the rise of entrepreneurship ,COMMA entrepreneurs have become role models ,COMMA and they are contributing hugely to the society .PERIOD 
the third big thing i believe that has changed india is our attitude towards the english language .PERIOD 
english language was seen as a language of the imperialists .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA with globalization ,COMMA with outsourcing ,COMMA english has become a language of aspiration .PERIOD 
this has made it something that everybody wants to learn .PERIOD 
the next thing is technology .PERIOD 
forty years back ,COMMA computers were seen as something which was forbidding ,COMMA something which was intimidating ,COMMA something that reduced jobs .PERIOD 
today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month ,COMMA of which <NUM> percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people don't have credit history .PERIOD 
forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than <NUM> cents at each recharge .PERIOD 
that is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible .PERIOD 
and therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering .PERIOD 
twenty years back ,COMMA when there was a report on bank computerization ,COMMA they didn't name the report as a report on computers ,COMMA they call them as ledger posting machines .PERIOD 
they didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers .PERIOD 
and when they wanted to have more advanced ,COMMA more powerful computers they called them advanced ledger posting machines .PERIOD 
so we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment ,COMMA and really has changed the way indians think of technology .PERIOD 
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA after having lived for more than <NUM> years under the east india company and under imperial rule ,COMMA indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA as indian companies go abroad ,COMMA as indians come and work all over the world ,COMMA indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in .PERIOD 
and the fact that the demographics are in our favor ,COMMA because we are the only young country in an aging world ,COMMA makes globalization all the more attractive to indians .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA india has had the deepening of its democracy .PERIOD 
when democracy came to india <NUM> years back it was an elite concept .PERIOD 
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth .PERIOD 
but today democracy has become a bottom-up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice ,COMMA the benefits of being in an open society .PERIOD 
and therefore democracy has become embedded .PERIOD 
i believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital ,COMMA the rise of indian entrepreneurs ,COMMA the rise of english as a language of aspiration ,COMMA technology as something empowering ,COMMA globalization as a positive factor ,COMMA and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why india is today growing at rates it has never seen before .PERIOD 
but having said that ,COMMA then we come to what i call as ideas in progress .PERIOD 
those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society ,COMMA but you are not able to implement those things .PERIOD 
and really there are four things here .PERIOD 
for some reason ,COMMA whatever reason -- lack of money ,COMMA lack of priorities ,COMMA because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required .PERIOD 
but now i believe it's reached a point where it has become very important .PERIOD 
unfortunately the government schools don't function ,COMMA so children are going to private schools today .PERIOD 
even in the slums of india more than <NUM> percent of urban kids are going into private schools .PERIOD 
so there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work .PERIOD 
but having said that ,COMMA there is an enormous desire among everybody ,COMMA including the poor ,COMMA to educate their children .PERIOD 
so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented .PERIOD 
similarly ,COMMA infrastructure -- for a long time ,COMMA infrastructure was not a priority .PERIOD 
those of you who have been to india have seen that .PERIOD 
it's certainly not like china .PERIOD 
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .PERIOD 
it is reflected in the political statements .PERIOD 
<NUM> years back the political slogan was ,COMMA roti ,COMMA kapada ,COMMA makaan ,COMMA which meant ,COMMA food ,COMMA clothing and shelter .PERIOD 
and today's political slogan is ,COMMA bijli ,COMMA sadak ,COMMA pani ,COMMA which means electricity ,COMMA water and roads .PERIOD 
and that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted .PERIOD 
so i do believe this is an idea which has arrived ,COMMA but simply not implemented .PERIOD 
it's because gandhi believed in villages and because the british ruled from the cities ,COMMA therefore nehru thought of new delhi as an un-indian city .PERIOD 
for a long time we have neglected our cities .PERIOD 
and that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see .PERIOD 
and i think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA an idea which is arrived ,COMMA but not yet implemented .PERIOD 
the final thing is the notion of india as a single market -- because when you didn't think of india as a market ,COMMA you didn't really bother about a single market ,COMMA because it didn't really matter .PERIOD 
and therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products .PERIOD 
every province had its own market for agriculture .PERIOD 
increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that ,COMMA are moving towards creating india as a single market .PERIOD 
so there is a form of internal globalization which is happening ,COMMA which is as important as external globalization .PERIOD 
these four factors i believe -- the ones of primary education ,COMMA infrastructure ,COMMA urbanization ,COMMA and single market -- in my view are ideas in india which have been accepted ,COMMA but not implemented .PERIOD 
then we have what i believe are the ideas in conflict .PERIOD 
the ideas that we argue about .PERIOD 
these are the arguments we have which cause gridlock .PERIOD 
what are those ideas ?QUESTIONMARK one is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA are ideological issues .PERIOD 
because of the historical indian background ,COMMA in the caste system ,COMMA and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold ,COMMA a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we'll address that .PERIOD 
and it leads to reservations and other techniques .PERIOD 
it's also related to the way that we subsidize our people ,COMMA and all the left and right arguments that we have .PERIOD 
this policy is causing gridlock .PERIOD 
this is one of the factors which needs to be resolved .PERIOD 
the second one is the labor policies that we have ,COMMA which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies ,COMMA that <NUM> percent of indian labor is in the unorganized sector .PERIOD 
they have no benefits :COLON they don't have social security ;SEMICOLON they don't have pension ;SEMICOLON they don't have healthcare ;SEMICOLON none of those things .PERIOD 
this needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce ,COMMA you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised .PERIOD 
therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws ,COMMA which are not as onerous as they are today .PERIOD 
at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector ,COMMA and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .PERIOD 
the third thing is our higher education .PERIOD 
indian higher education is completely regulated .PERIOD 
it's very difficult to start a private university .PERIOD 
it's very difficult for a foreign university to come to india .PERIOD 
as a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with india's demands .PERIOD 
that is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address .PERIOD 
but most important i believe are the ideas we need to anticipate .PERIOD 
here india can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere ,COMMA and look at what needs to be done .PERIOD 
the first thing is ,COMMA we're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development .PERIOD 
so we can use technology for governance .PERIOD 
we can use technology for direct benefits .PERIOD 
we can use technology for transparency ,COMMA and many other things .PERIOD 
the second thing is ,COMMA the health issue .PERIOD 
india has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue ,COMMA the higher state of diabetes ,COMMA the higher state of obesity .PERIOD 
so there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases .PERIOD 
therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health .PERIOD 
we really need to put in place a strategy so that we don't go to the other extreme of health .PERIOD 
similarly today in the west you're seeing the problem of entitlement -- the cost of social security ,COMMA the cost of medicare ,COMMA the cost of medicaid .PERIOD 
therefore when you are a young country ,COMMA again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old .PERIOD 
and then again ,COMMA india does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty ,COMMA because it has to marry environment and development .PERIOD 
just to give an idea ,COMMA the world has to stabilize at something like <NUM> gigatons per year .PERIOD 
on a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year .PERIOD 
india is already at two tons per year .PERIOD 
but if india grows at something like eight percent ,COMMA income per year per person will go to <NUM> times by <NUM> .PERIOD 
so we're saying :COLON income growing at <NUM> times and no growth in carbon .PERIOD 
now why does this matter to you ?QUESTIONMARK 
number one ,COMMA this matters because this represents more than a billion people .PERIOD 
a billion people ,COMMA <NUM>/6th of the world population .PERIOD 
it matters because this is a democracy .PERIOD 
and it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible ,COMMA that you can have a democracy ,COMMA that you can have an open society ,COMMA and you can have growth .PERIOD 
it's important because if you solve these problems ,COMMA you can solve the problems of poverty in the world .PERIOD 
it's important because you need it to solve the world's environment problems .PERIOD 
if we really want to come to a point ,COMMA we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission ,COMMA we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like india .PERIOD 
you know if you look at the development in the west over <NUM> years ,COMMA the average growth may have been about two percent .PERIOD 
here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent .PERIOD 
when the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to <NUM> percent ,COMMA then per capita income is doubling every nine years .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity .PERIOD 
and you must have a clear strategy which is important for india and important for the world .PERIOD 
that is why i think all of you should be equally concerned with it as i am .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD we've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind .PERIOD 
and what i'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation ,COMMA how the will to survive can bring that out in people .PERIOD 
this is an incident which occurred on mount everest ;SEMICOLON it was the worst disaster in the history of everest .PERIOD 
and when it occurred ,COMMA i was the only doctor on the mountain .PERIOD 
so i'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA this is mount everest .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> feet high .PERIOD 
it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain .PERIOD hyakutake .PERIOD 
and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen ,COMMA and we should have listened to them .PERIOD 
everest is an extreme environment .PERIOD 
there's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level .PERIOD 
near the summit ,COMMA temperatures can be <NUM> degrees below zero .PERIOD 
you can have winds <NUM> to <NUM> miles an hour .PERIOD 
it's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars .PERIOD 
i remember one time being up near the summit ,COMMA i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle ,COMMA inside my down jacket ,COMMA only to discover that the water was already frozen solid .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA this is the route up everest .PERIOD 
it starts at base camp ,COMMA at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
camp one ,COMMA <NUM> feet higher .PERIOD 
camp two ,COMMA another <NUM> feet higher up ,COMMA what's called the western cwm .PERIOD 
campthree is at the base of lhotse ,COMMA which is the fourth highest mountain in the world ,COMMA but it's dwarfed by everest .PERIOD 
and then camp four is the highest camp ;SEMICOLON that's <NUM> feet short of the summit .PERIOD 
this is a view of base camp .PERIOD 
this is pitched on a glacier at <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
it's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload .PERIOD 
and this is what they unloaded for me :COLON i had four yak loads of medical supplies ,COMMA which are dumped in a tent ,COMMA and here i am trying to arrange things .PERIOD 
this was our expedition .PERIOD 
it was a national geographic expedition ,COMMA but it was organized by the explorers club .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA after actually two months of preparation ,COMMA we built our camps all the way up the mountain .PERIOD 
this is a view looking up the icefall ,COMMA the first <NUM> feet of the climb up from base camp .PERIOD 
and here's a picture in the icefall ;SEMICOLON it's a waterfall ,COMMA but it's frozen ,COMMA but it moves very slowly ,COMMA and it actually changes every day .PERIOD 
when you're in it ,COMMA you're like a rat in a maze ;SEMICOLON you can't even see over the top .PERIOD 
this is near the top of the icefall .PERIOD 
you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen .PERIOD 
that way ,COMMA it's less likely to tumble down on you .PERIOD 
these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up .PERIOD 
this is me crossing a crevasse .PERIOD 
we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached .PERIOD 
that's another crevasse .PERIOD 
some of these things are <NUM> stories deep or more ,COMMA and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over ,COMMA we would never do it .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD this is camp one .PERIOD 
it's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall .PERIOD 
these are climbers moving up the lhotse face ,COMMA that mountain toward camp three .PERIOD 
they're on fixed ropes here .PERIOD 
a fall here ,COMMA if you weren't roped in ,COMMA would be <NUM> feet down .PERIOD 
this is a view taken from camp three .PERIOD 
you can see the lhotse face is in profile ,COMMA it's about a <NUM> degree angle .PERIOD it takes two days to climb it ,COMMA so you put the camp halfway through .PERIOD 
there's no ice over it .PERIOD 
and that's because everest is so high ,COMMA it's in the jet stream ,COMMA and winds are constantly scouring the face ,COMMA so no snow gets to accumulate .PERIOD 
what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit .PERIOD 
this is on the way up from camp three to camp four ,COMMA moving in ,COMMA up through the clouds .PERIOD 
and this is at camp four .PERIOD 
once you get to camp four ,COMMA you have maybe <NUM> hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not .PERIOD 
everybody's on oxygen ,COMMA your supplies are limited ,COMMA and you either have to go up or go down ,COMMA make that decision very quickly .PERIOD 
this is a picture of rob hall .PERIOD 
he was the leader of the new zealand team .PERIOD 
this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i'll tell you about .PERIOD 
these are some climbers waiting to go to the summit .PERIOD 
they're up at camp four ,COMMA and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the wind does die down at night .PERIOD 
it becomes very calm ,COMMA there's no wind at all .PERIOD 
this looks like a good chance to go for the summit .PERIOD 
so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the triangular face .PERIOD 
it's the first part of climb .PERIOD 
it's done in the dark ,COMMA because it's actually less steep than what comes next ,COMMA and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark .PERIOD 
so that's what happened .PERIOD 
the climbers got on the southeast ridge .PERIOD 
this is the view looking at the southeast ridge .PERIOD 
from here ,COMMA it's about <NUM> feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit .PERIOD 
a storm blew in that no one was anticipating .PERIOD 
you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit .PERIOD 
and there were climbers on that summit ridge .PERIOD 
this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before ,COMMA and you can see i've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather .PERIOD 
you can see on this climber ,COMMA we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks ,COMMA very lightweight -- and we're not carrying much else .PERIOD 
this is all you've got .PERIOD you're very exposed on the summit ridge .PERIOD 
this is on the way toward the summit ,COMMA on that 1500-foot bridge .PERIOD 
all the climbers here are climbing unroped ,COMMA and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody ,COMMA you'd wind up just pulling them off with you .PERIOD 
so each person climbs individually .PERIOD 
and it's not a straight path at all ,COMMA it's very difficult climbing ,COMMA and there's always the risk of falling on either side .PERIOD 
if you fall to your left ,COMMA you're going to fall <NUM> feet into nepal ;SEMICOLON if you fall to your right ,COMMA you're going to fall <NUM> feet into tibet .PERIOD 
so it's probably better to fall into tibet because you'll live longer .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD those climbers were up near the summit ,COMMA along that summit ridge that you see up there ,COMMA and i was down here in camp three .PERIOD 
my expedition was down in camp three ,COMMA while these guys were up there in the storm .PERIOD 
the storm was so fierce that we had to lay ,COMMA fully dressed ,COMMA fully equipped ,COMMA laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain .PERIOD 
it was the worst winds i've ever seen .PERIOD 
and the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher ,COMMA <NUM> feet higher ,COMMA and completely exposed to the elements .PERIOD 
we were in radio contact with some of them .PERIOD 
this is a view taken along the summit ridge .PERIOD 
rob hall ,COMMA we heard by radio ,COMMA was up here ,COMMA at this point in the storm with doug hansen .PERIOD 
and we heard that rob was ok ,COMMA but doug was too weak to come down .PERIOD 
he was exhausted ,COMMA and rob was staying with him .PERIOD 
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers ,COMMA another climber ,COMMA had collapsed in the snow and was dead .PERIOD 
there were still <NUM> other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition .PERIOD 
they were lost .PERIOD there was total confusion on the mountain ;SEMICOLON all the stories were confusing ,COMMA most of them were conflicting .PERIOD 
we really had no idea what was going on during that storm .PERIOD 
we were just hunkered down in our tents at camp three .PERIOD 
our two strongest climbers ,COMMA todd burleson and pete athans ,COMMA decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going .PERIOD 
they tried to radio a message to rob hall ,COMMA who was a superb climber stuck ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA with a weak climber up near the summit .PERIOD 
i expected them to say to rob ,COMMA hold on .PERIOD we're coming .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA what they said was ,COMMA leave doug and come down yourself .PERIOD 
there's no chance of saving him ,COMMA and just try to save yourself at this point .PERIOD 
and rob got that message ,COMMA but his answer was ,COMMA we're both listening .PERIOD 
todd and pete got up to the summit ridge ,COMMA up in here ,COMMA and it was a scene of complete chaos up there .PERIOD 
but they did what they could to stabilize the people .PERIOD 
i gave them radio advice from camp three ,COMMA and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power .PERIOD 
the ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four .PERIOD 
so the climbers were coming down along this route .PERIOD 
and they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them ,COMMA which is really not much ,COMMA because camp three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle .PERIOD 
you can barely stand outside the tent .PERIOD 
it's really cold ;SEMICOLON it's <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids .PERIOD 
the ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated ,COMMA i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain .PERIOD 
it's so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes .PERIOD 
it was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there .PERIOD 
while i was taking care of them ,COMMA we got more news about rob hall .PERIOD 
there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him .PERIOD 
he called in to say that he was alone now .PERIOD 
apparently ,COMMA doug had died higher up on the mountain .PERIOD 
but rob was now too weak to come down himself ,COMMA and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude ,COMMA he was just beyond rescue and he knew it .PERIOD 
at that point ,COMMA he asked to be paged into his wife .PERIOD 
he was carrying a radio .PERIOD 
they picked the name for their baby .PERIOD 
rob then signed off ,COMMA and that was the last we ever heard of him .PERIOD 
i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at <NUM> feet ,COMMA which was an impossibility .PERIOD 
so what we did was ,COMMA we got the victims down to <NUM> feet ,COMMA where it was easier for me to treat them .PERIOD 
this was my medical kit .PERIOD 
this is what i carried up the mountain .PERIOD 
i had more supplies lower down ,COMMA which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp .PERIOD 
and this was scene at the lower camp .PERIOD 
the survivors came in one by one .PERIOD 
some of them were hypothermic ,COMMA some of them were frostbitten ,COMMA some were both .PERIOD 
this is some severe frostbite on the feet ,COMMA severe frostbite on the nose .PERIOD 
this climber was snow blind .PERIOD 
out of nowhere ,COMMA beck weathers ,COMMA who we had already been told was dead ,COMMA stumbled into the tent ,COMMA just like a mummy ,COMMA he walked into the tent .PERIOD 
i expected him to be incoherent ,COMMA but ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he walked into the tent and said to me ,COMMA hi ,COMMA ken .PERIOD where should i sit ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then he said ,COMMA do you accept my health insurance ?QUESTIONMARK 
he really said that .PERIOD 
so he was completely lucid ,COMMA but he was very severely frostbitten .PERIOD 
you can see his hand is completely white ;SEMICOLON his face ,COMMA his nose ,COMMA is burned .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA it turns white ,COMMA and then when it's completed necrosis ,COMMA it turns black ,COMMA and then it falls off .PERIOD 
it's the last stage ,COMMA just like a scar .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as i was taking care of beck ,COMMA he related what had been going on up there .PERIOD 
he said he had gotten lost in the storm ,COMMA collapsed in the snow ,COMMA and just laid there ,COMMA unable to move .PERIOD 
some climbers had come by and looked at him ,COMMA and he heard them say ,COMMA he's dead .PERIOD 
he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings ,COMMA but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive .PERIOD 
so the climbers passed him by ,COMMA and beck lay there for a day ,COMMA a night and another day ,COMMA in the snow .PERIOD 
and then he said to himself ,COMMA i don't want to die .PERIOD 
i have a family to come back to .PERIOD 
and the thoughts of his family ,COMMA his kids and his wife ,COMMA generated enough energy ,COMMA enough motivation in him ,COMMA so that he actually got up .PERIOD 
after laying in the snow that long a time ,COMMA he got up and found his way back to the camp .PERIOD 
and beck told me that story very quietly ,COMMA but i was absolutely stunned by it .PERIOD 
i couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up .PERIOD 
he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia .PERIOD 
and i can only try to speculate on how he did it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what if we had beck hooked up to a spect scan ,COMMA something that could actually measure brain function ?QUESTIONMARK 
just very simply ,COMMA the three parts of the brain :COLON the frontal lobe ,COMMA where you focus your attention and concentration ;SEMICOLON you have the temporal lobe ,COMMA where you form images and keep memories ;SEMICOLON and the posterior part of your brain ,COMMA which contains the cerebellum ,COMMA which controls motion ;SEMICOLON and the brain stem ,COMMA where you have your basic maintenance functions ,COMMA like heartbeat and respiration .PERIOD 
so let's take a cut through the brain here ,COMMA and imagine that beck was hooked up to a spect scan .PERIOD 
this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain .PERIOD 
so you have the prefrontal cortex here ,COMMA lighting up in red .PERIOD 
this is a pretty evenly distributed scan .PERIOD 
you have the middle area ,COMMA where the temporal lobe might be ,COMMA in here ,COMMA and the posterior portion ,COMMA where the maintenance functions are in the back .PERIOD 
this is a roughly normal scan ,COMMA showing equal distribution of energy .PERIOD 
this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger .PERIOD 
he's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble .PERIOD 
these parts of the brain are quieting down .PERIOD 
he's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point ,COMMA and he's working pretty hard .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA but he's losing ground here .PERIOD 
he's running out of energy .PERIOD 
he's collapsed in the snow here .PERIOD everything is quiet ,COMMA there's very little red anywhere .PERIOD 
beck is powering down .PERIOD 
he's dying .PERIOD 
you go on to the next scan ,COMMA but ,COMMA in beck's case ,COMMA you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again .PERIOD 
he's beginning to think about his family .PERIOD 
he's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up .PERIOD 
he's developing energy in this area through thought .PERIOD 
and this is how he's going to turn thought back into action .PERIOD 
this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus .PERIOD 
it's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists .PERIOD 
this is where people make decisions ,COMMA where they develop willpower .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain ,COMMA where he's got images of his family ,COMMA into this area ,COMMA which is powering his will .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor .PERIOD 
he's going to develop enough energy in that area -- after a day ,COMMA a night and a day -- to actually motivate himself to get up .PERIOD 
and you can see here ,COMMA he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe .PERIOD 
he's beginning to focus ,COMMA he can concentrate now .PERIOD 
so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain ,COMMA and it's getting quieter down here ,COMMA but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas .PERIOD 
this is the posterior part ,COMMA where his muscles are going to be moving ,COMMA and he's going to be pacing himself .PERIOD 
his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed .PERIOD 
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic .PERIOD 
so here i am taking care of beck at <NUM> feet ,COMMA and i felt what i was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself .PERIOD 
it just shows you what the power of the mind can do .PERIOD 
he was critically ill ,COMMA there were other critically ill patients ;SEMICOLON luckily ,COMMA we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .PERIOD 
it was able to land on the ice ,COMMA take away beck and the other survivors ,COMMA one by one ,COMMA and get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp .PERIOD 
this is a scene at base camp ,COMMA at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost .PERIOD 
and we had a memorial service there a few days later .PERIOD 
these are serphas lighting juniper branches .PERIOD 
they believe juniper smoke is holy .PERIOD 
and the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit ,COMMA turning to the mountain ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to talk to them directly .PERIOD 
there were five climbers lost here .PERIOD 
this was scott fischer ,COMMA rob hall ,COMMA andy harris ,COMMA doug hansen and yasuko namba .PERIOD 
and one more climber should have died that day ,COMMA but didn't ,COMMA and that's beck weathers .PERIOD 
he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower ,COMMA he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself .PERIOD 
these are tibetan prayer flags .PERIOD 
these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags ,COMMA the message will be carried up to the gods ,COMMA and that year ,COMMA beck's message was answered .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
three years ago ,COMMA i got a phone call ,COMMA based on an earlier film i had made ,COMMA with an offer to embed the new hampshire national guard .PERIOD 
my idea -- and literally ,COMMA i woke up in the middle of the night ,COMMA and we've all have those moments .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you go to sleep -- i was excited ,COMMA with this phone call .PERIOD 
i was thinking ,COMMA i just finished making another film about world war ii vets ,COMMA and i realized i'd gotten to know their stories ,COMMA and i realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded .PERIOD 
so i went to bed that night pretty excited .PERIOD 
not sure of all the details ,COMMA but excited .PERIOD 
it wasn't at four in the morning ,COMMA but it was closer to midnight .PERIOD 
woke straight up .PERIOD wide-awake as could be .PERIOD 
and i had this idea :COLON what if i could ,COMMA in effect ,COMMA virtually embed ,COMMA and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers ?QUESTIONMARK 
to tell the story from the inside out ,COMMA versus the outside in ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i called back major heilshorn ,COMMA who's the public affairs officer of the new hampshire national guard .PERIOD 
and he knew me ,COMMA so i was like ,COMMA greg ?QUESTIONMARK 
he's like ,COMMA yes ,COMMA deborah ?QUESTIONMARK 
told him my idea ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA he is one of the bravest men in the world ,COMMA as is general blair ,COMMA who ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA gave me permission to try this experiment .PERIOD 
within <NUM> days ,COMMA i was down at fort dix .PERIOD 
he gave me my pick of units .PERIOD 
i picked one unit -- charlie company ,COMMA third of the 172nd ,COMMA they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA they're infantry .PERIOD 
number two ,COMMA they were going to be based at lsa anaconda ,COMMA so i knew they would have internet access .PERIOD 
the caveat for my access was i had to get the soldiers to volunteer .PERIOD 
this was a big thing that i think when major h told me ,COMMA i wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean .PERIOD 
so what that meant was ,COMMA when i went down to fort dix ,COMMA i had to hop out in front of <NUM> guys and tell them of my vision .PERIOD 
you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got .PERIOD 
the opening one was ,COMMA what the fuck do you know about the national guard ?QUESTIONMARK 
i started with the <NUM> massachusetts bay colony pequot indian wars .PERIOD 
gave them about a nine minute response ,COMMA and there we went .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'd like to show the clip of the film .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i want to show the trailer ,COMMA and then i'm going to take apart one scene in detail .PERIOD 
stephen pink :COLON this is sergeant stephen pink .PERIOD 
michael moriarty :COLON specialist michael moriarty .PERIOD 
zack bazzi :COLON do i really want to go ?QUESTIONMARK probably not .PERIOD 
soldier :COLON we're not supposed to talk to the media .PERIOD

i hope .PERIOD 
one of the things i'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about .PERIOD 
and i'd like to relate an experience i had here at ted .PERIOD 
i don't know how many of you might imagine it ,COMMA but there's actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq .PERIOD 
paul ?QUESTIONMARK come on ,COMMA stand up .PERIOD 
this is paul anthony .PERIOD 
he served -- -- with the marines ,COMMA and i want to tell you a little ,COMMA brief story .PERIOD 
right ?QUESTIONMARK and we started talking .PERIOD 
people will see my tag ,COMMA and they'll see the war tapes ,COMMA and then we'll start talking about war .PERIOD 
we got in a conversation with some other people in the class ,COMMA and it went on and on .PERIOD 
and really -- because maybe we're going to disagree .PERIOD 
maybe it's going to get uncomfortable .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA paul was talking ,COMMA and he then turned to constance and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here ,COMMA because i know she has my back .PERIOD 
and i want to say ,COMMA i was nervous .PERIOD 
because i'm used to doing q&ampas .PERIOD 
i really related to what james was saying yesterday ,COMMA because i'm behind the camera .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i can answer questions about my movie ,COMMA but for me to come up and talk for <NUM> minutes is a really long time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i wanted to say ,COMMA paul ,COMMA i'm happy you're here ,COMMA because i know you have my back .PERIOD 
this film was not about the internet ,COMMA but it could not have been made without it .PERIOD 
the guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from iraq to me .PERIOD 
in the meantime ,COMMA the soldiers -- we would email and im .PERIOD 
i didn't save all of them ,COMMA because i didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that i would want to keep track of .PERIOD 
but there were <NUM> emails and ims and text messages that i was able to save .PERIOD 
the reason i quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it .PERIOD 
so i wanted to show you a clip ,COMMA and then i was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together .PERIOD 
if we could roll the clip .PERIOD 
today is sport .PERIOD [unclear] radio :COLON [unclear] christian soldiers .PERIOD 
we like to give these insurgents a fair chance .PERIOD

we don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down .PERIOD 
it's not true .PERIOD very unsafe .PERIOD 
whoa .PERIOD 
soldier :COLON right there .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA let's get over to that site .PERIOD

probably <NUM> dead ,COMMA at least <NUM> or <NUM> wounded iraqis .PERIOD 
it just looked like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA someone had thrown a quarter through a guy ,COMMA and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds .PERIOD 
everything was cauterized ,COMMA and it was just like there was a void going through the body .PERIOD 
this is the scene north .PERIOD 
they just removed a burnt body ,COMMA or half a body from here .PERIOD 
i don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA you walk ,COMMA and you hear the pieces of skin .PERIOD 
and that's it ,COMMA that's all that's left .PERIOD 
i remember giving three ivs ,COMMA bandaging several wounded .PERIOD 
soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall ,COMMA shaking and screaming .PERIOD 
medics who were terrified and couldn't perform .PERIOD 
i later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji .PERIOD 
they can work on the post for pennies ,COMMA but can't die there .PERIOD 
they've got to die outside .PERIOD 
if one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment ,COMMA i would've slit his throat right there .PERIOD 
<NUM> hours ,COMMA and it's just our squad going through today's events in our heads ,COMMA whether we want to or not .PERIOD 
news anchor :COLON more violence in iraq .PERIOD 
twin suicide car bombings killed eight iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of baghdad .PERIOD 
we made the news .PERIOD 
i feel exploited and proud at the same time .PERIOD 
i've lost all faith in the media -- a hapless joke i would much rather laugh at than become a part of .PERIOD 
i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass .PERIOD 
i'll do that ,COMMA then i'm gonna jerk off .PERIOD 
because these pages smell like linds ,COMMA and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow .PERIOD 
another mission at <NUM> .PERIOD 
now -- -- thanks .PERIOD 
when i said earlier ,COMMA to try and tell a story from the inside out ,COMMA versus the outside in -- part of what chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding .PERIOD 
it's a new way of trying to make a documentary .PERIOD 
when i met the guys ,COMMA and <NUM> of them agreed to take cameras -- in total ,COMMA <NUM> ended up filming .PERIOD 
there are three featured in the film .PERIOD 
the way i learned about taji was steve pink sent me an email ,COMMA and in it ,COMMA attached a photo of that burned body out at the car .PERIOD 
and the tone from the email was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it had been a very bad day ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD 
and i saw in my im window that mike moriarty was at the base .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i pinged mike and i said ,COMMA mike ,COMMA can you please go get that interview with pink ?QUESTIONMARK 
because the thing that very often is missing is ,COMMA in the military what they call hot wash .PERIOD 
it's that immediate interview after something immediately happens ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and if you let time go by ,COMMA it kind of softens and smooths the edges .PERIOD 
and for me ,COMMA i really wanted that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in order to get the intimacy ,COMMA to share that experience with you ,COMMA the guys -- the two most popular mounts -- there was a camera on the turret ,COMMA the gun turret ,COMMA and then on the dashboard of the humvee .PERIOD 
most of the humvees ,COMMA we ended up mounting two cameras in them .PERIOD 
so you get to experience that in real time ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
the interview that you see is the one that mike went and did within <NUM> hours of that episode happening .PERIOD 
steve pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home .PERIOD 
i knew about that journal ,COMMA but it was very ,COMMA very private .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA you earn someone's trust ,COMMA especially in doc filmmaking ,COMMA through your relationship .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it wasn't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the news footage i put in there to try to show -- you know ,COMMA i think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have .PERIOD 
but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times ,COMMA american soldiers saying ,COMMA why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA this is a perfect example .PERIOD 
pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire .PERIOD 
they didn't have to go outside the wire .PERIOD 
there were not americans hurt out there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when you may hear soldiers complaining ,COMMA that's what they're talking about ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging .PERIOD 
and when i talk about that polarity i get at so many different q&ampas ,COMMA and people are really opinionated .PERIOD 
but it seems like people don't want to hear so much ,COMMA or listen ,COMMA or try to have an exchange .PERIOD 
and i'm as fiery as the next person ,COMMA but i really think -- you know ,COMMA different speakers have talked about their concern for the world ,COMMA and my concern is that we have to have these conversations .PERIOD 
and we have to be able to go into scary places where we may ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we think we know .PERIOD 
but we just have to leave that little bit of openness ,COMMA to know .PERIOD 
there's such a disconnect .PERIOD 
i'll share one story .PERIOD 
and at screenings ,COMMA inevitably -- you know ,COMMA as i'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff -- usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions .PERIOD 
and usually ,COMMA the first questions are ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what kind of cameras did you use ?QUESTIONMARK 
or you know ,COMMA these things .PERIOD 
but there's always a few guys ,COMMA almost always ,COMMA who are the last ones .PERIOD 
and i've learned over time that those are always the soldiers .PERIOD 
and they wait until pretty much everybody's gone .PERIOD 
and for me ,COMMA one of the most profound stories someone shared with me ,COMMA that then became my story ,COMMA was -- for those of you who haven't seen the film ,COMMA and it's not a spoiler -- it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents ,COMMA where people get in front of humvees and they get killed .PERIOD 
in this film ,COMMA there is a scene where an iraqi woman is killed .PERIOD 
a soldier came up to me and stood ,COMMA you know really ,COMMA pretty close ,COMMA a foot away from me .PERIOD 
he's a big guy .PERIOD 
and he wasn't going to blink .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA my gunner was throwing candy .PERIOD 
and i knew what he was going to say .PERIOD 
the gunner was throwing candy .PERIOD 
they used to throw candy to the kids .PERIOD 
kids got too close ,COMMA very often .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA i killed a child .PERIOD 
and i'm a father .PERIOD i have children .PERIOD 
i haven't been able to tell my wife .PERIOD 
i'm afraid she's going to think i'm a monster .PERIOD 
i hugged him ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's going to be ok .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA i'm going to bring her to see your film .PERIOD 
and then i'm going to tell her .PERIOD 
you can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on .PERIOD 
and often ,COMMA i'll hear people say ,COMMA who maybe know that i did this film ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm against the war ,COMMA but i support the soldiers .PERIOD 
and i've started to ask them ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's nice .PERIOD what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
are you volunteering at a va ?QUESTIONMARK 
you go and see anybody ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you ,COMMA if you find out your neighbor's been ,COMMA do you spend some time ?QUESTIONMARK 
not necessarily ask questions ,COMMA but see if they want to talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA like dean kamen's working on that amazing thing ,COMMA but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers .PERIOD 
i think ,COMMA i challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms ,COMMA when we say we support someone ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
are you a friend to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i would just say it's my hope ,COMMA and i would ask you guys to please ,COMMA you know ,COMMA reach out a hand .PERIOD 
and really do give them a hug .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA this is about the evils of science ,COMMA so i think it’s perfect .PERIOD 
♫ my oh my ,COMMA walking by ,COMMA who’s the apple of my eye ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ why ,COMMA it's my very own clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ oh ,COMMA if i should stroll the hood ,COMMA who knew i could look so good ♫ ♫ just talking on the phone to clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ we are pals ,COMMA it's cool ,COMMA 'cause we're not lonely ,COMMA ♫ ♫ shallow gene pool is nothing to my only clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ me and you ,COMMA hustling through ,COMMA holding on through thick and thin ,COMMA ♫ ♫ just day by day ,COMMA our dna ,COMMA so the olson twins got nothing on us .PERIOD ♫ ♫ we'll survive ,COMMA side by side .PERIOD mother nature ,COMMA don’t you call her phony ,COMMA she’s my clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ was wealthy ,COMMA but not healthy ,COMMA had no one to dwell with me ,COMMA ♫ ♫ so look who i got born -- clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ far from broke ,COMMA bored ,COMMA rich folk ,COMMA we don't need no natural yolk -- ♫ ♫ our babies come full-formed ,COMMA clonie .PERIOD ♫ ♫ we'll be huggable ,COMMA get a publicist ♫ ♫ and show them ,COMMA be the most lovable thing since fucking eminem .PERIOD ♫ ♫ oh my friend ,COMMA multiply ,COMMA we’re a franchise ,COMMA like walt disney or hannibal lecter .PERIOD ♫ ♫ we can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old phil spector .PERIOD ♫ ♫ we’ll survive side by side ,COMMA should have signed with verve instead of sony .PERIOD ♫ ♫ you’re my clonie .PERIOD ♫ oh clonie ,COMMA how i love you .PERIOD

what's happening to the climate ?QUESTIONMARK 
it is unbelievably bad .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA that famous view now of the arctic ,COMMA which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years .PERIOD very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very scary .PERIOD 
so we all look at what we can do .PERIOD 
and when you look at the worldwide sources of co2 ,COMMA <NUM> percent are tied to buildings .PERIOD 
only nine percent is passenger cars ,COMMA interestingly enough .PERIOD 
so we ran off to a sushi bar .PERIOD 
and at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea .PERIOD 
and we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates <NUM> billion pounds of co2 a year .PERIOD 
so it was a big idea .PERIOD we wanted to reduce that by <NUM> percent ,COMMA which is exactly what we've done .PERIOD 
we started r&ampd in <NUM> .PERIOD 
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .PERIOD 
there is the inside of our lab .PERIOD we haven't shown this before .PERIOD 
but our people had to do some <NUM> different mixes to get this right ,COMMA to hit our targets .PERIOD 
so then we went forward and built our production line in china .PERIOD 
we don't build this production equipment any longer in the us ,COMMA unfortunately .PERIOD 
we did the line install over the summer .PERIOD 
we started right there ,COMMA with absolutely nothing .PERIOD 
you're seeing for the first time ,COMMA a brand new drywall production line ,COMMA not made using gypsum at all .PERIOD 
we got our first panel out on december third .PERIOD 
that is the slurry being poured onto paper ,COMMA basically .PERIOD that's the line running .PERIOD 
the exciting thing is ,COMMA look at the faces of the people .PERIOD 
these are people who worked this project for two to three years .PERIOD 
and they are so excited .PERIOD that's the first board off the line .PERIOD 
our vice president of operation kissing the board .PERIOD obviously very ,COMMA very excited .PERIOD 
but this has a huge ,COMMA huge impact on the environment .PERIOD 
we signed the first panel just a few weeks after that ,COMMA had a great signing ceremony ,COMMA leading to people hopefully using these products across the world .PERIOD 
and we've got cradle-to-cradle gold on this thing .PERIOD 
we happened to win ,COMMA just recently ,COMMA the green product of the year for the re-invention of drywall ,COMMA from popular science .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
so here is what we learned :COLON <NUM> gallons of gas equivalent to build one house .PERIOD 
you probably had no idea .PERIOD it's like driving around the world six times .PERIOD 
look around the room :COLON chairs ,COMMA wood ,COMMA everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem .PERIOD 
don't listen to the people who say you can't do this ,COMMA because anyone can .PERIOD 
and these job losses ,COMMA we can fix them with green-collar jobs .PERIOD 
we've got four plants .PERIOD we're building this stuff around the country .PERIOD 
we're going as fast as we can .PERIOD 
two and a half million cars worth of gypsum ,COMMA you know ,COMMA co2 generated .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so what will you do ?QUESTIONMARK i'll tell you what i did and why i did it .PERIOD and i know my time's up .PERIOD 
those are my kids ,COMMA natalie and david .PERIOD 
when they have their kids ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA they'd better look back at grandpa and say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you gave it a good shot .PERIOD you did the best you could with the team that you had .PERIOD 
so my hope is that when you leave ted ,COMMA you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it .PERIOD 
and if you don't know how ,COMMA please find me -- i will help you .PERIOD 
last but not least ,COMMA bill gates ,COMMA i know you invented windows .PERIOD 
wait till you see ,COMMA maybe next year ,COMMA what kind of windows we've invented .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
over the last <NUM> years -- one ,COMMA three ,COMMA <NUM> years -- i've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea ,COMMA this concept ,COMMA noninvasive surgery ,COMMA from the research lab to routine clinical use .PERIOD 
and this is what i'll tell you about .PERIOD 
<NUM> years -- for some of you ,COMMA you can empathize with that number .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA today ,COMMA on this date ,COMMA it's like a second bar mitzvah experience .PERIOD 
so this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies .PERIOD 
one is the focused ultrasound ,COMMA and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .PERIOD 
it is made out of silicon .PERIOD 
so you see ,COMMA it's all intact ,COMMA completely transparent .PERIOD 
i'll take you now to the acoustic lab .PERIOD 
you see the phantom within the aquarium .PERIOD 
on the right-hand side ,COMMA you see an ultrasonic transducer .PERIOD 
so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA when you hear the click ,COMMA this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so everything around it is whole and intact .PERIOD 
it's just a lesion formed inside .PERIOD 
so think about ,COMMA this is in your brain .PERIOD 
we can do it without harming any tissue .PERIOD 
so this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the first kosher hippocratic surgical system .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound ,COMMA the force of ultrasound .PERIOD 
you know all about imaging ,COMMA right ,COMMA ultrasound imaging .PERIOD 
and you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .PERIOD 
but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between ,COMMA because it's a mechanical force .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA it's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses .PERIOD 
so you can change the intensity ,COMMA the frequency ,COMMA the duration ,COMMA the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer .PERIOD 
and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing ,COMMA physically focusing .PERIOD 
so this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all .PERIOD 
when i was born ,COMMA this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the fry brothers and lars leksell ,COMMA who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife .PERIOD 
he failed ,COMMA so he then invented the gammaknife .PERIOD 
and there was something fundamental that they were missing .PERIOD 
it wasn't until the invention of the mr and really the integration of mr with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback -- both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive ,COMMA closed-loop surgical procedure .PERIOD 
so this is how it looks ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the operating room of the future today .PERIOD 
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .PERIOD 
and i will give you several examples .PERIOD 
so the first one is in the brain .PERIOD 
one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders ,COMMA like parkinson's or essential tremor .PERIOD 
what is typical to those conditions ,COMMA to essential tremor for example ,COMMA is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you ,COMMA or write legibly so people can understand it ,COMMA and be really independent in your life without the help of others .PERIOD 
so i'd like you to meet john .PERIOD 
john is a retired professor of history from virginia .PERIOD 
so he suffered from essential tremor for many years .PERIOD 
and medication didn't help him anymore .PERIOD 
and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .PERIOD 
and about four or five months ago ,COMMA he underwent an experimental procedure .PERIOD 
and this is his handwriting .PERIOD 
on june 20th ,COMMA if you can read it ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i'll take you through [what] a typical procedure like that looks like ,COMMA [what] noninvasive surgery looks like .PERIOD 
so we put the patient on the mr table .PERIOD 
and the physician will then take a regular mr scan .PERIOD 
and the objective of that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't have a pointer here ,COMMA but you see the green ,COMMA sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is the sort of general area of the treatment .PERIOD 
it's a safety boundary around the target .PERIOD 
so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on ,COMMA he selects basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is -- and he presses this blue button called sonicate .PERIOD 
we call this instance of injecting the energy ,COMMA we call it sonication .PERIOD 
the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .PERIOD 
this is the only device he needs in this treatment .PERIOD 
so he presses sonicate ,COMMA and this is what happens .PERIOD 
you see the transducer ,COMMA the light blue .PERIOD 
there's water in between the skull and the transducer .PERIOD 
and it does this burst of energy .PERIOD 
it elevates the temperature .PERIOD 
we first need to verify that we are on target .PERIOD 
so the first sonication is at lower energy .PERIOD 
and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively .PERIOD 
this is really a unique capability of the mr .PERIOD 
it is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging .PERIOD 
and you can see the points there on the graph .PERIOD 
the temperature was raised to <NUM> degrees c temporarily .PERIOD 
this doesn't cause any damage .PERIOD 
but the point is we are right on target .PERIOD 
and you see the temperature rises to like <NUM> to <NUM> degrees c .PERIOD 
if you do it for more than a second ,COMMA it's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells .PERIOD 
this is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .PERIOD 
this is an immediate relief .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
john is one of [about] a dozen very heroic ,COMMA courageous people who volunteered for the study .PERIOD 
and this is a quote from john after he wrote it .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA miraculous .PERIOD 
and his wife said ,COMMA this is the happiest moment of my life .PERIOD 
and you wonder why .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA one of the messages i like to carry over is ,COMMA what about defending quality of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA those people lose their independence .PERIOD 
they are dependent on others .PERIOD 
and john today is fully independent .PERIOD 
he returned to a normal life routine .PERIOD 
and he also plays golf ,COMMA like you do in virginia when you are retired .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so you can see here the spot .PERIOD 
it's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .PERIOD 
there's no damage outside .PERIOD 
he suffers from no neurodeficit .PERIOD 
there's no recovery needed ,COMMA no nothing .PERIOD 
he's back to his normal life .PERIOD 
let's move now to a more painful subject .PERIOD 
pain is something that can make your life miserable .PERIOD 
and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain ,COMMA lower-back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases ,COMMA when the metastases get to your bones ,COMMA sometimes they are very painful .PERIOD 
all those i've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain ,COMMA again ,COMMA very fast .PERIOD 
and i would like to tell you about pj .PERIOD 
he's a <NUM> year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should i say it ?QUESTIONMARK -- it's called pain in the butt .PERIOD 
he had metastases in his right buttock ,COMMA and he couldn't sit even with medication .PERIOD 
he had to forgo all the farm activities .PERIOD 
he was treated with radiation therapy ,COMMA state-of-the-art radiation therapy ,COMMA but it didn't help .PERIOD 
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide ,COMMA also in the us .PERIOD 
and his wife actually took him .PERIOD 
he had to sit on a cushion ,COMMA stand still ,COMMA not move ,COMMA because it was very painful .PERIOD 
he took the treatment ,COMMA and on the way back ,COMMA he drove the truck by himself .PERIOD 
and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens .PERIOD 
he returned again to his daily routine on the farm .PERIOD 
he rides his tractor .PERIOD 
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .PERIOD 
and he has been very happy .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA you ask me ,COMMA but what about war ,COMMA the war on cancer ?QUESTIONMARK 
show us some primary cancer .PERIOD 
what can be done there ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i have good news and bad news .PERIOD 
the good news :COLON there's a lot that can be done .PERIOD 
and it has been shown actually outside of the us .PERIOD 
and doing that in the us .PERIOD 
is very painful .PERIOD 
so the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .PERIOD 
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .PERIOD 
but i have a message for the men here .PERIOD 
we heard here yesterday quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer .PERIOD 
there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr ,COMMA because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland ,COMMA and by that ,COMMA avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal ,COMMA very lethal actually -- pancreas ,COMMA liver ,COMMA kidney .PERIOD 
the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments ,COMMA the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time .PERIOD 
and this will take time .PERIOD 
this will take two years .PERIOD 
but i have now a message to the ladies .PERIOD 
and this is ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA the fda has approved mr-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .PERIOD 
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods ,COMMA abdominal pressure ,COMMA back pain ,COMMA frequent urination .PERIOD 
and sometimes ,COMMA they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid .PERIOD 
this is frances .PERIOD 
she was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .PERIOD 
this is a big fibroid .PERIOD 
she was offered a hysterectomy ,COMMA but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .PERIOD 
so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and in <NUM> ,COMMA she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby .PERIOD 
so new life was born .PERIOD 
so in conclusion ,COMMA i'd like to leave you with actually four messages .PERIOD 
one is ,COMMA think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery ,COMMA and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large -- and i think also from their physicians ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
and the other thing i would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment .PERIOD 
in all our treatments ,COMMA the patient holds a stop sonication button .PERIOD 
he can stop the surgery at any moment .PERIOD 
and with that note ,COMMA i would like to thank you for listening .PERIOD 
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .PERIOD 
she's an italian fashion designer .PERIOD 
she goes to this vintage store in paris with a friend of hers .PERIOD 
she's rooting around ,COMMA she finds this one jacket by balenciaga -- she loves it .PERIOD 
she's turning it inside out .PERIOD 
she's looking at the seams .PERIOD she's looking at the construction .PERIOD 
her friend says ,COMMA buy it already .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA i'll buy it ,COMMA but i'm also going to replicate it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the academics in this audience may think ,COMMA well ,COMMA that sounds like plagiarism .PERIOD 
but to a fashionista ,COMMA what it really is is a sign of prada's genius :COLON that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that doesn't need to be changed by one iota ,COMMA and to be current and to be now .PERIOD 
you might also be asking whether it's possible that this is illegal for her to do this .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it turns out that it's actually not illegal .PERIOD 
they have trademark protection ,COMMA but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of .PERIOD 
all they have ,COMMA really ,COMMA is trademark protection ,COMMA and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .PERIOD 
the only thing that they can't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel .PERIOD 
that's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products .PERIOD 
but if you go to santee alley ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
canal street ,COMMA i know .PERIOD 
and sometimes these are fun ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
they didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing .PERIOD 
and then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because joe blow owns it .PERIOD 
but too utilitarian ?QUESTIONMARK i mean is that the way you think of fashion ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is vivienne westwood .PERIOD no !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we think of it as maybe too silly ,COMMA too unnecessary .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection -- which is that without ownership ,COMMA there is no incentive to innovate -- might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry .PERIOD 
what i'm going to argue today is that because there's no copyright protection in the fashion industry ,COMMA fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design ,COMMA things to cover our naked bodies ,COMMA into something that we consider art .PERIOD 
because there's no copyright protection in this industry ,COMMA there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity .PERIOD 
unlike their creative brothers and sisters ,COMMA who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians ,COMMA fashion designers can sample from all their peers' designs .PERIOD 
they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design .PERIOD 
they're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA i suspect ,COMMA they were influenced by the costumes in avatar .PERIOD 
maybe just a little .PERIOD 
can't copyright a costume either .PERIOD 
this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks ,COMMA and this dress is actually made of aluminum .PERIOD 
i've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying ,COMMA which is really what it is ,COMMA is the establishment of trends .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's because it's legal for people to copy one another .PERIOD 
some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear ,COMMA but if you talk to any designer at any level ,COMMA including these high-end designers ,COMMA they always say their main inspiration comes from the street :COLON where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks .PERIOD 
and that's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration ,COMMA so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .PERIOD 
they are notorious for knocking off high-end designs and selling them at very low prices .PERIOD 
and they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits ,COMMA but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers .PERIOD 
the courts have said over and over again ,COMMA you don't need any more intellectual property protection .PERIOD 
when you look at copies like this ,COMMA you wonder :COLON how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you can get it for <NUM> bucks ,COMMA why pay a thousand ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA that's one reason we had a conference here at usc a few years ago .PERIOD 
we invited tom ford to come -- the conference was called ,COMMA ready to share :COLON fashion and the ownership of creativity -- and we asked him exactly this question .PERIOD 
here's what he had to say .PERIOD 
he had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at gucci ,COMMA in case you didn't know .PERIOD 
tom ford :COLON and we found after much research that -- actually not much research ,COMMA quite simple research -- that the counterfeit customer was not our customer .PERIOD 
the people on santee alley are not the ones who shop at gucci .PERIOD 
this is a very different demographic .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design ,COMMA at least in terms of the materials ;SEMICOLON they're always made of cheaper materials .PERIOD 
but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects ,COMMA can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .PERIOD 
there's lots of virtues of copying .PERIOD 
one that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before ,COMMA and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
and this is a good thing .PERIOD we need lots of options .PERIOD 
fashion ,COMMA whether you like it or not ,COMMA helps you project who you are to the world .PERIOD 
because of fast fashion ,COMMA global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is good news to trendsetters ;SEMICOLON they want trends to be set so that they can move product .PERIOD 
for fashionistas ,COMMA they want to stay ahead of the curve .PERIOD 
they don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .PERIOD 
i tell you ,COMMA there is no rest for the fashionable .PERIOD 
every season ,COMMA these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA is very good for the bottom line .PERIOD 
now of course ,COMMA there's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process .PERIOD 
and stuart weitzman is a very successful shoe designer .PERIOD 
he has complained a lot about people copying him ,COMMA but in one interview i read ,COMMA he said it has really forced him to up his game .PERIOD 
he had to come up with new ideas ,COMMA new things that would be hard to copy .PERIOD 
he came up with this bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ;SEMICOLON if you make it from some sort of cheaper material ,COMMA it'll actually crack in two .PERIOD 
it forced him to be a little more innovative .PERIOD 
and that actually reminded me of jazz great ,COMMA charlie parker .PERIOD 
i don't know if you've heard this anecdote ,COMMA but i have .PERIOD 
he said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound .PERIOD 
he wanted to make it too difficult to copy ,COMMA and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time .PERIOD 
they're trying to put together a signature look ,COMMA an aesthetic that reflects who they are .PERIOD 
when people knock it off ,COMMA everybody knows because they've put that look out on the runway ,COMMA and it's a coherent aesthetic .PERIOD 
i love these gallianos .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA we'll move on .PERIOD 
this is not unlike the world of comedy .PERIOD 
i don't know if you know that jokes also can't be copyright protected .PERIOD 
so when one-liners were really popular ,COMMA everybody stole them from one another .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA we have a different kind of comic .PERIOD 
they develop a persona ,COMMA a signature style ,COMMA much like fashion designers .PERIOD 
and their jokes ,COMMA much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer ,COMMA really only work within that aesthetic .PERIOD 
if somebody steals a joke from larry david ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA it's not as funny .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they've learned how to copy themselves .PERIOD 
they knock themselves off .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA some fashion designers will say ,COMMA it's only in the united states that we don't have any respect .PERIOD 
in other countries there is protection for our artful designs .PERIOD 
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world ,COMMA it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual .PERIOD 
in japan ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA which i think is the third largest market ,COMMA they have a design law ;SEMICOLON it protects apparel ,COMMA but the novelty standard is so high ,COMMA you have to prove that your garment has never existed before ,COMMA it's totally unique .PERIOD 
and that's sort of like the novelty standard for a us .PERIOD patent ,COMMA which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states .PERIOD 
in the european union ,COMMA they went in the other direction .PERIOD 
but even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there ,COMMA they don't register their garments ,COMMA generally ,COMMA and there's not a lot of litigation .PERIOD 
it turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low .PERIOD 
a person can come in and take somebody else's gown ,COMMA cut off three inches from the bottom ,COMMA go to the eu .PERIOD and register it as a new ,COMMA original design .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that does not stop the knock-off artists .PERIOD 
if you look at the registry ,COMMA actually ,COMMA a lot of the registered things in the eu .PERIOD 
are nike t-shirts that are almost identical to one another .PERIOD 
but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg .PERIOD 
she is the head of the council of fashion designers of america ,COMMA and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs .PERIOD 
the retailers have kind of quashed this notion though .PERIOD 
i don't think the legislation is going anywhere ,COMMA because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that's just part of a global trend .PERIOD 
who owns a look ?QUESTIONMARK 
it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time ,COMMA and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection .PERIOD 
there's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection ,COMMA including the food industry .PERIOD 
you cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions ,COMMA it's fact ,COMMA and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish .PERIOD 
same with automobiles .PERIOD 
it doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look ,COMMA you cannot copyright the sculptural design .PERIOD 
it's a utilitarian article ,COMMA that's why .PERIOD 
same with furniture ,COMMA it's too utilitarian .PERIOD 
magic tricks ,COMMA i think they're instructions ,COMMA sort of like recipes :COLON no copyright protection .PERIOD 
hairdos ,COMMA no copyright protection .PERIOD 
open source software ,COMMA these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection .PERIOD 
they thought it'd be more innovative without it .PERIOD 
it's really hard to get copyright for databases .PERIOD 
tattoo artists ,COMMA they don't want it ;SEMICOLON it's not cool .PERIOD 
they share their designs .PERIOD 
jokes ,COMMA no copyright protection .PERIOD 
and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you ,COMMA but these are the gross sales for low ip .PERIOD industries ,COMMA industries with very little copyright protection ,COMMA and there's the gross sales of films and books .PERIOD 
it ain't pretty .PERIOD 
so you talk to people in the fashion industry and they're like ,COMMA shhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
don't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other's designs .PERIOD 
it's embarrassing .PERIOD 
but you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it's revolutionary ,COMMA and it's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this .PERIOD 
because right now ,COMMA those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it's as if they don't have any protection ,COMMA and they don't know what to do .PERIOD 
when i found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that didn't have copyright protection ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA what exactly is the underlying logic ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want a picture .PERIOD and the lawyers do not provide a picture ,COMMA so i made one .PERIOD 
these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law .PERIOD 
first :COLON is something an artistic object ?QUESTIONMARK 
then it deserves protection .PERIOD 
is it a utilitarian object ?QUESTIONMARK 
then no ,COMMA it does not deserve protection .PERIOD 
this is a difficult ,COMMA unstable binary .PERIOD 
the other one is :COLON is it an idea ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society ?QUESTIONMARK 
no protection .PERIOD 
or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea :COLON something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?QUESTIONMARK 
nowadays ,COMMA we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold .PERIOD 
it's a digital file .PERIOD 
it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .PERIOD 
and these things ,COMMA because we can copy and transmit them so easily ,COMMA actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and ,COMMA let me tell you ,COMMA we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out .PERIOD 
they're smart .PERIOD 
i'm with one .PERIOD he's my boyfriend ,COMMA he's okay .PERIOD 
he's smart ,COMMA he's smart .PERIOD 
but you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out ,COMMA trying to figure out :COLON what is the kind of ownership model ,COMMA in a digital world ,COMMA that's going to lead to the most innovation ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .PERIOD 
if you want more information about this research project ,COMMA please visit our website :COLON it's readytoshareorg .PERIOD 
and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
this strange-looking plant is called the llareta .PERIOD 
what looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches ,COMMA each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it .PERIOD 
it also happens to be a relative of parsley .PERIOD 
for the past five years ,COMMA i've been researching ,COMMA working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are <NUM> years old and older .PERIOD 
the project is part art and part science .PERIOD 
there's an environmental component .PERIOD 
i selected <NUM> years as my minimum age because i wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there .PERIOD 
what you're looking at now is a tree called jomon sugi ,COMMA living on the remote island of yakushima .PERIOD 
the tree was in part a catalyst for the project .PERIOD 
it wasn't until later ,COMMA when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project .PERIOD 
so it was the slow churn ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
i think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art ,COMMA science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on .PERIOD 
so i started researching ,COMMA and to my surprise ,COMMA this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences .PERIOD 
and -- perhaps naively -- i was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity .PERIOD 
so what you're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum ,COMMA or map lichen ,COMMA and this is around <NUM> years old and lives in greenland ,COMMA which is a long way to go for some lichens .PERIOD 
visiting greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north .PERIOD 
it was very primal and more remote than anything i'd ever experienced before .PERIOD 
and this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences .PERIOD 
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord ,COMMA only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .PERIOD 
and it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail ,COMMA so i was literally left to my own devices .PERIOD 
but luckily ,COMMA it worked out obviously ,COMMA but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected .PERIOD 
and then a few days later ,COMMA we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite ,COMMA where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands .PERIOD 
it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's the lichens .PERIOD 
these lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years .PERIOD 
i think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective .PERIOD 
and what you're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern oregon .PERIOD 
and if the title searching for armillaria death rings ,COMMA sounds ominous ,COMMA it is .PERIOD 
the armillaria is actually a predatory fungus ,COMMA killing certain species of trees in the forest .PERIOD 
it's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the humongous fungus because it happens to be one of the world's largest organisms as well .PERIOD 
so with the help of some biologists studying the fungus ,COMMA i got some maps and some gps coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings ,COMMA the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees .PERIOD 
so i'm not sure if there are any in this photo ,COMMA but i do know the fungus is down there .PERIOD 
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree .PERIOD 
so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus ,COMMA and what it's doing -- it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients .PERIOD 
so this strategy has served it pretty well -- it's <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and then from underground to underwater .PERIOD 
this is a brain coral living in tobago that's around <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and i had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one .PERIOD 
this is at about <NUM> feet or <NUM> meters ,COMMA depth .PERIOD 
and you'll see ,COMMA there's some damage to the surface of the coral .PERIOD 
that was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it ,COMMA though luckily ,COMMA they lost interest before killing it .PERIOD 
luckily still ,COMMA it seems to be out of harm's way of the recent oil spill .PERIOD 
but that being said ,COMMA we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet ,COMMA and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen .PERIOD 
now this is something that i think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet .PERIOD 
this is clonal colony of quaking aspen trees ,COMMA living in utah ,COMMA that is literally <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree .PERIOD 
imagine that it's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system .PERIOD 
so what you have is one giant ,COMMA interconnected ,COMMA genetically identical individual that's been living for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
it also happens to be male and ,COMMA in theory immortal .PERIOD 
this is the spruce gran picea ,COMMA which at <NUM> years is a mere babe in the woods .PERIOD 
the location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection .PERIOD 
as it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain ,COMMA the vegetation zone is actually changing .PERIOD 
so we don't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them .PERIOD 
this is the fortingall yew -- no ,COMMA i'm just kidding -- this is the fortingall yew .PERIOD 
but i put that slide in there because i'm often asked if there are any animals in the project .PERIOD 
and aside from coral ,COMMA the answer is no .PERIOD 
rachel sussman :COLON <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA <NUM> is the oldest living tortoise ,COMMA so nowhere near <NUM> .PERIOD 
the most interesting discovery of late ,COMMA i think is the so-called immortal jellyfish ,COMMA which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity .PERIOD 
so that being said ,COMMA it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild .PERIOD 
and back to the yew here .PERIOD 
so as you can see ,COMMA it's in a churchyard ;SEMICOLON it's in scotland .PERIOD it's behind a protective wall .PERIOD 
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the uk ,COMMA but if you do the math ,COMMA you'll remember it's actually the yew trees that were there first ,COMMA then the churches .PERIOD 
and now down to another part of the world .PERIOD 
and we saw a number of them ,COMMA and this is most likely the oldest .PERIOD 
it's around <NUM> ,COMMA and it's called the sagole baobab .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA i think of all of these organisms as palimpsests .PERIOD 
and the baobabs in particular are a great example of this .PERIOD 
you can see that this one has names carved into its trunk ,COMMA but it also records some natural events .PERIOD 
so the baobabs ,COMMA as they get older ,COMMA tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out .PERIOD 
and this can create great natural shelters for animals ,COMMA but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses ,COMMA including a bar ,COMMA a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree .PERIOD 
and this brings me to another favorite of mine -- i think ,COMMA because it is just so unusual .PERIOD 
this plant is called the welwitschia ,COMMA and it lives only in parts of coastal namibia and angola ,COMMA where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea .PERIOD 
and what's more ,COMMA it's actually a tree .PERIOD 
it's a primitive conifer .PERIOD 
you'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center .PERIOD 
and what looks like two big heaps of leaves ,COMMA is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time .PERIOD 
i spoke to a biologist at the kirstenbosch botanical garden in capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from ,COMMA and his thought was that if you travel around namibia ,COMMA you see that there are a number of petrified forests ,COMMA and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees ,COMMA and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from .PERIOD 
so his thought was that flooding in the north of africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago ,COMMA and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment .PERIOD 
this is what i think is the most poetic of the oldest living things .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i spoke to a botanist at the pretoria botanical garden ,COMMA who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region .PERIOD 
it's bushfelt region ,COMMA which is dry and prone to a lot of fires ,COMMA as so what these trees have done is ,COMMA if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree ,COMMA and that this is ground level ,COMMA imagine that the whole thing ,COMMA that whole bulk of the tree ,COMMA migrated underground ,COMMA and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface .PERIOD 
that way ,COMMA when a fire roars through ,COMMA it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed .PERIOD 
these also tend to grow clonally ,COMMA the oldest of which is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
back in the us ,COMMA there's a couple plants of similar age .PERIOD 
this is the clonal creosote bush ,COMMA which is around <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
if you've been in the american west ,COMMA you know the creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous ,COMMA but that being said ,COMMA you see that this has this unique ,COMMA circular form .PERIOD 
and what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape .PERIOD 
and it's one -- again ,COMMA that interconnected root system ,COMMA making it one genetically identical individual .PERIOD 
it also has a friend nearby -- well ,COMMA i think they're friends .PERIOD 
this is the clonal mojave yucca ,COMMA it's about a mile away ,COMMA and it's a little bit older than <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and you see it has that similar circular form .PERIOD 
and there's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .PERIOD 
and both of these ,COMMA the yucca and the creosote bush ,COMMA live on bureau of land management land ,COMMA and that's very different from being protected in a national park .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this land is designated for recreational all-terrain vehicle use .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now i want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet .PERIOD 
this is siberian actinobacteria ,COMMA which is between <NUM> and <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours .PERIOD 
and what they found ,COMMA by doing research into the permafrost ,COMMA was this bacteria .PERIOD 
and what that means is that it's not dormant -- it's actually been living and growing for half a million years .PERIOD 
it's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things ,COMMA because if the permafrost melts ,COMMA it won't survive .PERIOD 
this is a map that i've put together of the oldest living things ,COMMA so you can get a sense of where they are ;SEMICOLON you see they're all over the world .PERIOD 
the blue flags represent things that i've already photographed ,COMMA and the reds are places that i'm still trying to get to .PERIOD 
you'll see also ,COMMA there's a flag on antarctica .PERIOD 
i'm trying to travel there to find <NUM> year-old moss ,COMMA which lives on the antarctic peninsula .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i probably have about two more years left on this project -- on this phase of the project ,COMMA but after five years ,COMMA i really feel like i know what's at the heart of this work .PERIOD 
the oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past ,COMMA a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future .PERIOD 
they've survived for millennia in desert ,COMMA in the permafrost ,COMMA at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean .PERIOD 
they've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments ,COMMA but now some of them are in jeopardy ,COMMA and they can't just get up and get out of the way .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days ,COMMA talking to groups of students and professionals ,COMMA and everywhere i'm finding that i hear similar themes .PERIOD 
on the one hand ,COMMA people say ,COMMA the time for change is now .PERIOD 
they want to be part of it .PERIOD 
they talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning .PERIOD 
but on the other hand ,COMMA i hear people talking about fear ,COMMA a sense of risk-aversion .PERIOD 
they say ,COMMA i really want to follow a life of purpose ,COMMA but i don't know where to start .PERIOD 
i don't want to disappoint my family or friends .PERIOD 
i work in global poverty .PERIOD 
and they say ,COMMA i want to work in global poverty ,COMMA but what will it mean about my career ?QUESTIONMARK 
will i be marginalized ?QUESTIONMARK 
will i not make enough money ?QUESTIONMARK 
will i never get married or have children ?QUESTIONMARK 
and as a woman who didn't get married until i was a lot older -- and i'm glad i waited -- -- and has no children ,COMMA i look at these young people and i say ,COMMA your job is not to be perfect .PERIOD 
your job is only to be human .PERIOD 
and nothing important happens in life without a cost .PERIOD 
these conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level .PERIOD 
we don't talk about the sacrifice .PERIOD 
one of my favorite quotes from literature was written by tillie olsen ,COMMA the great american writer from the south .PERIOD 
in a short story called oh yes ,COMMA she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little african american girl ,COMMA and she looks at her child with a sense of pride ,COMMA but she also wonders ,COMMA what price will she pay ?QUESTIONMARK 
better immersion than to live untouched .PERIOD 
but the real question is ,COMMA what is the cost of not daring ?QUESTIONMARK 
what is the cost of not trying ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion .PERIOD 
one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok .PERIOD 
she was a leader of the menominee tribe ,COMMA a native american peoples .PERIOD 
and she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future ,COMMA looking at them from the earth ,COMMA and they would look at them ,COMMA holding them as stewards for that future .PERIOD 
ingrid understood that we are connected to each other ,COMMA not only as human beings ,COMMA but to every living thing on the planet .PERIOD 
and tragically ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA when she was in colombia working with the u'wa people ,COMMA focused on preserving their culture and language ,COMMA she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the farc .PERIOD 
and whenever we would gather the fellows after that ,COMMA we would leave a chair empty for her spirit .PERIOD 
and more than a decade later ,COMMA when i talk to ngo fellows ,COMMA whether in trenton ,COMMA new jersey or the office of the white house ,COMMA and we talk about ingrid ,COMMA they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission .PERIOD 
and when we think about legacy ,COMMA i can think of no more powerful one ,COMMA despite how short her life was .PERIOD 
and i've been touched by cambodian women -- beautiful women ,COMMA women who held the tradition of the classical dance in cambodia .PERIOD 
and i met them in the early '90s .PERIOD 
in the 1970s ,COMMA under the pol pot regime ,COMMA the khmer rouge killed over a million people ,COMMA and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals ,COMMA the artists ,COMMA the dancers .PERIOD 
and at the end of the war ,COMMA there were only <NUM> of these classical dancers still living .PERIOD 
and the women ,COMMA who i was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors ,COMMA told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps .PERIOD 
and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage ,COMMA her hands at her side ,COMMA and she talked about the reunion of the <NUM> after the war and how extraordinary it was .PERIOD 
and these big tears fell down her face ,COMMA but she never lifted her hands to move them .PERIOD 
and the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls ,COMMA because they had grown too old already ,COMMA but the next generation .PERIOD 
and i sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them ,COMMA wearing these beautiful silk colors .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA after all this atrocity ,COMMA this is how human beings really pray .PERIOD 
because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .PERIOD 
and what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure .PERIOD 
i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership .PERIOD 
and i have learned that power ,COMMA particularly in its absolute form ,COMMA is an equal opportunity provider .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i moved to rwanda ,COMMA and i worked with a very small group of rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank .PERIOD 
and one of the women was agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in rwanda ,COMMA and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of rwanda .PERIOD 
we built this institution based on social justice ,COMMA gender equity ,COMMA this idea of empowering women .PERIOD 
but agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end .PERIOD 
and though she had been part of building a liberal party ,COMMA a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance ,COMMA about three months before the genocide ,COMMA she switched parties and joined the extremist party ,COMMA hutu power ,COMMA and she became the minister of justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women .PERIOD 
she was convicted of category one crimes of genocide .PERIOD 
and i would visit her in the prisons ,COMMA sitting side-by-side ,COMMA knees touching ,COMMA and i would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us ,COMMA but that maybe it's not monsters so much ,COMMA but the broken parts of ourselves ,COMMA sadnesses ,COMMA secret shame ,COMMA and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts ,COMMA those fragments ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA and to make us look at other beings ,COMMA human beings ,COMMA as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme ,COMMA to do terrible things .PERIOD 
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men .PERIOD 
i've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .PERIOD 
and so in a gathering where we're focused on women ,COMMA while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them ,COMMA we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered ,COMMA unable to provide .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job ,COMMA no education ,COMMA no possibility ,COMMA well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun .PERIOD 
sometimes very small investments can release enormous ,COMMA infinite potential that exists in all of us .PERIOD 
one of the acumen fund fellows at my organization ,COMMA suraj sudhakar ,COMMA has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective .PERIOD 
and he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world ,COMMA kibera .PERIOD 
and they're incredible guys .PERIOD 
and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums ,COMMA and they're reading many ted authors and liking it .PERIOD 
and then they created a business plan competition .PERIOD 
then they decided that they would do tedx's .PERIOD 
and i have learned so much from chris and kevin and alex and herbert and all of these young men .PERIOD 
alex ,COMMA in some ways ,COMMA said it best .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA we used to feel like nobodies ,COMMA but now we feel like somebodies .PERIOD 
and i think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link .PERIOD 
what we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other .PERIOD 
and the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these tedx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on hiv ,COMMA or at best ,COMMA microfinance .PERIOD 
and they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about kibera and mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives ,COMMA the graffiti artists ,COMMA the teachers and the entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
and they're doing it .PERIOD 
and my hat's off to you in kibera .PERIOD 
my own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive .PERIOD 
at acumen fund ,COMMA we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity ,COMMA but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions .PERIOD 
we leave our money for <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA and when we get it back ,COMMA we invest in other innovations that focus on change .PERIOD 
i know it works .PERIOD 
we've invested more than <NUM> million dollars in <NUM> companies ,COMMA and those companies have brought another <NUM> million dollars into these forgotten markets .PERIOD 
this year alone ,COMMA they've delivered <NUM> million services like maternal health care and housing ,COMMA emergency services ,COMMA solar energy ,COMMA so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems .PERIOD 
patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions ,COMMA easy categories ,COMMA because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument .PERIOD 
and ultimately ,COMMA we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact ,COMMA measuring what is most important to us .PERIOD 
and my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it ,COMMA but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways .PERIOD 
last may i had this extraordinary 24-hour period where i saw two visions of the world living side-by-side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence .PERIOD 
i happened to be in lahore ,COMMA pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers .PERIOD 
and the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully muslim .PERIOD 
and not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives ,COMMA but they did more ,COMMA because they created more hatred ,COMMA more rage ,COMMA more fear and certainly despair .PERIOD 
but less than <NUM> hours ,COMMA i was <NUM> miles away from those mosques ,COMMA visiting one of our acumen investees ,COMMA an incredible man ,COMMA jawad aslam ,COMMA who dares to live a life of immersion .PERIOD 
born and raised in baltimore ,COMMA he studied real estate ,COMMA worked in commercial real estate ,COMMA and after <NUM>/<NUM> decided he was going to pakistan to make a difference .PERIOD 
and he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital ,COMMA but he continued to pay a price .PERIOD 
he stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes .PERIOD 
it took almost two years just to register the land .PERIOD 
but i saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA <NUM> people live in <NUM> houses in this beautiful community .PERIOD 
and there's schools and clinics and shops .PERIOD 
but there's only one mosque .PERIOD 
and so i asked jawad ,COMMA how do you guys navigate ?QUESTIONMARK this is a really diverse community .PERIOD 
who gets to use the mosque on fridays ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was hard ,COMMA it was a difficult road ,COMMA but ultimately the leaders of the community came together ,COMMA realizing we only have each other .PERIOD 
and we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams ,COMMA and those imams would take turns ,COMMA they would rotate who would say friday prayer .PERIOD 
but the whole community ,COMMA all the different sects ,COMMA including shi'a and sunni ,COMMA would sit together and pray .PERIOD 
we need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds .PERIOD 
we face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis ,COMMA global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness .PERIOD 
and every day we have a choice .PERIOD 
or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation ,COMMA transcendence ,COMMA compassion and love ,COMMA but also accountability and justice .PERIOD 
and he tells this incredible story about working with a little six-year-old girl named ruby bridges ,COMMA the first child to desegregate schools in the south -- in this case ,COMMA new orleans .PERIOD 
and he said that every day this six-year-old ,COMMA dressed in her beautiful dress ,COMMA would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily ,COMMA calling her a monster ,COMMA threatening to poison her -- distorted faces .PERIOD 
and every day he would watch her ,COMMA and it looked like she was talking to the people .PERIOD 
and he would say ,COMMA ruby ,COMMA what are you saying ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she'd say ,COMMA i'm not talking .PERIOD 
and finally he said ,COMMA ruby ,COMMA i see that you're talking .PERIOD 
what are you saying ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she said ,COMMA dr .PERIOD coles ,COMMA i am not talking ;SEMICOLON i'm praying .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are you praying ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she said ,COMMA i'm praying ,COMMA 'father ,COMMA forgive them ,COMMA for they know not what they are doing' at age six ,COMMA this child was living a life of immersion ,COMMA and her family paid a price for it .PERIOD 
but she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education .PERIOD 
but especially when i was talking to the african women ,COMMA i sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA so i conclude that ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA leadership is like a panicle of rice .PERIOD 
because at the height of the season ,COMMA at the height of its powers ,COMMA it's beautiful ,COMMA it's green ,COMMA it nourishes the world ,COMMA it reaches to the heavens .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA but right before the harvest ,COMMA it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came .PERIOD 
we need leaders .PERIOD 
we ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can ,COMMA ourselves ,COMMA extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man ,COMMA woman and child on this planet .PERIOD 
and we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone .PERIOD 
and it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written .PERIOD 
our lives are so short ,COMMA and our time on this planet is so precious ,COMMA and all we have is each other .PERIOD 
so may each of you live lives of immersion .PERIOD 
they won't necessarily be easy lives ,COMMA but in the end ,COMMA it is all that will sustain us .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
good morning .PERIOD 
let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all ,COMMA leonardo da vinci .PERIOD 
we're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings ,COMMA his paintings ,COMMA his inventions ,COMMA his writings .PERIOD 
thousands of books have been written about him ,COMMA but there's controversy ,COMMA and it remains ,COMMA about his looks .PERIOD 
even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what do you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's find out .PERIOD 
leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .PERIOD 
he drew people ,COMMA anatomy ,COMMA plants ,COMMA animals ,COMMA landscapes ,COMMA buildings ,COMMA water ,COMMA everything .PERIOD 
but no faces ?QUESTIONMARK 
his contemporaries made faces ,COMMA like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time .PERIOD 
so let's try to find them .PERIOD 
i think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits ,COMMA we would find his face looking at us .PERIOD 
so i looked at all of his drawings ,COMMA more than <NUM> ,COMMA and looked for male portraits .PERIOD 
there are about <NUM> ,COMMA you see them here .PERIOD 
which ones of these could be self-portraits ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA for that they have to be done as we just saw ,COMMA en face or three-quarters .PERIOD 
so we can eliminate all the profiles .PERIOD 
so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized .PERIOD 
and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome ,COMMA even beautiful man .PERIOD 
so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .PERIOD 
and look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill .PERIOD 
and here they are .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA the old man is there ,COMMA as is this famous pen drawing of the homo vitruvianus .PERIOD 
and lastly ,COMMA the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted ,COMMA the musician .PERIOD 
before we go into these faces ,COMMA i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .PERIOD 
i've made more than <NUM> portraits myself for newspapers ,COMMA over the course of <NUM> -- <NUM> years ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA <NUM> years only .PERIOD 
but there are <NUM> ,COMMA and very few artists have drawn so many faces .PERIOD 
so i know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA now let's look at these three portraits .PERIOD 
and hold onto your seats ,COMMA because if we zoom in on those faces ,COMMA remark how they have the same broad forehead ,COMMA the horizontal eyebrows ,COMMA the long nose ,COMMA the curved lips and the small ,COMMA well-developed chin .PERIOD 
i couldn't believe my eyes when i first saw that .PERIOD 
there is no reason why these portraits should look alike .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA are they made in the right order ?QUESTIONMARK 
the young man should be made first .PERIOD 
and as you see here from the years that they were created ,COMMA it is indeed the case .PERIOD 
what was the age of leonardo at the time ?QUESTIONMARK does that fit ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA it does .PERIOD he was <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> and <NUM> when these were made .PERIOD 
so we have three pictures ,COMMA potentially of the same person of the same age as leonardo at the time .PERIOD 
but how do we know it's him ,COMMA and not someone else ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA we need a reference .PERIOD 
and here's the only picture of leonardo that's widely accepted .PERIOD 
it's a statue made by verrocchio ,COMMA of david ,COMMA for which leonardo posed as a boy of <NUM> .PERIOD 
and if we now compare the face of the statue ,COMMA with the face of the musician ,COMMA you see the very same features again .PERIOD 
the statue is the reference ,COMMA and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces .PERIOD 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA this story has not yet been published .PERIOD 
it's only proper that you here at ted hear and see it first .PERIOD 
the icon of icons finally has a face .PERIOD 
here he is :COLON leonardo da vinci .PERIOD 
this machine ,COMMA which we all have residing in our skulls ,COMMA reminds me of an aphorism ,COMMA of a comment of woody allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull .PERIOD 
and it's this machine .PERIOD 
and it's constructed for change .PERIOD it's all about change .PERIOD 
it confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today ,COMMA things today that we couldn't do yesterday .PERIOD 
and of course it's born stupid .PERIOD 
the last time you were in the presence of a baby -- this happens to be my granddaughter ,COMMA mitra .PERIOD 
isn't she fabulous ?QUESTIONMARK 
but nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb -- nonetheless she had very limited abilities ,COMMA as does every infant at the time of normal ,COMMA natural full-term birth .PERIOD 
if we were to assay her perceptual abilities ,COMMA they would be crude .PERIOD 
there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on .PERIOD 
in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant .PERIOD 
infants don't respond to much .PERIOD 
there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board .PERIOD 
and they can only in a very primitive way ,COMMA and in a very limited way control their movements .PERIOD 
it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it ,COMMA usually to the mouth .PERIOD 
and it will be some months beforeward ,COMMA and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles ,COMMA to rolling over ,COMMA and sitting up ,COMMA and crawling ,COMMA standing ,COMMA walking ,COMMA before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance .PERIOD 
by this age the brain can actually store .PERIOD 
and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands ,COMMA potentially millions of ways .PERIOD 
by this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities .PERIOD 
and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills .PERIOD 
this brain is very much a thinking machine .PERIOD 
and by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain ,COMMA it has a person on board .PERIOD 
and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development .PERIOD 
and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement .PERIOD 
now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head .PERIOD 
and where this boy comes from ,COMMA sao paulo ,COMMA brazil ,COMMA about <NUM> percent of boys of his age have this ability .PERIOD 
and if you did he'd probably be from sao paulo .PERIOD 
that's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments .PERIOD 
that environment extends into our contemporary culture ,COMMA the thing our brain is challenged with .PERIOD 
because what we've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories .PERIOD 
every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity ,COMMA the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine .PERIOD 
in an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory ,COMMA and that define us as acting ,COMMA moving ,COMMA thinking creatures .PERIOD 
now we study this ,COMMA as the nerdy ,COMMA laboratory ,COMMA university-based scientists that we are ,COMMA by engaging the brains of animals like rats ,COMMA or monkeys ,COMMA or of this particularly curious creature -- one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth -- to engage them in learning new skills and abilities .PERIOD 
in fact we do this in individuals of any age ,COMMA in these different species -- that is to say from infancies ,COMMA infancy up to adulthood and old age .PERIOD 
so we might engage a rat ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub-skills ,COMMA or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read .PERIOD 
or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance .PERIOD 
the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period .PERIOD 
this is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning ,COMMA per se ,COMMA to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain .PERIOD 
all it takes for example in the sound domain ,COMMA is exposure to sound .PERIOD 
and the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared .PERIOD 
so for example i can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound ,COMMA a repertoire of sound that i make up ,COMMA that i make ,COMMA just by exposure ,COMMA artificially important to the animal and its young brain .PERIOD 
and what i see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized ,COMMA within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way .PERIOD 
the sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal :COLON i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable ,COMMA like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child .PERIOD 
it actually exaggerates their separateness of representation ,COMMA in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms .PERIOD 
or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound .PERIOD 
i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan ,COMMA in the presence of continuous noise .PERIOD 
and when i do that i actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound .PERIOD 
and i frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence .PERIOD 
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .PERIOD 
and they account for ,COMMA for example the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor in every normally developing baby .PERIOD 
and so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA in their language abilities at an older age .PERIOD 
now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context .PERIOD 
i don't have to be paying attention to what i hear .PERIOD 
the input doesn't really have to be meaningful .PERIOD 
i don't have to be in a behavioral context .PERIOD 
this is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially ,COMMA so that it can act selectively ,COMMA so that the creature that wears it ,COMMA that carries it ,COMMA can begin to operate on it in a selective way .PERIOD 
in the next great epoch of life ,COMMA which applies for most of life ,COMMA the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities .PERIOD 
and in this epoch ,COMMA which extends from late in the first year of life to death ;SEMICOLON it's actually doing this under behavioral control .PERIOD 
and that's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain .PERIOD 
and it's focusing on skill after skill ,COMMA or ability after ability ,COMMA under specific attentional control .PERIOD 
it's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior .PERIOD 
this is actually very powerful .PERIOD 
this lifelong capacity for plasticity ,COMMA for brain change ,COMMA is powerfully expressed .PERIOD 
it is the basis of our real differentiation ,COMMA one individual from another .PERIOD 
you can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill ,COMMA and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels .PERIOD 
so here is a very simple experiment .PERIOD 
it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence in marseilles .PERIOD 
it's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon .PERIOD 
the monkey actually mastered the task in about <NUM> practice tries .PERIOD 
so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all .PERIOD 
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .PERIOD 
those tries were elaborate .PERIOD 
each attempt was substantially different from the other .PERIOD 
but the monkey gradually developed a strategy .PERIOD 
and <NUM> or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails .PERIOD 
at this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way :COLON very beautifully regulated and highly repeated ,COMMA trial to trial .PERIOD 
and we see that it's distorted .PERIOD 
we can track these changes ,COMMA and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time .PERIOD 
and here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey .PERIOD 
now this is a map ,COMMA down in the surface of the brain ,COMMA in which ,COMMA in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses ,COMMA location by location ,COMMA in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons .PERIOD 
we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain .PERIOD 
and that is indicated in the pink .PERIOD we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger .PERIOD 
these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool .PERIOD 
if we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey ,COMMA we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged .PERIOD 
in other words there is still a single ,COMMA simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body .PERIOD 
monkey has like you have .PERIOD 
and yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain .PERIOD 
the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces .PERIOD 
and that is an unknown -- unsuspected ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA by you -- part of acquiring the skill or ability .PERIOD 
now actually we've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task .PERIOD 
so for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey .PERIOD 
we look in cortical areas that control specific movements ,COMMA and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior ,COMMA and so forth .PERIOD 
they are all remodeled .PERIOD they all become specialized for the task at hand .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> or <NUM> cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this .PERIOD 
and that represents in your brain ,COMMA really massive change .PERIOD 
it represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions ,COMMA possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain .PERIOD 
this is constructed by physical change .PERIOD 
and the level of construction that occurs is massive .PERIOD 
think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general .PERIOD 
or acquiring their native language abilities .PERIOD 
the changes are massive .PERIOD 
what it's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain .PERIOD 
because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context .PERIOD 
it's what you pay attention to .PERIOD 
it's what's rewarding to you .PERIOD 
it's what the brain regards ,COMMA itself ,COMMA as positive and important to you .PERIOD 
it's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization .PERIOD 
and that underlies your specialization .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time ,COMMA in context .PERIOD 
and that's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time .PERIOD 
the brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context .PERIOD 
now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that's occurred in your brain is you .PERIOD 
billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver ,COMMA or yourself as the actor ,COMMA yourself as the thinker ,COMMA yourself as the mover .PERIOD 
billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver ,COMMA and that result in the embodiment of you .PERIOD 
you are constructed ,COMMA your self is constructed from these billions of events .PERIOD 
it's constructed .PERIOD it's created in your brain .PERIOD 
and it's created in the brain via physical change .PERIOD 
this is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories ,COMMA and vastly different experiences ,COMMA that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self ,COMMA of personhood .PERIOD 
now we've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops ,COMMA and elaborates their skills and abilities ,COMMA but also try to understand the origins of impairment ,COMMA and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child ,COMMA or an adult .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity-based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and ,COMMA thereafter ,COMMA as a reader .PERIOD 
and i'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science ,COMMA first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA by using it in a targeted approach we're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age .PERIOD 
so the first example i'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments .PERIOD 
we now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments ,COMMA and that are going to struggle to learn to read ,COMMA is that their language processor is created in a defective form .PERIOD 
and the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby's brain's life the machine process is noisy .PERIOD 
it's that simple .PERIOD 
it's a signal-to-noise problem .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there are a lot of things that contribute to that .PERIOD 
there are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier .PERIOD 
now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears .PERIOD 
if any -- those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation .PERIOD 
we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively ;SEMICOLON we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities ;SEMICOLON and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read .PERIOD 
most of them would be intellectual and academic failures .PERIOD 
that's disappeared .PERIOD that no longer applies .PERIOD 
that inherited weakness ,COMMA that inherited condition has evaporated .PERIOD 
we don't hear about that anymore .PERIOD where did it go ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA it was understood by a dutch surgeon ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that if you simply fix the problem early enough ,COMMA when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately ,COMMA in this initial set up time in the critical period ,COMMA none of that happens .PERIOD 
what are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it ?QUESTIONMARK 
you're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears ,COMMA which have had them reliably full .PERIOD 
every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled .PERIOD 
it's degraded .PERIOD 
the child's native language is such a case is not english .PERIOD 
it's not japanese .PERIOD 
it's muffled english .PERIOD it's degraded japanese .PERIOD 
it's crap .PERIOD 
and the brain specializes for it .PERIOD 
it creates a representation of language crap .PERIOD 
and then the child is stuck with it .PERIOD 
now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear .PERIOD 
it can also happen in the brain .PERIOD 
the brain itself can be noisy .PERIOD it's commonly noisy .PERIOD 
there are many inherited faults that can make it noisier .PERIOD 
and the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded .PERIOD 
and that results in defective representations of sounds of words -- not normal -- a different strategy ,COMMA by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants .PERIOD 
and you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants .PERIOD 
they are about an order of magnitude longer ,COMMA about <NUM> times longer in duration on average ,COMMA than in a normal child .PERIOD 
space constants are about three times greater .PERIOD 
such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain .PERIOD 
of course they will .PERIOD because as a receiver of language ,COMMA they are receiving it and representing it ,COMMA and in information it's representing crap .PERIOD 
and they are going to have poor reading skills .PERIOD 
because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form .PERIOD 
if you don't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense .PERIOD 
and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology .PERIOD 
then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation ,COMMA in their operations in language ,COMMA and their operations in reading -- we document that abnormal neurology .PERIOD 
the point is is that you can train the brain out of this .PERIOD 
a way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it .PERIOD 
and we've accomplished that in about <NUM> kids today .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA probably about <NUM> children are being trained as we speak .PERIOD 
and actually when you look at the impacts ,COMMA the impacts are substantial .PERIOD 
so here we're looking at the normal distribution .PERIOD 
what we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution .PERIOD 
this is from about <NUM> children .PERIOD 
this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities .PERIOD 
this is like an iq test for language .PERIOD 
the impact in the distribution ,COMMA if you trained every child in the united states ,COMMA would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution .PERIOD 
think of a classroom of children in the language arts .PERIOD 
think of the children on the slow side of the class .PERIOD 
we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side .PERIOD 
in addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production .PERIOD 
and an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training -- that is to say reading .PERIOD 
and to a large extent it fixes the brain .PERIOD 
you can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford ,COMMA and mit ,COMMA and ucsf ,COMMA and ucla ,COMMA and a number of other institutions .PERIOD 
and children operating in various language behaviors ,COMMA or in various reading behaviors ,COMMA you see for the most extent ,COMMA for most children ,COMMA their neuronal responses ,COMMA complexly abnormal before you start ,COMMA are normalized by the training .PERIOD 
now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging .PERIOD 
where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery ,COMMA it's going south .PERIOD 
noise is increasing in the brain .PERIOD 
and learning modulation and control is deteriorating .PERIOD 
and you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the brain is representing language again .PERIOD 
just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning ,COMMA it's going back into chaos in the end .PERIOD 
this results in declines in memory in cognition ,COMMA and in postural ability and agility .PERIOD 
it turns out you can train the brain of such an individual -- this is a small population of such individuals -- train equally intensively for about <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
these are 80- to 90-year-olds .PERIOD 
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory ,COMMA of their ability to remember things after a delay ,COMMA of their ability to control their attention ,COMMA their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .PERIOD 
the overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations .PERIOD 
that means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution ,COMMA and i'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities ,COMMA the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution .PERIOD 
it means that most people who are at risk for senility ,COMMA more or less immediately ,COMMA are now in a protected position .PERIOD 
my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers ,COMMA because i think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids .PERIOD 
my main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies .PERIOD 
and in older age conditions like parkinsonism ,COMMA and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia .PERIOD 
your issues as it relates to this science ,COMMA is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA a well-ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it ,COMMA is key .PERIOD 
the other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself .PERIOD 
now that you know ,COMMA now that science is telling us that you are in charge ,COMMA that it's under your control ,COMMA that your happiness ,COMMA your well-being ,COMMA your abilities ,COMMA your capacities ,COMMA are capable of continuous modification ,COMMA continuous improvement ,COMMA and you're the responsible agent and party .PERIOD 
it will be a long time before they really understand it .PERIOD 
now that's another issue and not my fault .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
today i want to talk to you about swimming across the north pole ,COMMA across the most northern place in the whole world .PERIOD 
and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father .PERIOD 
he was a great storyteller .PERIOD 
he could tell a story about an event ,COMMA and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment .PERIOD 
he had been there and watched it go off .PERIOD 
and he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense ,COMMA that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes .PERIOD 
and he said that he could actually see an x-ray of his fingers ,COMMA because the light was so bright .PERIOD 
and i know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very ,COMMA very big impact on my late father .PERIOD 
every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park .PERIOD 
he also told me about the great explorers .PERIOD 
he loved history .PERIOD he would tell me about captain scott walking all the way to the south pole and sir edmund hillary climbing up mount everest .PERIOD 
and so ever since i think i was just six years old ,COMMA i dreamed of going to the polar regions .PERIOD 
i really ,COMMA really wanted to go to the arctic .PERIOD 
there was something about that place which drew me to it .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA well ,COMMA sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true .PERIOD 
but seven years ago ,COMMA i went to the arctic for the first time .PERIOD 
and it was so beautiful that i've been back there ever since ,COMMA for the last seven years .PERIOD 
but i have seen that place change beyond all description ,COMMA just in that short period of time .PERIOD 
i have seen polar bears walking across very ,COMMA very thin ice in search of food .PERIOD 
i have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much .PERIOD 
and i have also ,COMMA every year ,COMMA seen less and less sea ice .PERIOD 
and i wanted the world to know what was happening up there .PERIOD 
in the two years before my swim ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away .PERIOD 
and i wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening .PERIOD 
so i decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world ,COMMA in a place which should be frozen over ,COMMA but which now is rapidly unfreezing .PERIOD 
and the message was very clear :COLON climate change is for real ,COMMA and we need to do something about it .PERIOD 
and we need to do something about it right now .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA swimming across the north pole ,COMMA it's not an ordinary thing to do .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA just to put it in perspective ,COMMA <NUM> degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool .PERIOD 
this morning ,COMMA the temperature of the english channel was <NUM> degrees .PERIOD 
the passengers who fell off the titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade .PERIOD 
and the water at the north pole is minus <NUM> .PERIOD 
it's fucking freezing .PERIOD 
i'm sorry ,COMMA but there is no other way to describe it .PERIOD 
and so i had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task .PERIOD 
i assembled this team of <NUM> people from <NUM> nations .PERIOD 
some people think that swimming is a very solo sport ,COMMA you just dive into the sea and off you go .PERIOD 
it couldn't be further from the truth for me .PERIOD 
and i then went and did a huge amount of training ,COMMA swimming in icy water ,COMMA backwards and forwards .PERIOD 
but the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen .PERIOD 
and i had to visualize the swim .PERIOD 
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .PERIOD 
i had to taste the salt water in my mouth .PERIOD 
i had to see my coach screaming for me ,COMMA come on lewis !EXCLAMATIONMARK come on !EXCLAMATIONMARK go !EXCLAMATIONMARK go !EXCLAMATIONMARK go !EXCLAMATIONMARK don't slow down !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and so i literally swam across the north pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA after a year of training ,COMMA i felt ready .PERIOD 
i felt confident that i could actually do this swim .PERIOD 
so myself and the five members of the team ,COMMA we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the north pole .PERIOD 
and on day four ,COMMA we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim .PERIOD 
i had never swum in water of minus <NUM> degrees before ,COMMA because it's just impossible to train in those types of conditions .PERIOD 
so we stopped the ship ,COMMA as you do .PERIOD 
we all got down onto the ice ,COMMA and i then got into my swimming costume and i dived into the sea .PERIOD 
i have never in my life felt anything like that moment .PERIOD 
i could barely breathe .PERIOD i was gasping for air .PERIOD 
i was hyperventilating so much ,COMMA and within seconds my hands were numb .PERIOD 
and it was -- the paradox is that you're in freezing cold water ,COMMA but actually you're on fire .PERIOD 
i swam as hard as i could for five minutes .PERIOD 
i climbed out of the ice .PERIOD 
and i remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock ,COMMA because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages .PERIOD 
and they were swollen so much ,COMMA i couldn't even close them .PERIOD 
what had happened is that we are made partially of water ,COMMA and when water freezes it expands .PERIOD 
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded .PERIOD 
and they had burst .PERIOD and i was in so much agony .PERIOD 
i immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower .PERIOD 
and i remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA in two days' time ,COMMA i was going to do this swim across the north pole .PERIOD 
i was going to try and do a 20-minute swim ,COMMA for one kilometer across the north pole .PERIOD 
and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father ,COMMA was just going out the window .PERIOD 
there is no possibility that this was going to happen .PERIOD 
and i remember then getting out of the shower and realizing i couldn't even feel my hands .PERIOD 
the next morning ,COMMA i woke up and i was in such a state of depression ,COMMA and all i could think about was sir ranulph fiennes .PERIOD 
for those of you who don't know him ,COMMA he's the great british explorer .PERIOD 
a number of years ago ,COMMA he tried to ski all the way to the north pole .PERIOD 
he accidentally fell through the ice into the sea .PERIOD 
and after just three minutes in that water ,COMMA he was able to get himself out .PERIOD 
and his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to england .PERIOD 
he went to a local hospital and there they said ,COMMA ran ,COMMA there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers .PERIOD 
and ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself .PERIOD 
and all i could think of was ,COMMA if that happened to ran after three minutes ,COMMA and i can't feel my hands after five minutes ,COMMA what on earth is going to happen if i try <NUM> minutes ?QUESTIONMARK 
at the very best ,COMMA i'm going to end up losing some fingers .PERIOD 
and at worst ,COMMA i didn't even want to think about it .PERIOD 
we carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the north pole .PERIOD 
and my close friend david ,COMMA he saw the way i was thinking ,COMMA and he came up to me and he said ,COMMA lewis ,COMMA i've known you since you were <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
i've known you ,COMMA and i know ,COMMA lewis ,COMMA deep down ,COMMA right deep down here ,COMMA that you are going to make this swim .PERIOD 
i so believe in you lewis .PERIOD i've seen the way you've been training .PERIOD 
and i realize the reason why you're going to do this .PERIOD 
this is such an important swim .PERIOD 
we stand at a very ,COMMA very important moment in this history ,COMMA and you're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders .PERIOD 
lewis ,COMMA have the courage to go in there ,COMMA because we are going to look after you every moment of it .PERIOD 
and i just ,COMMA i got so much confidence from him saying that ,COMMA because he knew me so well .PERIOD 
so we carried on sailing and we arrived at the north pole .PERIOD 
and we stopped the ship ,COMMA and it was just as the scientists had predicted .PERIOD 
there were open patches of sea everywhere .PERIOD 
and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume .PERIOD 
and then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor ,COMMA which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate .PERIOD 
and then we walked out onto the ice .PERIOD 
i had never seen black water before .PERIOD 
and it is <NUM> meters deep .PERIOD 
and i said to myself ,COMMA lewis ,COMMA don't look left ,COMMA don't look right .PERIOD 
just scuttle forward and go for it .PERIOD 
and so i now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON we're just sailing out of harbor now ,COMMA and it's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally .PERIOD 
everything just looks so gray around here ,COMMA and looks so cold .PERIOD 
we've just seen our first polar bears .PERIOD 
it was absolutely magical .PERIOD 
a mother and a cub ,COMMA such a beautiful sight .PERIOD 
and to think that in <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years they could become extinct .PERIOD 
we're finally at the north pole .PERIOD this is months and months and months of dreaming to get here ,COMMA years of training and planning and preparation .PERIOD 
ooh .PERIOD in a couple of hours' time i'm going to get in here and do my swim .PERIOD 
amundson ,COMMA you ready ?QUESTIONMARK amudson :COLON ready .PERIOD 
lewis pugh :COLON ten seconds to swim .PERIOD ten seconds to swim .PERIOD 
take the goggles off .PERIOD take the goggles off !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
man :COLON take the shoes .PERIOD take the shoes .PERIOD 
well done lad !EXCLAMATIONMARK you did it !EXCLAMATIONMARK you did it lewis !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
you did it !EXCLAMATIONMARK you did it man !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
how on earth did we do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
man :COLON against the current !EXCLAMATIONMARK you did it against the current !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
thank you very much .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
audience :COLON encore !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i'd just like to end off by just saying this :COLON it took me four months again to feel my hands .PERIOD 
but was it worth it ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA absolutely it was .PERIOD 
there are very ,COMMA very few people who don't know now about what is happening in the arctic .PERIOD 
and people ask me ,COMMA lewis ,COMMA what can we do about climate change ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i say to them ,COMMA i think we need to do three things .PERIOD 
you saw during that video all those flags .PERIOD 
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .PERIOD 
and equally ,COMMA when it comes to climate change ,COMMA every single country is going to have to make cuts .PERIOD 
britain ,COMMA america ,COMMA japan ,COMMA south africa ,COMMA the congo .PERIOD 
all of us together ,COMMA we're all on the same ship together .PERIOD 
the second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time .PERIOD 
i remember ,COMMA just a few years ago ,COMMA speaking about climate change ,COMMA and people heckling me in the back and saying it doesn't even exist .PERIOD 
four or five children sitting behind a desk ,COMMA and even in those poorest conditions ,COMMA they all have a very ,COMMA very good grasp of climate change .PERIOD 
now is the time to believe .PERIOD 
we've come a long way .PERIOD we're doing good .PERIOD 
and that is ,COMMA what type of world do we want to live in ,COMMA and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world ?QUESTIONMARK 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD 
for the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy ,COMMA and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk .PERIOD 
i'll try to spin a story about energy ,COMMA and oil's a convenient starting place .PERIOD 
the talk will be broadly about energy ,COMMA but oil's a good place to start .PERIOD 
and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .PERIOD 
it's great stuff .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as far as it goes ,COMMA there's a lot of oil out there in the world .PERIOD 
here's my little pocket map of where it's all located .PERIOD 
a bigger one for you to look at .PERIOD 
but this is it ,COMMA this is the oil in the world .PERIOD 
geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is .PERIOD 
this is about <NUM> trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that's just one story about oil ,COMMA and we could end it there and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA oil's going to last forever because ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's just a lot of it .PERIOD 
but there's actually more to the story than that .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA if you think you're very far from some of this oil ,COMMA <NUM> meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world .PERIOD 
come talk to me about it ,COMMA i'll fill in some of the details if you want .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's one of the stories of oil ;SEMICOLON there's just a lot of it .PERIOD 
here's a little snapshot of <NUM> years of oil ,COMMA and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those <NUM> years .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA here's another little secret i'm going to tell you about :COLON for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems .PERIOD 
there was one kind of peak oil in <NUM> ,COMMA when oil represented <NUM> percent of global energy supply .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's about <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
it's been declining and i believe it will continue to decline .PERIOD 
gasoline consumption in the us .PERIOD probably peaked in <NUM> and is declining .PERIOD 
so oil is playing a less significant role every year .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA there was a peak oil ;SEMICOLON just like ,COMMA in the 1920s ,COMMA there was a peak coal ;SEMICOLON and a hundred years before that ,COMMA there was a peak wood .PERIOD 
this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .PERIOD 
and what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear ,COMMA for starters .PERIOD 
and what goes on in the future ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas ,COMMA and beyond that ,COMMA peak renewables .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'll tell you another little ,COMMA very important story about this picture .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing ,COMMA it is -- that's another part of the story .PERIOD come talk to me about it ,COMMA we'll fill in some of the details -- but there's a very important message here :COLON this is <NUM> years of history ,COMMA and for <NUM> years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system .PERIOD 
energy systems of the world becoming progressively -- year on year ,COMMA decade on decade ,COMMA century on century -- becoming less carbon intense .PERIOD 
now that might be the end of the story -- okay ,COMMA we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but i think ,COMMA actually ,COMMA there's more to the story than that .PERIOD 
and to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say <NUM> and beyond .PERIOD 
what is the future of truly sustainable ,COMMA carbon-free energy ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA we have to take a little excursion ,COMMA and we'll start in central texas .PERIOD 
here's a piece of limestone .PERIOD 
it's about <NUM> million years old .PERIOD 
and it's just limestone ,COMMA nothing really special about it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA here's a piece of chalk .PERIOD 
i picked this up at mit .PERIOD it's a little younger .PERIOD 
you wouldn't build a building out of this stuff ,COMMA and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA it's very different -- no ,COMMA it's not different .PERIOD 
it's not different ,COMMA it's the same stuff :COLON calcium carbonate ,COMMA calcium carbonate .PERIOD 
what's different is how the molecules are put together .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you think that's kind of neat ,COMMA the story gets really neat right now .PERIOD 
off the coast of california comes this :COLON it's an abalone shell .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA just in case you weren't already guessing ,COMMA it's calcium carbonate .PERIOD 
but it's not the same stuff ;SEMICOLON it's different .PERIOD 
it's thousands of times ,COMMA maybe <NUM> times tougher than this .PERIOD 
this is pretty incredible stuff .PERIOD 
all the same ,COMMA what's different ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA what does this have to do with energy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers ,COMMA or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells ,COMMA nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn't need to .PERIOD 
nature didn't need to because ,COMMA unlike the abalone shell ,COMMA the survival of a species didn't depend on building those materials ,COMMA until maybe now when it might just matter .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when we think about the future of energy ,COMMA imagine what would it be like if instead of this ,COMMA we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently .PERIOD 
and so that is my story .PERIOD 
the oil will never run out .PERIOD 
it's not because we have a lot of it .PERIOD 
it's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills .PERIOD 
it's because ,COMMA well ,COMMA thousands of years ago ,COMMA people invented ideas -- they had ideas ,COMMA innovations ,COMMA technology -- and the stone age ended ,COMMA not because we ran out of stones .PERIOD 
it's ideas ,COMMA it's innovation ,COMMA it's technology that will end the age of oil ,COMMA long before we run out of oil .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i am going to speak about corruption ,COMMA but i would like to juxtapose two different things .PERIOD 
one is the large global economy ,COMMA the large globalized economy ,COMMA and the other one is the small ,COMMA and very limited ,COMMA capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern ,COMMA to shape ,COMMA this economy .PERIOD 
because there is this asymmetry ,COMMA which creates ,COMMA basically ,COMMA failing governance .PERIOD 
failing governance in many areas :COLON in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment ,COMMA in the area of exploitation of women and children ,COMMA in the area of climate change ,COMMA in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy ,COMMA which is operating in a worldwide arena .PERIOD 
and i think corruption ,COMMA and the fight against corruption ,COMMA and the impact of corruption ,COMMA is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what i mean with this failure of governance .PERIOD 
let me talk about my own experience .PERIOD 
i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa .PERIOD 
at that time ,COMMA i noticed that corruption ,COMMA that grand corruption ,COMMA that systematic corruption ,COMMA was undermining everything we were trying to do .PERIOD 
and therefore ,COMMA i began to not only try to protect the work of the world bank ,COMMA our own projects ,COMMA our own programs against corruption ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA we need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption .PERIOD 
and as soon as i started this work ,COMMA i received a memorandum from the world bank ,COMMA from the legal department first ,COMMA in which they said ,COMMA you are not allowed to do this .PERIOD 
you are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries .PERIOD 
this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank ,COMMA so i want you to stop your doings .PERIOD 
in the meantime ,COMMA i was chairing donor meetings ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA in which the various donors ,COMMA and many of them like to be in nairobi -- it is true ,COMMA it is one of the unsafest cities of the world ,COMMA but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable .PERIOD 
and in these donor meetings ,COMMA i noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients ,COMMA by the governments ,COMMA by promoters ,COMMA many of them representing suppliers from the north -- that the worst projects were realized first .PERIOD 
let me give you an example :COLON a huge power project ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable ,COMMA and one of the most beautiful ,COMMA areas of western kenya .PERIOD 
and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits :COLON it had no clients ,COMMA nobody would buy the electricity there ,COMMA nobody was interested in irrigation projects .PERIOD 
to the contrary ,COMMA we knew that this project would destroy the environment :COLON it would destroy riparian forests ,COMMA which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups ,COMMA the samburu and the turkana in this area .PERIOD 
so everybody knew this is a ,COMMA not a useless project ,COMMA this is an absolute damaging ,COMMA a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars ,COMMA and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools ,COMMA like hospitals and so on .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA we all rejected this project ,COMMA none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it ,COMMA and it was the first project to be implemented .PERIOD 
the good projects ,COMMA which we as a donor community would take under our wings ,COMMA they took years ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you had too many studies ,COMMA and very often they didn't succeed .PERIOD 
but these bad projects ,COMMA which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy for many generations ,COMMA for the environment ,COMMA for thousands of families who had to be resettled -- they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks ,COMMA of supplier agencies ,COMMA of insurance agencies -- like in germany ,COMMA hermes ,COMMA and so on -- and they came back very ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA these suppliers were our big companies .PERIOD 
they were the actors of this global market ,COMMA which i mentioned in the beginning .PERIOD 
they were the siemenses of this world ,COMMA coming from france ,COMMA from the uk ,COMMA from japan ,COMMA from canada ,COMMA from germany ,COMMA and they were systematically driven by systematic ,COMMA large-scale corruption .PERIOD 
we are not talking about <NUM> dollars here ,COMMA or <NUM> dollars there ,COMMA or one million dollars there .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we are talking about <NUM> million ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars on the swiss bank accounts ,COMMA on the bank accounts of liechtenstein ,COMMA of the president's ministers ,COMMA the high officials in the para-statal sectors .PERIOD 
this was the reality which i saw ,COMMA and not only one project like that :COLON i saw ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA over the years i worked in africa ,COMMA i saw hundreds of projects like this .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries ,COMMA which is the main reason for the misery ,COMMA for the poverty ,COMMA for the conflicts ,COMMA for the violence ,COMMA for the desperation in many of these countries .PERIOD 
that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line ,COMMA that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world ,COMMA twice that number ,COMMA more than two billion people without sanitation and so on ,COMMA and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children ,COMMA still ,COMMA child mortality of more than <NUM> million people every year ,COMMA children dying before they are five years old :COLON the cause of this is ,COMMA to a large extent ,COMMA grand corruption .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why did the world bank not let me do this work ?QUESTIONMARK 
i found out afterwards ,COMMA after i left ,COMMA under a big fight ,COMMA the world bank .PERIOD 
the reason was that the members of the world bank thought that foreign bribery was okay ,COMMA including germany .PERIOD 
in germany ,COMMA foreign bribery was allowed .PERIOD 
it was even tax-deductible .PERIOD 
not all of them ,COMMA but most of them .PERIOD 
and this is the phenomenon which i call failing governance ,COMMA because when i then came to germany and started this little ngo here in berlin ,COMMA at the villa borsig ,COMMA we were told ,COMMA you cannot stop our german exporters from bribing ,COMMA because we will lose our contracts .PERIOD 
we will lose to the french ,COMMA we will lose to the swedes ,COMMA we'll lose to the japanese .PERIOD 
and therefore ,COMMA there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma ,COMMA which made it very difficult for an individual company ,COMMA an individual exporting country to say ,COMMA we are not going to continue this deadly ,COMMA disastrous habit of large companies to bribe .PERIOD 
so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure ,COMMA because even the powerful government ,COMMA which we have in germany ,COMMA comparatively ,COMMA was not able to say ,COMMA we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad .PERIOD 
they needed help ,COMMA and the large companies themselves have this dilemma .PERIOD 
many of them didn't want to bribe .PERIOD 
many of the german companies ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price ,COMMA so they are very competitive .PERIOD 
and this is why i'm telling you this :COLON civil society rose to the occasion .PERIOD 
we had this small ngo ,COMMA transparency international .PERIOD 
they began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma ,COMMA and we developed concepts of collective action ,COMMA basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table ,COMMA explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing ,COMMA and to make a long story short ,COMMA we managed to eventually get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA a convention ,COMMA under the auspices of the oecd ,COMMA which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it's interesting ,COMMA in doing this ,COMMA we had to sit together with the companies .PERIOD 
we had here in berlin ,COMMA at the aspen institute on the wannsee ,COMMA we had sessions with about <NUM> captains of industry ,COMMA and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery .PERIOD 
and president von weizsäcker ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA chaired one of the sessions ,COMMA the first one ,COMMA to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs ,COMMA who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations .PERIOD 
and in the first session ,COMMA they all said ,COMMA this is not bribery ,COMMA what we are doing .PERIOD this is customary there .PERIOD 
this is what these other cultures demand .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA [unclear] still says this today .PERIOD 
and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing .PERIOD 
but in the second session ,COMMA they admitted already that they would never do this ,COMMA what they are doing in these other countries ,COMMA here in germany ,COMMA or in the uk ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
cabinet ministers would admit this .PERIOD 
and in the final session ,COMMA at the aspen institute ,COMMA we had them all sign an open letter to the kohl government ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA requesting that they participate in the oecd convention .PERIOD 
and this is ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA an example of soft power ,COMMA because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us .PERIOD 
we had a longer-term time perspective .PERIOD 
we had a broader ,COMMA geographically much wider ,COMMA constituency we were trying to defend .PERIOD 
and that's why the law has changed .PERIOD 
that's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why min is in the trouble they are in .PERIOD 
in some other countries ,COMMA the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA again ,COMMA civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment .PERIOD 
in london ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA where the bae got away with a huge corruption case ,COMMA which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute ,COMMA <NUM> million british pounds ,COMMA every year for ten years ,COMMA to one particular official of one particular friendly country ,COMMA who then bought for <NUM> billion pounds of military equipment .PERIOD 
this case ,COMMA they are not prosecuting in the uk .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain .PERIOD 
civil society is pushing ,COMMA civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem ,COMMA also in the uk ,COMMA and also in japan ,COMMA which is not properly enforcing ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
in germany ,COMMA we are pushing the ratification of the un convention ,COMMA which is a subsequent convention .PERIOD 
we are ,COMMA germany ,COMMA is not ratifying .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies .PERIOD 
in germany ,COMMA we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant ,COMMA but you are allowed to bribe a deputy .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA under german law ,COMMA allowed ,COMMA and the members of our parliament don't want to change this ,COMMA and this is why they can't sign the un .PERIOD convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very ,COMMA very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world ,COMMA but not able to ratify the convention ,COMMA which we managed to get on the books with about <NUM> countries all over the world .PERIOD 
i see my time is ticking .PERIOD 
let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened .PERIOD 
i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption ,COMMA one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance .PERIOD 
by now ,COMMA the united nations is totally on our side .PERIOD 
most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on .PERIOD 
and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem ,COMMA in the development of remedies ,COMMA in the implementation of reforms ,COMMA and then later ,COMMA in the monitoring of reforms .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA if civil society organizations want to play that role ,COMMA they have to grow into this responsibility .PERIOD 
not all civil society organizations are good .PERIOD 
the ku klux klan is an ngo .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself .PERIOD 
they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations .PERIOD 
we also need much more competence of civil society leaders .PERIOD 
this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin ,COMMA because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general ,COMMA do not focus enough ,COMMA yet ,COMMA on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society .PERIOD 
but what i'm saying from my very practical experience :COLON if civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular ,COMMA governments ,COMMA governments and their international institutions ,COMMA but also large international actors ,COMMA in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society ,COMMA government and private sector ,COMMA there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
the national portrait gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great american lives ,COMMA amazing people .PERIOD 
and so i'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about a program i started there ,COMMA which ,COMMA from my point of view ,COMMA is the proudest thing i did .PERIOD 
i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore ,COMMA and they're amazing people ,COMMA and we want to deliver them to future generations .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how do we do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series .PERIOD 
and the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .PERIOD 
and so what i'm going to do is ,COMMA not so much give you the great hits of that program ,COMMA as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation ,COMMA what you try to find out about them ,COMMA and when people deliver and when they don't and why .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i had two preconditions .PERIOD 
one was that they be american .PERIOD 
that's just because ,COMMA in the nature of the national portrait gallery ,COMMA it's created to look at american lives .PERIOD 
that was easy ,COMMA but then i made the decision ,COMMA maybe arbitrary ,COMMA that they needed to be people of a certain age ,COMMA which at that point ,COMMA when i created this program ,COMMA seemed really old .PERIOD 
sixties ,COMMA seventies ,COMMA eighties and nineties .PERIOD 
for obvious reasons ,COMMA it doesn't seem that old anymore to me .PERIOD 
and why did i do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA for one thing ,COMMA we're a youth-obsessed culture .PERIOD 
but the second part of it -- and the older i get ,COMMA the more convinced i am that that's true .PERIOD 
it's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out .PERIOD 
that's the one advantage that older people have .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA they have other ,COMMA little bit of advantage ,COMMA but they also have some disadvantages ,COMMA but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we can then go back in our lives ,COMMA if we've got an interviewer who gets that ,COMMA and begin to reflect on how we got there .PERIOD 
all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i thought okay ,COMMA now ,COMMA what is it going to take to make this work ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are many kinds of interviews .PERIOD we know them .PERIOD 
there are the journalist interviews ,COMMA which are the interrogation that is expected .PERIOD 
this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee .PERIOD 
then there's the celebrity interview ,COMMA where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers .PERIOD 
that's frost-nixon ,COMMA where frost seems to be as important as nixon in that process .PERIOD 
fair enough .PERIOD 
but i wanted interviews that were different .PERIOD 
i wanted to be ,COMMA as i later thought of it ,COMMA empathic ,COMMA which is to say ,COMMA to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA this was always done in public .PERIOD 
this was not an oral history program .PERIOD 
this was all about <NUM> people sitting at the feet of this individual ,COMMA and having me be the brush in their self-portrait .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it turns out that i was pretty good at that .PERIOD 
i didn't know it coming into it .PERIOD 
and the only reason i really know that is because of one interview i did with senator william fulbright ,COMMA and that was six months after he'd had a stroke .PERIOD 
this was not a devastating stroke ,COMMA but it did affect his speaking and so forth .PERIOD 
and i thought it was worth a chance ,COMMA he thought it was worth a chance ,COMMA and so we got up on the stage ,COMMA and we had an hour conversation about his life ,COMMA and after that a woman rushed up to me ,COMMA essentially did ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA where did you train as a doctor ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA i have no training as a doctor .PERIOD i never claimed that .PERIOD 
when he started a sentence ,COMMA particularly in the early parts of the interview ,COMMA and paused ,COMMA you gave him the word ,COMMA the bridge to get to the end of the sentence ,COMMA and by the end of it ,COMMA he was speaking complete sentences on his own .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA fine ,COMMA i've got empathy ,COMMA or empathy ,COMMA at any rate ,COMMA is what's critical to this kind of interview .PERIOD 
but then i began to think of other things .PERIOD 
who makes a great interview in this context ?QUESTIONMARK 
it had nothing to do with their intellect ,COMMA the quality of their intellect .PERIOD 
some of them were very brilliant ,COMMA some of them were ,COMMA you know ,COMMA ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals ,COMMA but it was never about that .PERIOD 
it was about their energy .PERIOD 
it's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives .PERIOD 
i'm convinced of it .PERIOD 
and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the first person i interviewed was george abbott ,COMMA who was <NUM> ,COMMA and abbott was filled with the life force -- i guess that's the way i think about it -- filled with it .PERIOD 
and so he filled the room ,COMMA and we had an extraordinary conversation .PERIOD 
he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent ,COMMA for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA he did wind up opening up -- by the way ,COMMA his energy is evidenced in other ways .PERIOD 
he subsequently got married again at <NUM> ,COMMA so he ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he had a lot of the life force in him .PERIOD 
i didn't know who she was ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA did you get george abbott to talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD apparently i did .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA i'm his old girlfriend ,COMMA maureen stapleton ,COMMA and i could never do it .PERIOD 
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you want energy ,COMMA you want the life force ,COMMA but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing .PERIOD 
the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest .PERIOD 
there's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them .PERIOD 
the journalist who did the rise and fall of the third reich .PERIOD 
this guy had met hitler and gandhi within six months ,COMMA and every time i'd ask him about it ,COMMA he'd say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i just happened to be there .PERIOD 
didn't matter .PERIOD whatever .PERIOD 
awful .PERIOD 
i never would ever agree to interview a modest person .PERIOD 
they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you .PERIOD 
but it comes down ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA to how do you get through all the barriers we have .PERIOD 
all of us are public and private beings ,COMMA and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self ,COMMA there's no point in it .PERIOD 
it's pre-programmed .PERIOD it's infomercial ,COMMA and we all have infomercials about our lives .PERIOD 
we know the great lines ,COMMA we know the great moments ,COMMA we know what we're not going to share ,COMMA and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody .PERIOD 
this wasn't -- and some of you will remember mike wallace's old interviews -- tough ,COMMA aggressive and so forth .PERIOD they have their place .PERIOD 
i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say ,COMMA to break out of their own cocoon of the public self ,COMMA and the more public they had been ,COMMA the more entrenched that person ,COMMA that outer person was .PERIOD 
and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series .PERIOD 
it all has to do with that shell that most of us have ,COMMA and particularly certain people .PERIOD 
there's an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce .PERIOD 
it'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you .PERIOD 
she did so much .PERIOD she was a playwright .PERIOD 
she did an extraordinary play called the women .PERIOD 
she was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen .PERIOD 
she was editor of vanity fair ,COMMA one of the great phenomenal women of her day .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right .PERIOD 
she was sort of adored on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA when we did the interview -- i did the living self-portrait with her -- there were three former directors of the cia basically sitting at her feet ,COMMA just enjoying her presence .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA this is going to be a piece of cake ,COMMA because i always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe <NUM> or <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
we never talk before that because if you talk before ,COMMA you don't get it on the stage .PERIOD 
so she and i had a delightful conversation .PERIOD 
we were on the stage and then -- by the way ,COMMA spectacular .PERIOD 
it was all part of clare boothe luce's look .PERIOD 
she was in a great evening gown .PERIOD 
she was <NUM> ,COMMA almost that day of the interview ,COMMA and there she was and there i was ,COMMA and i just proceeded into the questions .PERIOD 
anything that i would ask ,COMMA she would turn around ,COMMA dismiss ,COMMA and i was basically up there -- any of you in the moderate-to-full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage .PERIOD 
and i was dying .PERIOD she was absolutely not giving me a thing .PERIOD 
and i began to wonder what was going on ,COMMA and you think while you talk ,COMMA and basically ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA i got it .PERIOD 
when we were alone ,COMMA i was her audience .PERIOD 
now i'm her competitor for the audience .PERIOD 
most people think that i was an actress .PERIOD i was never an actress .PERIOD 
but i hadn't asked that ,COMMA and then she went off on a tear ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA there was that one time that i was an actress .PERIOD 
it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman ,COMMA and i got up there ,COMMA and she went on and on ,COMMA and then i got on the stage .PERIOD 
and then she turned to me and said ,COMMA and you know what those young actors did ?QUESTIONMARK 
they upstaged me .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA do you know what that is ?QUESTIONMARK 
just withering in her contempt .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA i'm learning .PERIOD 
and she looked at me ,COMMA and it was like the successful arm-wrestle ,COMMA and then ,COMMA after that ,COMMA she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like .PERIOD 
i have to end that one .PERIOD this is my tribute to clare boothe luce .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA a remarkable person .PERIOD 
i'm not politically attracted to her ,COMMA but through her life force ,COMMA i'm attracted to her .PERIOD 
and the way she died -- she had ,COMMA toward the end ,COMMA a brain tumor .PERIOD 
that's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine ,COMMA and very few of us were invited to a dinner party .PERIOD 
and she was in horrible pain .PERIOD 
we all knew that .PERIOD 
she stayed in her room .PERIOD 
everybody came .PERIOD the butler passed around canapes .PERIOD 
the usual sort of thing .PERIOD 
then at a certain moment ,COMMA the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed ,COMMA completely composed .PERIOD 
the public self ,COMMA the beauty ,COMMA the intellect ,COMMA and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there are other ways that you get somebody to open up ,COMMA and this is just a brief reference .PERIOD 
it wasn't this arm-wrestle ,COMMA but it was a little surprising for the person involved .PERIOD 
i interviewed steve martin .PERIOD it wasn't all that long ago .PERIOD 
and we were sitting there ,COMMA and almost toward the beginning of the interview ,COMMA i turned to him and i said ,COMMA steve ,COMMA or mr .PERIOD martin ,COMMA it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods .PERIOD 
was yours unhappy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he looked at me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as if to say ,COMMA this is how you're going to start this thing ,COMMA right off ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then he turned to me ,COMMA not stupidly ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA what was your childhood like ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said -- these are all arm wrestles ,COMMA but they're affectionate -- and i said ,COMMA my father was loving and supportive ,COMMA which is why i'm not funny .PERIOD 
and he looked at me ,COMMA and then we heard the big sad story .PERIOD 
so the question is :COLON what is the key that's going to allow this to proceed ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA these are arm wrestle questions ,COMMA but i want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really ,COMMA very often ,COMMA are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked .PERIOD 
and i'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints .PERIOD 
one was an interview i did with one of the great american biographers .PERIOD 
he did a five-volume biography of thomas jefferson ,COMMA spent virtually his whole life with thomas jefferson ,COMMA and by the way ,COMMA at one point i asked him ,COMMA would you like to have met him ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA i know him better than anyone who ever met him ,COMMA because i got to read all of his letters .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and i asked him one question .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA did jefferson ever disappoint you ?QUESTIONMARK 
dumas malone was from mississippi originally .PERIOD 
but he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA he said ,COMMA i'm afraid so .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i've read everything ,COMMA and sometimes mr .PERIOD jefferson would smooth the truth a bit .PERIOD 
and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had ,COMMA because he saw the letters .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA but i understand that .PERIOD he said ,COMMA i understand that .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA we southerners do like a smooth surface ,COMMA so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA now ,COMMA john adams was too honest .PERIOD 
and he started to talk about that ,COMMA and later on he invited me to his house ,COMMA and i met his wife who was from massachusetts ,COMMA and he and she had exactly the relationship of thomas jefferson and john adams .PERIOD 
she was the new englander and abrasive ,COMMA and he was this courtly fellow .PERIOD 
but really the most important question i ever asked ,COMMA and most of the times when i talk about it ,COMMA people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity ,COMMA or cruelty ,COMMA but i promise you it was the right question .PERIOD 
this was to agnes de mille .PERIOD 
agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history .PERIOD 
she basically created the dances in oklahoma ,COMMA transforming the american theater .PERIOD 
an amazing woman .PERIOD 
at the time that i proposed to her that -- by the way ,COMMA i would have proposed to her ;SEMICOLON she was extraordinary -- but proposed to her that she come on .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA come to my apartment .PERIOD 
she lived in new york .PERIOD 
come to my apartment and we'll talk for those <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and then we'll decide whether we proceed .PERIOD 
and so i showed up in this dark ,COMMA rambling new york apartment ,COMMA and she called out to me ,COMMA and she was in bed .PERIOD 
i had known that she had had a stroke ,COMMA and that was some <NUM> years before .PERIOD 
and so she spent almost all of her life in bed ,COMMA but -- i speak of the life force -- her hair was askew .PERIOD 
she wasn't about to make up for this occasion .PERIOD 
and she was sitting there surrounded by books ,COMMA and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will ,COMMA which she had by her side .PERIOD 
she wasn't unhappy about this .PERIOD she was resigned .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA i keep this will by my bed ,COMMA memento mori ,COMMA and i change it all the time just because i want to .PERIOD 
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA this is somebody i've got to get in this series .PERIOD 
she agreed .PERIOD 
she came on .PERIOD of course she was wheelchaired on .PERIOD 
half of her body was stricken ,COMMA the other half not .PERIOD 
she was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA done up for the occasion ,COMMA but this was a woman in great physical distress .PERIOD 
and we had a conversation ,COMMA and then i asked her this unthinkable question .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the audience just -- you know ,COMMA they're always on the side of the interviewee ,COMMA and they felt that this was a kind of assault ,COMMA but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life .PERIOD 
and she began to talk about her childhood ,COMMA when she was beautiful ,COMMA and she literally turned -- here she was ,COMMA in this broken body -- and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth ,COMMA and then she said ,COMMA and then puberty hit .PERIOD 
and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face ,COMMA and how she could no longer count on her beauty ,COMMA and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given .PERIOD 
and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company ,COMMA and in that process ,COMMA she made a number of decisions .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA was that dance ,COMMA even though it hadn't been offered to her ,COMMA was her life .PERIOD 
and secondly ,COMMA she had better be ,COMMA although she did dance for a while ,COMMA a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter .PERIOD 
but she was thrilled to get that out as a real ,COMMA real fact in her life .PERIOD 
it was an amazing privilege to do this series .PERIOD 
there were other moments like that ,COMMA very few moments of silence .PERIOD 
the key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions ,COMMA so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are ,COMMA and i commend that to you ,COMMA even if you're not doing interviews .PERIOD 
just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
it is a story of hope ,COMMA resilience and glamour .PERIOD 
there was hollywood .PERIOD 
then came bollywood .PERIOD 
today we have nollywood ,COMMA the third-largest film industry in the world .PERIOD 
in <NUM> alone ,COMMA almost <NUM> films were made in nigeria .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA try to imagine <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> films wrapped ,COMMA distributed ,COMMA every week in the streets of lagos ,COMMA nigeria and west africa .PERIOD 
some estimates put the value of this industry at <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
it has created thousands ,COMMA if not tens of thousands of jobs .PERIOD 
and it's expanding .PERIOD 
but keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement .PERIOD 
this is something that happened without foreign investment ,COMMA without government aid ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA it happened against all odds ,COMMA in one of the most difficult moments in nigerian economy .PERIOD 
the industry is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words ,COMMA a few things about my personal life ,COMMA because i think there is a connection .PERIOD 
my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia .PERIOD 
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .PERIOD 
even though i left when i was only three years old ,COMMA i really felt that africa was this big part of my life .PERIOD 
and it really was a place where i learned to walk .PERIOD 
i think i uttered the first words ,COMMA and my family bought their first home .PERIOD 
so when we came back to italy ,COMMA and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories .PERIOD 
it seemed that for our neighbors and friends ,COMMA africa was either this exotic place ,COMMA this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination ,COMMA or the place of horror ,COMMA famine .PERIOD 
and so we were always caught in this stereotype .PERIOD 
and i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives ,COMMA and have dreams like we all have .PERIOD 
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nollywood ,COMMA i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions .PERIOD 
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do ,COMMA and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .PERIOD 
and we really look how digital technology is changing ,COMMA and how young ,COMMA independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost .PERIOD 
so when i proposed the story ,COMMA i really had all the support to make this film .PERIOD 
and not only had the support ,COMMA i found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure .PERIOD 
aimee corrigan ,COMMA a very talented and young photographer ,COMMA and robert caputo ,COMMA a friend and a mentor ,COMMA who is a veteran of national geographic ,COMMA and told me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA franco ,COMMA in <NUM> years of covering africa ,COMMA i don't know if i have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun .PERIOD 
so we went to lagos in october <NUM> .PERIOD 
and we went to lagos to meet bond emeruwa ,COMMA a wonderful ,COMMA talented film director who is with us tonight .PERIOD 
the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood ,COMMA of this incredible film industry ,COMMA following bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption ,COMMA called checkpoint .PERIOD 
police corruption .PERIOD 
and he had nine days to make it .PERIOD 
we thought this was a good story .PERIOD 
in the meantime ,COMMA we had to cover nollywood ,COMMA and we talked to a lot of filmmakers .PERIOD 
but i don't want to create too many expectations .PERIOD 
i would like to show you six minutes .PERIOD 
and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience .PERIOD 
so i guess it's a world premier .PERIOD 
man :COLON action .PERIOD 
and you shoot in seven days .PERIOD 
peace piberesima :COLON we're doing films for the masses .PERIOD 
we're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses .PERIOD 
mahmood ali balogun :COLON i think filmmaking in nigeria ,COMMA for those who work in it ,COMMA is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living .PERIOD 
it's not the fancy filmmaking where you say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you want to put all the razzmatazz of hollywood ,COMMA and where you have big budgets .PERIOD 
here is that you make these films ,COMMA it sells ,COMMA you jump onto the location again to make another film ,COMMA because if you don't make the next film ,COMMA you're not going to feed .PERIOD 
bond emeruwa :COLON so while we're entertaining ,COMMA we should be able to educate .PERIOD 
i believe in the power of audiovisuals .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the population will watch nollywood .PERIOD 
i think it's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable .PERIOD 
so if you're making a movie ,COMMA no matter what your topic is ,COMMA put in a message in there .PERIOD 
woman :COLON you still have to report the incident .PERIOD 
he needs proper medical attention .PERIOD 
i keep trying to explain to people ,COMMA it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA there are those films that people are making for quality ,COMMA but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day ,COMMA and these are the people that really watch these films .PERIOD 
sonny mcdon w :COLON nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world .PERIOD 
lancelot imasen :COLON but our films ,COMMA they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .PERIOD 
they are stories about our people ,COMMA for our people .PERIOD 
and consistently ,COMMA they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story .PERIOD 
you'll crack your ribs .PERIOD 
bernard pinayon agbaosi :COLON we have been so deep into the foreign movies .PERIOD 
it's all about the foreign movies .PERIOD 
but we can do something too .PERIOD 
we can do something ,COMMA something that when the world sees it ,COMMA they say ,COMMA wow ,COMMA this is nigeria .PERIOD 
man :COLON just arrest yourself ,COMMA sergeant .PERIOD 
don't embarrass yourself .PERIOD 
come on .PERIOD don't run away .PERIOD come back .PERIOD come back .PERIOD 
smw :COLON you can now walk the street and see a role model .PERIOD 
it’s not just what you see in picture .PERIOD 
you see the person live .PERIOD 
you see how he talks .PERIOD you see how he lives .PERIOD 
he influences you really good ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
it’s not just what you see in the picture .PERIOD 
man :COLON see you .PERIOD bye .PERIOD 
action .PERIOD 
saint obi :COLON i was so fascinated ,COMMA you know ,COMMA with those cowboy movies .PERIOD 
but then when i discovered the situation in my country ,COMMA at that time there was so much corruption .PERIOD 
for a young man to really make it out here ,COMMA you got to think of some negative things and all that ,COMMA or some kind of vices .PERIOD 
and i didn't want that ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor ,COMMA without doing crime ,COMMA without cheating nobody ,COMMA without telling no lies .PERIOD 
just me and god-given talent .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA it's time to kick some ass .PERIOD 
cover this .PERIOD it's your own .PERIOD 
move it .PERIOD 
roboger animadu :COLON in big countries ,COMMA when they do the movies ,COMMA they have all these things in place .PERIOD 
but here ,COMMA we improvise these items ,COMMA like the gunshots .PERIOD 
woman :COLON that's why i use enough masking tape .PERIOD 
the masking tape will hold it .PERIOD 
wat ,COMMA wait .PERIOD just hold this for me .PERIOD 
kbi :COLON i'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
but she's a professional .PERIOD she knows what she’s doing .PERIOD 
i'm trying to protect my face too .PERIOD 
this ain't going to be my last movie .PERIOD 
so now you're about to see how we do our own movies here ,COMMA with or without any assistance from anybody .PERIOD 
man :COLON action .PERIOD 
cut .PERIOD 
franco sacchi :COLON so many things to say ,COMMA so little time .PERIOD 
so many themes in this story .PERIOD 
i just can't tell you -- there’s one thing i want to tell you .PERIOD 
i spent ,COMMA you know ,COMMA several weeks with all these actors ,COMMA producers ,COMMA and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a westerner ,COMMA a filmmaker who works in america or in europe .PERIOD 
werner herzog ,COMMA the german filmmaker said ,COMMA i need to make movies like you need oxygen .PERIOD 
and i think they’re breathing .PERIOD 
a woman told me ,COMMA when i see a nollywood film ,COMMA i can relax ,COMMA i really -- i can breathe better .PERIOD 
there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience .PERIOD 
it’s technology .PERIOD i’m very interested in it and i really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be .PERIOD 
incredible cameras cost under <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
and this has unleashed tremendous energy .PERIOD 
and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK 
we didn’t have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers .PERIOD 
they understood it ,COMMA they embraced the technology and they run with it ,COMMA and they’re successful .PERIOD 
i hope that the nollywood phenomenon will go both ways .PERIOD 
i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology ,COMMA look at the nigerian model ,COMMA make their films ,COMMA create jobs ,COMMA create a narrative for the population ,COMMA something to identify ,COMMA something positive ,COMMA something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture .PERIOD 
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .PERIOD 
i really think it goes both ways .PERIOD 
so i really think it’s a lesson that we're actually learning from them .PERIOD 
and there's one thing ,COMMA one small challenge that i have for you ,COMMA and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling .PERIOD 
and i think this is really the theme of this session .PERIOD 
try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter ,COMMA but no stories .PERIOD 
no legends ,COMMA no fairytales .PERIOD 
nothing .PERIOD 
no novels .PERIOD 
so this is what i really think .PERIOD 
i would like you to hear their voices .PERIOD 
just a few moments .PERIOD 
toyin alousa :COLON nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them .PERIOD 
if you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face ,COMMA that’s nollywood .PERIOD 
i believe very soon ,COMMA we’re not only going to have better movies ,COMMA we'll have that original nigerian movie .PERIOD 
it’s still the same basic themes .PERIOD 
love ,COMMA action .PERIOD 
but we're telling it our own way ,COMMA our own nigerian way ,COMMA african way .PERIOD 
we have diverse cultures ,COMMA diverse cultures ,COMMA there are so many ,COMMA that in the natal lifetimes ,COMMA i don't see us exhausting the stories we have .PERIOD 
my job ends here ,COMMA and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to work .PERIOD 
and i really hope that there will be many ,COMMA many collaborations ,COMMA where we teach each other things .PERIOD 
and i really hope that this will happen .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON stop .PERIOD i've got two questions .PERIOD 
franco ,COMMA you described this as the world's third largest film industry .PERIOD 
what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films ,COMMA really ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh ,COMMA yes .PERIOD i think i mentioned briefly -- it's close to <NUM> films .PERIOD 
there is scientific data on this .PERIOD 
<NUM> films a year ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> films a year .PERIOD <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA the censor board has censored <NUM> films alone .PERIOD 
so it’s safe to say that there are <NUM> films .PERIOD 
so imagine <NUM> films per week .PERIOD 
there are challenges .PERIOD there are challenges .PERIOD 
there is a glut of film ,COMMA the quality has to be raised ,COMMA they need to go to the next level ,COMMA but i’m optimistic .PERIOD 
and these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh yes ,COMMA of course .PERIOD this is very important .PERIOD 
maybe ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for you to try to imagine this ,COMMA these are films that are distributed directly in markets .PERIOD 
they are bought in video shops .PERIOD 
on what format ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh ,COMMA the format -- thank you for the question .PERIOD yes ,COMMA it's vcds .PERIOD 
it's a cd ,COMMA it's a little bit more compressed image .PERIOD 
they started with vhs .PERIOD 
they actually didn't wait for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the latest technology .PERIOD 
they started in '<NUM> ,COMMA '<NUM> .PERIOD 
so there are <NUM> million vcrs in nigeria that play ,COMMA you know ,COMMA vhs and these vcds .PERIOD 
it's a cd basically .PERIOD it's a compact disc .PERIOD 
so on the streets ,COMMA are film casts . .PERIOD ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i have to say ,COMMA this really proves that storytelling ,COMMA it's a commodity ,COMMA it's a staple .PERIOD 
there is no life without stories .PERIOD 
franco ,COMMA thank you so much .PERIOD 
i'm going to go right into the slides .PERIOD 
and all i'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff .PERIOD 
and my ideas are -- in my head ,COMMA anyway -- they're very logical and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients .PERIOD 
i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems ,COMMA or i really do solve their problems ,COMMA because usually they seem to like it .PERIOD 
let me go right into the slides .PERIOD 
can you turn off the light ?QUESTIONMARK down .PERIOD 
i like to be in the dark .PERIOD 
i don't want you to see what i'm doing up here .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA i did this house in santa monica ,COMMA and it got a lot of notoriety .PERIOD 
this is in venice .PERIOD 
i just show it because i want you to know i'm concerned about context .PERIOD 
when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird ,COMMA and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they're photographed or seen in that space .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA once i deal with the context ,COMMA i then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene ,COMMA as i hope you'll find that slide on the right .PERIOD 
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .PERIOD 
and we continue to work with this client .PERIOD 
the building on the right at the top is now under construction .PERIOD 
the garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down ,COMMA finally ,COMMA and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we've created ,COMMA this campus .PERIOD 
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place .PERIOD 
they wanted a sense of place .PERIOD 
and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown ,COMMA in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .PERIOD 
i tried to be inclusive ,COMMA to include the buildings in the neighborhood ,COMMA whether they were buildings i liked or not .PERIOD 
in the '60s i started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale's .PERIOD 
we even made flooring ,COMMA walls and everything ,COMMA out of cardboard .PERIOD 
and the success of it threw me for a loop .PERIOD 
i couldn't deal with the success of furniture -- i wasn't secure enough as an architect -- and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA nobody would like this .PERIOD 
and it was in this ,COMMA preliminary to these pieces of furniture ,COMMA that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice .PERIOD 
and after we failed ,COMMA i just kept failing .PERIOD 
the piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket .PERIOD 
and i put a piece of tape around it ,COMMA as you see there ,COMMA and realized you could sit on it ,COMMA and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it was an accidental discovery .PERIOD 
i got into fish .PERIOD 
and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement .PERIOD 
and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental ,COMMA again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing ,COMMA and i just kept going with it ,COMMA and made this proposal for a building ,COMMA which was only a proposal .PERIOD 
i did this building in japan .PERIOD 
i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed .PERIOD 
and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff .PERIOD 
and after i got -- i was really drunk -- i was asked to do some sketches on napkins .PERIOD 
and i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and morandi-like things that i used to do .PERIOD 
and so i made a drawing with a fish ,COMMA and i left japan .PERIOD 
three weeks later ,COMMA i received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's hard to do .PERIOD it's hard to translate a fish form ,COMMA because they're so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this .PERIOD 
and oldenburg ,COMMA who i work with a little once in a while ,COMMA told me i couldn't do it ,COMMA and so that made it even more exciting .PERIOD 
but he was right -- i couldn't do the tail .PERIOD 
i started to get the head ok ,COMMA but the tail i couldn't do .PERIOD 
it was pretty hard .PERIOD 
the thing on the right is a snake form ,COMMA a ziggurat .PERIOD 
and i put them together ,COMMA and you walk between them .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record -- they didn't show the context ,COMMA so you would think ,COMMA god ,COMMA what a pushy guy this is .PERIOD 
but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant .PERIOD 
as for craft and technology and all those things that you've all been talking about ,COMMA i was thrown for a complete loop .PERIOD 
this was built in six months .PERIOD 
the way we sent drawings to japan :COLON we used the magic computer in michigan that does carved models ,COMMA and we used to make foam models ,COMMA which that thing scanned .PERIOD 
we made the drawings of the fish and the scales .PERIOD 
and when i got there ,COMMA everything was perfect -- except the tail .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i decided to cut off the head and the tail .PERIOD 
and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker .PERIOD 
and then jay chiat ,COMMA a friend and client ,COMMA asked me to do his headquarters building in la .PERIOD 
toxic waste ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA is the key clue to that one .PERIOD 
and so we built a temporary building -- i'm getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that's a fish .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA finally ,COMMA jay dragged me to my hometown ,COMMA toronto ,COMMA canada .PERIOD 
and there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday ,COMMA bringing it home ,COMMA putting it in the bathtub when i was a kid .PERIOD 
i played with it in the evening .PERIOD 
when i went to sleep ,COMMA the next day it wasn't there .PERIOD 
and the next night ,COMMA we had gefilte fish .PERIOD 
and so i set up this interior for jay's offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture .PERIOD 
and he didn't buy a sculpture ,COMMA so i made one .PERIOD 
it was a joke .PERIOD 
i play with funny people like [claes] oldenburg .PERIOD 
we've been friends for a long time .PERIOD 
a few years ago ,COMMA we did a performance piece in venice ,COMMA italy ,COMMA called il corso del coltello -- the swiss army knife .PERIOD 
and most of the imagery is -- claes' ,COMMA but those two little boys are my sons ,COMMA and they were claes' assistants in the play .PERIOD 
he was the swiss army knife .PERIOD 
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter ,COMMA and i was frankie p .PERIOD toronto .PERIOD 
p for palladio .PERIOD 
dressed up like the at&ampt building by claes -- with a fish hat .PERIOD 
this beautiful object ,COMMA the swiss army knife ,COMMA which i get credit for participating in .PERIOD 
and i can tell you -- it's totally an oldenburg .PERIOD 
i had nothing to do with it .PERIOD 
the only thing i did was ,COMMA i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal ,COMMA because i love sailing .PERIOD 
we made it into a sailing craft .PERIOD 
i've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing .PERIOD 
i do it because it's a curious thing in the culture ,COMMA when things are made in such great quantities ,COMMA absorbed in such great quantities ,COMMA and there's so much denial about them .PERIOD 
people hate it .PERIOD 
and i'm fascinated with that ,COMMA which ,COMMA like the paper furniture -- it's one of those materials .PERIOD 
and i'm always drawn to that .PERIOD 
but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school .PERIOD 
and that chain link is really expensive .PERIOD 
and then we did a camp together for children with cancer .PERIOD 
and you can see ,COMMA we started making a building together .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA the milk can is his .PERIOD 
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .PERIOD 
then jay chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in venice ,COMMA and i started with this three-piece thing ,COMMA and you entered in the middle .PERIOD 
and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle .PERIOD 
and one day i had a -- oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA the other way .PERIOD 
i had the binoculars from claes ,COMMA and i put them there ,COMMA and i could never get rid of them after that .PERIOD 
oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal .PERIOD 
it made my building look sick .PERIOD 
it led to the building on the left .PERIOD 
i use a lot of metal in my work ,COMMA and i have a hard time connecting with the craft .PERIOD 
the whole thing about my house ,COMMA the whole use of rough carpentry and everything ,COMMA was the frustration with the crafts available .PERIOD 
there were plenty of models for that ,COMMA in rauschenberg and jasper johns ,COMMA and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials .PERIOD 
i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture .PERIOD 
the metalworkers ,COMMA for the most part ,COMMA do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff .PERIOD 
and it's working very well to have these people ,COMMA these craftsmen ,COMMA interested in it .PERIOD 
i just tell the stories .PERIOD 
it's a way of connecting ,COMMA at least ,COMMA with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture .PERIOD 
the metal continued into a building -- herman miller ,COMMA in sacramento .PERIOD 
and it's just a complex of factory buildings .PERIOD 
and herman miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it's kind of a trite thing to say ,COMMA but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be ,COMMA where the people would come and where the people working would interact .PERIOD 
so it's out in the middle of nowhere ,COMMA and you approach it .PERIOD 
it's copper and galvanize .PERIOD 
i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge ,COMMA so it would buckle .PERIOD 
i spent a lot of time undoing richard meier's aesthetic .PERIOD 
everybody's trying to get the panels perfect ,COMMA and i always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy .PERIOD 
and they end up looking like stone .PERIOD 
this is the central area .PERIOD 
there's a ramp .PERIOD 
and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman .PERIOD 
stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .PERIOD 
and when i was awarded the contract i ,COMMA at the very beginning ,COMMA asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me .PERIOD 
because these were ideas that we were talking about ,COMMA building things next to each other ,COMMA making -- it's all about [a] metaphor for a city ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD 
and so stanley did the little dome thing .PERIOD 
and we did it over the phone and by fax .PERIOD 
he would send me a fax and show me something .PERIOD 
he'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower .PERIOD 
i told him ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA that's too ongepotchket .PERIOD 
i don't want the tower .PERIOD 
so he came back with a simpler building ,COMMA but he put some funny details on it ,COMMA and he moved it closer to my building .PERIOD 
and so i decided to put him in a depression .PERIOD 
i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in .PERIOD 
and so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax ,COMMA going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period .PERIOD 
and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .PERIOD 
and so then i put this big billboard behind it .PERIOD 
and i call it ,COMMA david and goliath .PERIOD 
and that's my cafeteria .PERIOD 
in boston ,COMMA we had that old building on the left .PERIOD 
it was a very prominent building off the freeway ,COMMA and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- i thought -- the language of the neighborhood ,COMMA which had these cornices ,COMMA projecting cornices .PERIOD 
mine got a little exuberant ,COMMA but i used lead copper ,COMMA which is a beautiful material ,COMMA and it turns green in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
instead of ,COMMA like ,COMMA copper in <NUM> or <NUM> .PERIOD 
we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .PERIOD 
and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved ,COMMA because they have very strict kind of design guideline ,COMMA and they wouldn't normally think i would fit them .PERIOD 
the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building .PERIOD 
in barcelona ,COMMA on las ramblas for some film festival ,COMMA i did the hollywood sign going and coming ,COMMA made a building out of it ,COMMA and they built it .PERIOD 
i flew in one night and took this picture .PERIOD 
but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me .PERIOD 
and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa ,COMMA in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back .PERIOD 
it's the support labs ,COMMA which ,COMMA by some coincidence ,COMMA required no windows .PERIOD 
and the shape fit perfectly .PERIOD 
i just joined the points .PERIOD 
in the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment .PERIOD 
that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that i seized ,COMMA because i didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form .PERIOD 
this is a small house somewhere .PERIOD 
they've been building it so long i don't remember where it is .PERIOD 
it's in the west valley .PERIOD 
and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake .PERIOD 
these are the models .PERIOD 
the reality ,COMMA with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad .PERIOD 
and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house .PERIOD 
that big metal thing is a passage ,COMMA and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom ,COMMA which is on the right .PERIOD 
it's kind of like a whole built town .PERIOD 
i was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale .PERIOD 
i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .PERIOD 
this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota .PERIOD 
the owners had a dilemma -- they asked philip to do it .PERIOD 
he was too busy .PERIOD 
we ended up having to make it a sculpture ,COMMA because the dilemma was ,COMMA how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?QUESTIONMARK 
etc .PERIOD etc .PERIOD 
you've got the idea .PERIOD 
and so we finally ended up making it .PERIOD 
these people are art collectors .PERIOD 
and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side .PERIOD 
and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .PERIOD 
it's made of metal and the brown stuff is fin-ply -- it's that formed lumber from finland .PERIOD 
we used it at loyola on the chapel ,COMMA and it didn't work .PERIOD 
in this case we learned how to detail it .PERIOD 
in cleveland ,COMMA there's burnham mall ,COMMA on the left .PERIOD 
going out to the lake ,COMMA you can see all those new buildings we built .PERIOD 
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site .PERIOD 
there's a railroad track .PERIOD 
and the centerline of the mall goes out .PERIOD 
burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built ,COMMA and so we followed .PERIOD 
and this is our building ,COMMA which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company .PERIOD 
we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top ,COMMA folded .PERIOD 
the health club is fastened to the garage with a c-clamp ,COMMA for cleveland .PERIOD 
you drive down .PERIOD 
so it's about a 10-story c-clamp .PERIOD 
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .PERIOD 
and this would be a hotel .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it ,COMMA and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox ,COMMA etc ,COMMA that are underway .PERIOD 
it's hard to do high-rise .PERIOD 
i feel much more comfortable down here .PERIOD 
this is a piece of property in brentwood .PERIOD 
and a long time ago ,COMMA about '<NUM> or something ,COMMA after my house -- i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left .PERIOD 
and she came back ,COMMA i guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site .PERIOD 
i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall ,COMMA creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom ,COMMA which i designed like a kind of a barge ,COMMA looking like a boat .PERIOD 
and that's it ,COMMA built .PERIOD 
the dome was a request from the client .PERIOD 
she wanted a dome somewhere in the house .PERIOD 
she didn't care where .PERIOD 
when you sleep in this bedroom ,COMMA i hope -- i mean ,COMMA i haven't slept in it yet .PERIOD 
i've offered to marry her so i could sleep there ,COMMA but she said i didn't have to do that .PERIOD 
but when you're in that room ,COMMA you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake .PERIOD 
and it's very private .PERIOD 
the landscape is being built around to create a private garden .PERIOD 
and then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room ,COMMA and one on the other side .PERIOD 
these aren't focused very well .PERIOD 
i don't know how to do it from here .PERIOD 
focus the one on the right .PERIOD 
it's up there .PERIOD 
left -- it's my right .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees .PERIOD 
servants' quarters .PERIOD 
a guest bedroom ,COMMA which has this dome with marble on it .PERIOD 
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .PERIOD 
this is the bedroom .PERIOD 
and the bed is back in this space ,COMMA with windows looking out onto the lake .PERIOD 
the material is lead copper ,COMMA like in the building in boston .PERIOD 
and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it's <NUM> by <NUM> -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it .PERIOD 
and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table .PERIOD 
it looks like i got a baldessari painting for free .PERIOD 
but the idea is ,COMMA the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside .PERIOD 
eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private .PERIOD 
and you feel like you're in your own kind of village .PERIOD 
this is for michael eisner -- disney .PERIOD 
we're doing some work for him .PERIOD 
and this is in anaheim ,COMMA california ,COMMA and it's a freeway building .PERIOD 
you go under this bridge at about <NUM> miles an hour ,COMMA and there's another bridge here .PERIOD 
and you're through this room in a split second ,COMMA and the building will sort of reflect that .PERIOD 
on the backside ,COMMA it's much more humane -- entrance ,COMMA dining hall ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and then this thing here -- i'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it .PERIOD 
kind of a fun thing to do .PERIOD 
i'm doing a building in switzerland ,COMMA basel ,COMMA which is an office building for a furniture company .PERIOD 
and we struggled with the image .PERIOD 
these are the early studies ,COMMA but they have to sell furniture to normal people ,COMMA so if i did the building and it was too fancy ,COMMA then people might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the furniture looks ok in his thing ,COMMA but no ,COMMA it ain't going to look good in my normal building .PERIOD 
so we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here ,COMMA and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate .PERIOD 
and you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .PERIOD 
this is in paris ,COMMA along the seine .PERIOD 
palais des sports ,COMMA the gare de lyon over here .PERIOD 
the minister of finance -- the guy that moved from the louvre -- goes in here .PERIOD 
there's a new library across the river .PERIOD 
and back in here ,COMMA in this already treed park ,COMMA we're doing a very dense building called the american center ,COMMA which has a theater ,COMMA apartments ,COMMA dance school ,COMMA an art museum ,COMMA restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program -- bookstores ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
in a very tight ,COMMA small -- this is the ground level .PERIOD 
and the french have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off .PERIOD 
they call it the plan coupe .PERIOD 
and i struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner .PERIOD 
these are the models for it .PERIOD 
i showed you the other model ,COMMA the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem .PERIOD 
apartments ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and these are the kind of study models we did .PERIOD 
and the one on the left is pretty awful .PERIOD 
you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was built .PERIOD 
but out of it came finally this resolution ,COMMA where the elevator piece worked frontally to this ,COMMA parallel to this street ,COMMA and also parallel to here .PERIOD 
and then this kind of twist ,COMMA with this balcony and the skirt ,COMMA kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer .PERIOD 
the restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
so it would all be built in stone ,COMMA in french limestone ,COMMA except for this metal piece .PERIOD 
and it faces into a park .PERIOD 
and the idea was to make this express the energy of this .PERIOD 
on the side facing the street it's much more normal ,COMMA except i slipped a few mansards down ,COMMA so that coming on the point ,COMMA these housing units made a gesture to the corner .PERIOD 
and this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .PERIOD 
if any of you guys have any ideas for it ,COMMA please contact me .PERIOD 
i don't know what to do .PERIOD 
and it's got a fish .PERIOD 
and i keep thinking ,COMMA this is going to be the last fish .PERIOD 
it's like a drug addict .PERIOD 
i say ,COMMA i'm not going to do it anymore -- i don't want to do it anymore -- i'm not going to do it .PERIOD 
and then i do it .PERIOD 
there it is .PERIOD 
but it's the living room .PERIOD 
and this piece here is -- i don't know what it is .PERIOD 
i just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out .PERIOD 
this is euro disney ,COMMA and i've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier .PERIOD 
we've had a lot of fun working together .PERIOD 
i think i'm from mars for them ,COMMA and they are for me ,COMMA but somehow we all manage to work together ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA productively .PERIOD 
so far .PERIOD 
this is a shopping thing .PERIOD 
you come into the magic kingdom and the hotel that tony baxter's group is doing out here .PERIOD 
and another restaurant .PERIOD 
what i did -- because of the paris skies being quite dull ,COMMA i made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station ,COMMA to the route of the train .PERIOD 
it looks like it's kind of been there ,COMMA and then crashed all these simpler forms into it .PERIOD 
the light grid will have a light ,COMMA be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling .PERIOD 
in switzerland -- germany ,COMMA actually -- on the rhine across from basel ,COMMA we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum .PERIOD 
and i tried to -- there's a nick grimshaw building over here ,COMMA there's an oldenburg sculpture over here -- i tried to make a relationship urbanistically .PERIOD 
and i don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building ,COMMA and these pieces here and here .PERIOD 
and as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood .PERIOD 
it's plaster and just zinc .PERIOD 
and you wonder ,COMMA if this is a museum ,COMMA what it's going to be like inside ?QUESTIONMARK 
if it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything ,COMMA and just wait .PERIOD 
i'm so cunning and clever -- i made it quiet and wonderful .PERIOD 
but on the outside it does scream out at you a bit .PERIOD 
it's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff .PERIOD 
and from the building in the back ,COMMA you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills .PERIOD 
i know i'm over time .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA that skylight goes down and becomes that one .PERIOD 
so it's pretty quiet inside .PERIOD 
this is the disney hall -- the concert hall .PERIOD 
it's a complicated project .PERIOD 
it's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring .PERIOD 
and it's not a great building ,COMMA but i approached it optimistically ,COMMA that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us .PERIOD 
and the plan of this -- it's a concert hall .PERIOD 
this is the foyer ,COMMA which is kind of a garden structure .PERIOD 
these are offices ,COMMA which ,COMMA really ,COMMA in the competition ,COMMA we didn't have to design .PERIOD 
but finally ,COMMA there's a hotel there .PERIOD 
these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler ,COMMA composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to moca ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
but everybody liked these forms and liked the space ,COMMA and so that's one of the problems of a competition .PERIOD 
you have to then try and get that back in some way .PERIOD 
and we studied many models .PERIOD 
this was our original model .PERIOD 
these were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the concertgebouw ,COMMA boston and berlin .PERIOD 
everybody liked the surround .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA this is the smallest hall in size ,COMMA and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies .PERIOD 
our client doesn't want balconies ,COMMA so -- and when we met our new acoustician ,COMMA he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .PERIOD 
and we tried many shapes ,COMMA trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical ,COMMA acceptable format .PERIOD 
we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls ,COMMA which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't ,COMMA but now we have them .PERIOD 
and our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room .PERIOD 
that's the idea .PERIOD 
and the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural .PERIOD 
and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit ,COMMA and create intimacy .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so i wouldn't take it literally ,COMMA except the feeling of the space .PERIOD 
we studied the acoustics with laser stuff ,COMMA and they bounce them off this and see where it all works .PERIOD 
but you get the sense of the hall in section .PERIOD 
most halls come straight down into a proscenium .PERIOD 
in this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners .PERIOD 
and so it will be quite a different shape .PERIOD 
the original building ,COMMA because it was frog-like ,COMMA fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well .PERIOD 
when you get into a box ,COMMA it's harder to do it -- and here we are ,COMMA struggling with how to put the hotel in .PERIOD 
and this is a teapot i designed for alessi .PERIOD 
i just stuck it on there .PERIOD 
but this is how i do work .PERIOD i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away .PERIOD 
and of course it's not going to look like that ,COMMA but it is the crazy way i tend to work .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA in la .PERIOD i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower ,COMMA the highest building in la .PERIOD 
larry halprin is doing the stairs .PERIOD 
and i was asked to do a fish ,COMMA and so i did a snake .PERIOD 
it's a public space ,COMMA and i made it kind of a garden structure ,COMMA and you can go in it .PERIOD 
it's a kiva ,COMMA and larry's putting some water in there ,COMMA and it works much better than a fish .PERIOD 
in barcelona i was asked to do a fish ,COMMA and we're working on that ,COMMA at the foot of a ritz-carlton tower being done by skidmore ,COMMA owings and merrill .PERIOD 
and so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it ,COMMA perverted it ,COMMA into the form of the fish ,COMMA and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like ,COMMA that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front ,COMMA and this is really a shopping center with department stores .PERIOD 
and we split these bridges .PERIOD 
originally ,COMMA this was all solid with a hole in it .PERIOD 
we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .PERIOD 
we showed this to the hotel people the other day ,COMMA and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore ,COMMA because of this fish .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i just threw these in -- lou danziger .PERIOD 
i didn't expect lou danziger to be here ,COMMA but this is a building i did for him in <NUM> ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
a little studio -- and it's sadly for sale .PERIOD 
time goes on .PERIOD 
and this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing .PERIOD 
he designed the robot as the cashier ,COMMA and the head moves ,COMMA and i did the rest of it .PERIOD 
it should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first .PERIOD 
it didn't work .PERIOD

in terms of invention ,COMMA i'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects .PERIOD 
i think it's one of the most exciting that i'm working on ,COMMA but i think it's also the simplest .PERIOD 
it's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world .PERIOD 
it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet ,COMMA the number one cause of death in children under five ,COMMA which is . .PERIOD ?QUESTIONMARK water-borne diseases ?QUESTIONMARK diarrhea ?QUESTIONMARK malnutrition ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA it's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this .PERIOD can you believe that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i find this shocking and somewhat appalling .PERIOD 
can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ?QUESTIONMARK 
can't we make better stoves ?QUESTIONMARK 
how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this is a picture of rural haiti .PERIOD haiti is now <NUM> percent deforested .PERIOD 
you'll see scenes like this all over the island .PERIOD 
it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation .PERIOD 
a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil .PERIOD 
so the rains come ,COMMA they go down the rivers ,COMMA and the flooding happens .PERIOD 
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this :COLON people need to cook ,COMMA and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it .PERIOD 
it's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage .PERIOD 
they know perfectly well ,COMMA but they have no other choice .PERIOD 
fossil fuels are not available ,COMMA and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared .PERIOD 
and so this is what they do .PERIOD 
you'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree ,COMMA cut it down and make charcoal out of it .PERIOD 
so not surprisingly ,COMMA there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels .PERIOD 
about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti ,COMMA and we worked with peace corps volunteers there .PERIOD 
this is one such volunteer ,COMMA and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked .PERIOD 
and the idea was that you could take waste paper ;SEMICOLON you could compress it ;SEMICOLON and make briquettes that could be used for fuel .PERIOD 
but this device was very slow .PERIOD 
so our engineering students went to work on it ,COMMA and with some very simple changes ,COMMA they were able to triple the throughput of this device .PERIOD 
so you could imagine they were very excited about it .PERIOD 
and they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them .PERIOD 
and one of the things that they found was they didn't burn .PERIOD 
so it was a little discouraging to the students .PERIOD 
and in fact if you look closely ,COMMA right here ,COMMA you can see it says ,COMMA us .PERIOD peace corps .PERIOD 
as it turns out ,COMMA there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village .PERIOD 
and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village ,COMMA it was <NUM> kilometers away .PERIOD 
and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel .PERIOD 
what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level .PERIOD 
you see these all over haiti as well .PERIOD they're small-scale sugar mills .PERIOD 
and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse .PERIOD 
it has no other use .PERIOD it has no nutritional value ,COMMA so they don't feed it to the animals .PERIOD 
it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it .PERIOD 
so over the next couple of years ,COMMA students and i worked to develop a process .PERIOD 
so you start with the bagasse ,COMMA and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum .PERIOD 
and conveniently ,COMMA one of my students was from ghana ,COMMA and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte ,COMMA which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .PERIOD 
and so what we did was we looked ,COMMA and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti ,COMMA under the name of manioc .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA it's grown all over the world -- yucca ,COMMA tapioca ,COMMA manioc ,COMMA cassava ,COMMA it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable .PERIOD 
and you can make a very thick ,COMMA sticky porridge out of it ,COMMA which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes .PERIOD 
so we did this .PERIOD we went down to haiti .PERIOD 
these are the graduates of the first ecole de chabon ,COMMA or charcoal institute .PERIOD and these -- -- that's right .PERIOD so i'm actually an instructor at mit as well as cit .PERIOD 
and these are the briquettes that we made .PERIOD 
now i'm going to take you to a different continent .PERIOD this is india ,COMMA and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india ;SEMICOLON it's cow dung .PERIOD 
and more than in haiti ,COMMA this produces really smoky fires ,COMMA and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel .PERIOD 
kids and women are especially affected by it ,COMMA because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires .PERIOD 
so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there .PERIOD 
well unfortunately ,COMMA they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava ,COMMA but that didn't stop us .PERIOD 
what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass .PERIOD 
and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area .PERIOD 
and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure ,COMMA which they used ordinarily for their fuel .PERIOD 
and we did side-by-side tests ,COMMA and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung .PERIOD 
and you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA it heats the water a lot more quickly .PERIOD 
and so we were very happy ,COMMA thus far .PERIOD 
but one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal ,COMMA it didn't burn as long .PERIOD and the briquettes crumbled a little bit ,COMMA and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking .PERIOD 
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti .PERIOD 
so we went back to mit ,COMMA we took out the instron machine ,COMMA and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this ,COMMA we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process ,COMMA to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there .PERIOD 
and after some time ,COMMA we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal ,COMMA which actually now burns longer ,COMMA cleaner than wood charcoal .PERIOD 
so now we're in a situation where we have a product ,COMMA which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace ,COMMA which is a very wonderful place to be .PERIOD 
in haiti alone ,COMMA about <NUM> million trees are cut down every year .PERIOD 
there's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those .PERIOD 
in addition ,COMMA the revenue generated from that charcoal is <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
that's an awful lot for a country of haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
so this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project .PERIOD 
and one of the things that i think is also interesting ,COMMA is i have a friend up at uc berkeley who's been doing risk analysis .PERIOD 
and he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal .PERIOD 
and he's found that worldwide ,COMMA you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel .PERIOD that's remarkable ,COMMA but up until now ,COMMA there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees .PERIOD 
but now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel .PERIOD 
one of the really exciting things ,COMMA though ,COMMA is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month .PERIOD 
and this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the coolest thing ,COMMA and it's even lower tech than what you just saw ,COMMA if you can imagine such a thing .PERIOD here it is .PERIOD 
so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK this is corncobs turned into charcoal .PERIOD 
and the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made .PERIOD this is my $100 laptop ,COMMA right here .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA like nick ,COMMA i brought samples .PERIOD 
so we can pass these around .PERIOD 
they're fully functional ,COMMA field-tested ,COMMA ready to roll out .PERIOD 
and i think one of the things ,COMMA which is also remarkable about this technology ,COMMA is that the technology transfer is so easy .PERIOD 
and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now ,COMMA which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life .PERIOD 
but once you see it ,COMMA like you guys in the front row ,COMMA all right ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA ok .PERIOD so anyway -- -- here it is .PERIOD and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things .PERIOD 
so not only do you have health benefits ,COMMA you have environmental benefits .PERIOD 
people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .PERIOD 
it's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics ,COMMA or environment and economics .PERIOD 
so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting ,COMMA and i'm really looking forward to see where it takes us .PERIOD 
so when we talk about ,COMMA now ,COMMA the future we will create ,COMMA one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .PERIOD 
and now i don't actually mean the world that we live in .PERIOD 
i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat .PERIOD 
i mean the world where women and children spend <NUM> billion hours a year fetching water .PERIOD 
that's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water .PERIOD 
it's a place where ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if this were india ,COMMA in this room ,COMMA only three of us would have a car .PERIOD 
if this were afghanistan ,COMMA only one person in this room would know how the use the internet .PERIOD 
if this were zambia ,COMMA <NUM> of you would be farmers ,COMMA <NUM> of you would have aids or hiv .PERIOD 
these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for .PERIOD 
these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers ,COMMA our designers ,COMMA our business people ,COMMA our entrepreneurs to be facing .PERIOD 
these are the solutions that we need to find .PERIOD 
i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address .PERIOD 
one of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise ,COMMA so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making ,COMMA poultry rearing ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale .PERIOD 
the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops .PERIOD 
and we need to rethink our development strategies ,COMMA so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers ,COMMA but rather to stop being poor farmers .PERIOD 
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .PERIOD 
we need to work with the people in these communities ,COMMA and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems .PERIOD that's the best way to do it .PERIOD 
we shouldn't be doing it from outside .PERIOD 
so we need to create this future ,COMMA and we need to start doing it now .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on .PERIOD 
amy smith :COLON a couple of other things that we're working on are looking at ways to do low-cost water quality testing ,COMMA so that communities can maintain their own water systems ,COMMA know when they're working ,COMMA know when they treat them ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
we're also looking at low-cost water treatment systems .PERIOD 
one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that .PERIOD 
what's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA i think its large numbers of people moving it forward .PERIOD 
it's a difficult thing ;SEMICOLON it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income .PERIOD 
so you can't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .PERIOD 
and we're a pretty small staff ,COMMA which is me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i do what i can with the students .PERIOD 
we have <NUM> students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward .PERIOD 
the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame ,COMMA as -- you know ,COMMA you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years ;SEMICOLON you have to be looking five or <NUM> years ahead .PERIOD 
but i think with the vision to do that ,COMMA we can move forward .PERIOD 
my thing with school lunch is ,COMMA it's a social justice issue .PERIOD 
i'm the director of nutrition services for the berkeley unified school district .PERIOD i have <NUM> employees and <NUM> locations ,COMMA <NUM> kids .PERIOD 
i'm doing <NUM> meals a day and i've been doing it for two years ,COMMA trying to change how we feed kids in america .PERIOD 
and that's what i want to talk to you a little bit about today .PERIOD 
i put salad bars in all of our schools when i got there .PERIOD 
everyone says it couldn't be done .PERIOD 
little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar ,COMMA big kids would spit in it -- neither happened .PERIOD 
when i took over this ,COMMA i tried to really figure out ,COMMA like ,COMMA what my vision would be .PERIOD 
how do we really change children's relationship to food ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'll tell you why we need to change it ,COMMA but we absolutely have to change it .PERIOD 
and what i came to understand is ,COMMA we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet ,COMMA healthy food and healthy kids .PERIOD 
and that if we don't do that ,COMMA the antithesis ,COMMA although we've heard otherwise ,COMMA is we're really going to become extinct ,COMMA because we're feeding our children to death .PERIOD 
that's my premise .PERIOD 
we're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker .PERIOD 
and the reason this is happening ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food ,COMMA the way the government oversees our food ,COMMA the way the usda puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy ,COMMA and allows unhealthy food into schools .PERIOD 
and by -- tacitly ,COMMA all of us send our kids ,COMMA or grandchildren ,COMMA or nieces ,COMMA or nephews ,COMMA to school and tell them to learn ,COMMA you know ,COMMA learn what's in those schools .PERIOD 
and when you feed these kids bad food ,COMMA that's what they're learning .PERIOD so that's really what this is all about .PERIOD 
the way we got here is because of big agribusiness .PERIOD 
we now live in a country where most of us don't decide ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA what we eat .PERIOD we see big businesses ,COMMA monsanto and dupont ,COMMA who brought out agent orange and stain-resistant carpet .PERIOD 
they control <NUM> percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .PERIOD 
these are -- <NUM> companies control much of what's in our grocery stores ,COMMA much of what people eat .PERIOD and that's really ,COMMA really a problem .PERIOD 
so when i started thinking about these issues and how i was going to change what kids ate ,COMMA i really started focusing on what we would teach them .PERIOD 
and clearly ,COMMA with what's going on with fossil fuel usage ,COMMA or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away ,COMMA as oil hits its peak oil ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should ,COMMA or could ,COMMA be moving food <NUM> miles before we eat it .PERIOD 
so we talked to kids about that ,COMMA and we really start to feed kids regional food .PERIOD 
and then we talk about organic food .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA most school districts can't really afford organic food ,COMMA but we ,COMMA as a nation ,COMMA have to start thinking about consuming ,COMMA growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals .PERIOD 
we can't keep doing that .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it doesn't work .PERIOD 
and the results of that are kids getting sick .PERIOD 
one of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .PERIOD 
seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry .PERIOD 
we are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day .PERIOD 
seventy percent -- it's unbelievable .PERIOD 
and the result of it is ,COMMA we have diseases .PERIOD 
we have things like e .PERIOD coli that we can't fix ,COMMA that we can't make kids better when they get sick .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed ,COMMA but it's an issue in the food supply .PERIOD 
one of my favorite facts is that us .PERIOD agriculture uses <NUM> billion pounds of pesticides every year .PERIOD 
that means every one of us ,COMMA and our children ,COMMA consumes what would equal a five-pound bag -- those bags you have at home .PERIOD if i had one here and ripped it open ,COMMA and that pile i would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply ,COMMA because of the way we consume produce in america .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA we could talk about rachel carson and ddt ,COMMA but we know it wasn't good for you and me .PERIOD 
and that is what the usda allows in our food supply .PERIOD 
and that has to change ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
the usda cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed .PERIOD 
we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .PERIOD 
the antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .PERIOD 
that's what i really try and get people to understand .PERIOD 
i really try and teach it to kids .PERIOD i think it's the most important .PERIOD 
it's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet ,COMMA in which kids will grow up to be healthy ,COMMA and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing .PERIOD 
it really is just a new idea .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA people toss around sustainability ,COMMA but we have to figure out what sustainability is .PERIOD 
in less than <NUM> years ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just in a few generations ,COMMA we've gone from being <NUM> -- being <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent farmers to less than <NUM> percent of farmers .PERIOD 
we now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- <NUM> million prisoners ,COMMA <NUM> million farmers .PERIOD 
and we spend <NUM> dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison ,COMMA and school districts spend <NUM> dollars a year feeding a child .PERIOD 
and what's happening is ,COMMA we're getting sick .PERIOD 
we're getting sick and our kids are getting sick .PERIOD 
it is about what we feed them .PERIOD 
we really are what we eat .PERIOD 
and if we continue down this path ,COMMA if we continue to feed kids bad food ,COMMA if we continue not to teach them what good food is ,COMMA what's going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA what is going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's going to happen to our whole medical system ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's going to happen is ,COMMA we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own .PERIOD 
and if that's not enough ,COMMA they've gone on to say ,COMMA most before they graduate high school .PERIOD 
this means that <NUM> or <NUM> percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade .PERIOD within a decade .PERIOD 
what's going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the cdc has gone further to say that those children born in the year <NUM> could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents .PERIOD 
because eight-year-olds don't get to decide -- and if they do ,COMMA you should be in therapy .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we are responsible for what kids eat .PERIOD 
but oops ,COMMA maybe they're responsible for what kids eat .PERIOD 
big companies spend <NUM> billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids .PERIOD 
<NUM> billion dollars a year .PERIOD <NUM> ads most kids see .PERIOD 
they spend <NUM> dollars for every one dollar -- <NUM> dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy ,COMMA nutritious food .PERIOD 
the result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets .PERIOD 
you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more ,COMMA and more ,COMMA and more .PERIOD 
and the one over there ,COMMA that's bigger than my head ,COMMA is what mcdonald's and burger king and those big companies think we should eat .PERIOD 
and why can they serve that much ?QUESTIONMARK 
why can we have 29-cent big gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's because of the way the government commodifies food ,COMMA and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really ,COMMA really cheap .PERIOD 
which is why i say it's a social justice issue .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i said i'm doing this in berkeley ,COMMA and you might think ,COMMA oh ,COMMA berkeley .PERIOD of course you can do it in berkeley .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this is the food i found <NUM> months ago .PERIOD 
this is not even food .PERIOD 
this is the stuff we were feeding our kids :COLON extremo burritos ,COMMA corn dogs ,COMMA pizza pockets ,COMMA grilled cheese sandwiches .PERIOD 
everything came in plastic ,COMMA in cardboard .PERIOD 
the only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .PERIOD 
the only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher ,COMMA because if it didn't come in a can ,COMMA it came frozen in a box .PERIOD 
the usda allows this .PERIOD 
the usda allows all of this stuff .PERIOD 
chicken nuggets ,COMMA tater tots ,COMMA chocolate milk with high fructose ,COMMA canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal .PERIOD 
that's what the government says is okay to feed our kids .PERIOD 
it ain't okay .PERIOD you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it is not okay .PERIOD 
and we ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA have to understand that this is about us ,COMMA that we can make a difference here .PERIOD 
now i don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets ,COMMA but i'm sure you're rich if you did .PERIOD 
but whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart ,COMMA a giraffe ,COMMA a star ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA tyson did ,COMMA because there's no chicken in the chicken .PERIOD 
and that they could figure it out ,COMMA that we could sell this stuff to kids .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken ?QUESTIONMARK 
but this is what most schools serve .PERIOD 
we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .PERIOD 
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA that vegetables are actually colorful ,COMMA that they have flavor ,COMMA that carrots grow in the ground ,COMMA that strawberries grow in the ground .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we have to change the way we teach kids about these things .PERIOD 
there's a lot of stuff we can do .PERIOD there's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs .PERIOD there's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA in berkeley ,COMMA we've gone totally fresh .PERIOD 
we have no high-fructose corn syrup ,COMMA no trans fats ,COMMA no processed foods .PERIOD 
we're cooking from scratch every day .PERIOD 
we have <NUM> percent of our -- thank you -- <NUM> percent of our stuff is organic and local .PERIOD we cook .PERIOD 
those are my hands .PERIOD i get up at <NUM> am .PERIOD 
every day and go cook the food for the kids ,COMMA because this is what we need to do .PERIOD 
we can't keep serving kids processed crap ,COMMA full of chemicals ,COMMA and expect these are going to be healthy citizens .PERIOD 
if they're eating chemicals all the time ,COMMA they're not going to be able to think .PERIOD 
they're not going to be smart .PERIOD 
you know what ?QUESTIONMARK they're just going to be sick .PERIOD 
now one of the things that -- what happened when i went into berkeley is i realized that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this was all pretty amazing to people ,COMMA very ,COMMA very different ,COMMA and i needed to market it .PERIOD 
i came up with these calendars that i sent home to every parent .PERIOD 
now i'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district .PERIOD 
so this is a typical menu .PERIOD 
this is what we're serving this week at the schools .PERIOD 
and you see these recipes on the side ?QUESTIONMARK 
those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .PERIOD 
they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .PERIOD 
they also may be growing them .PERIOD and we serve them in the cafeterias .PERIOD 
if we're going to change children's relationship to food ,COMMA it's delicious ,COMMA nutritious food in the cafeterias ,COMMA hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes -- and academic curriculum to tie it all together .PERIOD 
now you've probably garnered that i don't love the usda ,COMMA and i don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid ,COMMA this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA run up into the end of the rainbow ,COMMA i don't know what you do with it .PERIOD so ,COMMA i came up with my own .PERIOD 
this is available on my website in english and spanish ,COMMA and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food .PERIOD 
the really tiny hamburger ,COMMA the really big vegetables .PERIOD 
we have to start changing this .PERIOD 
we have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference .PERIOD 
we have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools .PERIOD 
and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation ,COMMA maybe two ,COMMA of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food ,COMMA one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .PERIOD 
what are kids learning ?QUESTIONMARK where is the family time ?QUESTIONMARK 
where is socialization ?QUESTIONMARK where is discussion ?QUESTIONMARK 
where is learning to talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
i work with kids a lot .PERIOD these are kids i work with in harlem .PERIOD 
eatwise -- enlightened and aware teens who inspire smart eating .PERIOD 
we have to teach kids that coke and pop tarts aren't breakfast .PERIOD 
we have recycling in all of our schools .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important ,COMMA we have to teach kids about in school .PERIOD 
it has to be so much a part of them that they really get it .PERIOD 
one of the things i do a lot is public-private partnerships .PERIOD 
i work with private companies who are willing to do r &amp ;SEMICOLON d with me ,COMMA who are willing to do distribution for me ,COMMA who are really willing to work to go into schools .PERIOD 
schools are underfunded .PERIOD 
most schools in america spend less than <NUM> dollars a year teaching a child .PERIOD 
that comes down to under five dollars an hour .PERIOD 
most of you spend <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them .PERIOD 
so we're spending less than <NUM> dollars an hour on the educational system .PERIOD 
and if we're going to change it ,COMMA and change how we feed kids ,COMMA we really have to rethink that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA public and private partnerships ,COMMA advocacy groups ,COMMA working with foundations .PERIOD 
in our school district ,COMMA the way we afford this is our school district allocates <NUM> percent of the general fund towards nutrition services .PERIOD and i think if every school district allocated a half to one percent ,COMMA we could start to really fix this program .PERIOD 
we really need to change it .PERIOD 
it's going to take more money .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA it's not all about food ;SEMICOLON it's also about kids getting exercise .PERIOD 
and one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch .PERIOD 
it's sort of this duh thing .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess ,COMMA you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA at one in the afternoon ,COMMA they're totally crashing .PERIOD 
these are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up ,COMMA because they haven't had lunch .PERIOD 
so if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class ,COMMA believe me ,COMMA they're going to sit there and eat their lunch .PERIOD 
we need to -- we need to educate .PERIOD 
we need to educate the kids .PERIOD 
we need to educate the staff .PERIOD 
two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm not that better off now .PERIOD 
but we really have to educate .PERIOD 
we have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA they don't -- because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long .PERIOD 
we need 40-minute lunches -- most schools have 20-minute lunches -- and lunches that are time-appropriate .PERIOD 
there was just a big study done ,COMMA and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and <NUM> in the morning .PERIOD 
that is not lunchtime .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's crazy .PERIOD it's crazy what we're doing .PERIOD 
and just remember ,COMMA at very least tacitly ,COMMA this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing .PERIOD 
i think if we're going to fix this ,COMMA one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the national school lunch program .PERIOD 
instead of the national school lunch program being under the usda ,COMMA i think it should be under cdc .PERIOD 
if we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative ,COMMA and we started thinking about food as health ,COMMA then i think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA finance <NUM> on this ,COMMA and this -- i'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece ,COMMA because i think this is something we all have to understand .PERIOD 
the national school lunch program spends <NUM> billion dollars feeding <NUM> million children a year .PERIOD 
that number probably needs to double .PERIOD 
people say ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA where are we going to get <NUM> billion ?QUESTIONMARK 
we spend <NUM> billion dollars a year on diet aids .PERIOD 
we spend <NUM> billion dollars on vegetables ,COMMA which is why we need all the diet aids .PERIOD 
we spend <NUM> billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today ,COMMA with nine percent of our kids having type <NUM> diabetes .PERIOD 
<NUM> billion .PERIOD 
so you know what ,COMMA when we talk about needing <NUM> billion more ,COMMA it's not a lot .PERIOD 
most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead .PERIOD 
that means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> cents .PERIOD in la ,COMMA it's <NUM> cents .PERIOD 
so we're spending less than a dollar ,COMMA ok ,COMMA on lunch .PERIOD 
now i don't know about you ,COMMA but i go to starbucks and pete's and places like that ,COMMA and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars .PERIOD 
one gourmet coffee ,COMMA one ,COMMA is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools .PERIOD 
you know what ?QUESTIONMARK we should be ashamed .PERIOD 
we ,COMMA as a country ,COMMA should be ashamed at that .PERIOD 
the richest country .PERIOD 
in our country ,COMMA it's the kids that need it the most ,COMMA who get this really ,COMMA really lousy food .PERIOD 
it's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food .PERIOD 
those are the same kids who we should be taking care of .PERIOD 
we can all make a difference .PERIOD 
that every single one of us ,COMMA whether we have children ,COMMA whether we care about children ,COMMA whether we have nieces or nephews ,COMMA or anything -- that we can make a difference .PERIOD 
whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids ,COMMA whether you take your kids ,COMMA or grandchildren ,COMMA or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market .PERIOD just do tastings with them .PERIOD 
sit down and care .PERIOD 
and on the macro level ,COMMA we're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign ,COMMA and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders ,COMMA what about asking for the health of our children ?QUESTIONMARK 
thank you .PERIOD 
our face is hugely important because it's the external ,COMMA visual part that everybody else sees .PERIOD 
let's not forget it's a functional entity .PERIOD 
we have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body :COLON the brain .PERIOD 
it's where our senses are located ,COMMA our special senses -- our vision ,COMMA our speech ,COMMA our hearing ,COMMA our smell ,COMMA our taste .PERIOD 
and this bone is peppered ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA with the light shining through the skull with cavities ,COMMA the sinuses ,COMMA which warm and moisten the air we breathe .PERIOD 
but also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight ,COMMA we wouldn't be able to hold it erect ,COMMA we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us .PERIOD 
this woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat .PERIOD 
attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression ,COMMA our universal language of expression ,COMMA our social-signaling system .PERIOD 
and overlying this is the skin drape ,COMMA which is a hugely complex three-dimensional structure -- taking right-angled bends here and there ,COMMA having thin areas like the eyelids ,COMMA thick areas like the cheek ,COMMA different colors .PERIOD 
and then we have the sensual factor of the face .PERIOD 
where do we like to kiss people ?QUESTIONMARK 
on the lips .PERIOD nibble the ears maybe .PERIOD 
it's the face where we're attracted to with that .PERIOD 
but let's not forget the hair .PERIOD 
you're looking at the image on your left-hand side -- that's my son with his eyebrows present .PERIOD 
there's a definite difference .PERIOD 
and imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose ,COMMA he'd look even odder still .PERIOD 
dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us .PERIOD 
it's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves ,COMMA and we only see ourselves in freeze-frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live .PERIOD 
dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance .PERIOD 
they don't need this .PERIOD they need psychiatric help .PERIOD 
he doesn't have dysmorphophobia ,COMMA but i'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA he looks entirely normal .PERIOD 
age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes .PERIOD 
so children judge themselves ,COMMA learn to judge themselves ,COMMA by the behavior of adults around them .PERIOD 
here's a classic example :COLON rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull ,COMMA has obliterated her nose ,COMMA and she's having difficulty seeing .PERIOD 
as you can see ,COMMA it's blocking her vision .PERIOD 
she's also in danger ,COMMA when she damages this ,COMMA of bleeding profusely .PERIOD 
they've grown used to their face ;SEMICOLON they think they're special .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed .PERIOD 
and occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them .PERIOD 
but other adults say incredibly painful things .PERIOD 
they say ,COMMA how dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people .PERIOD 
shouldn't you be doing something about this ?QUESTIONMARK why haven't you had it removed ?QUESTIONMARK 
and other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion ,COMMA because -- a natural curiosity .PERIOD 
and that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature .PERIOD 
after surgery ,COMMA everything normalizes .PERIOD 
the adults behave more naturally ,COMMA and the children play more readily with other children .PERIOD 
as teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance .PERIOD 
we're trying to struggle to find our identity .PERIOD 
so our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world .PERIOD 
just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days .PERIOD 
how long did you spend looking in the mirror every day ,COMMA practicing your sardonic look ,COMMA practicing your serious look ,COMMA trying to look like sean connery ,COMMA as i did ,COMMA trying to raise one eyebrow ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a crippling time .PERIOD 
i've chosen to show this profile view of sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward .PERIOD 
turn to the person next to you ,COMMA push your lower jaws forward .PERIOD turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable .PERIOD 
that's exactly what people used to say to sue .PERIOD 
she wasn't miserable at all .PERIOD 
but people used to say to her ,COMMA why are you so miserable ?QUESTIONMARK 
people were making misjudgments all the time on her mood .PERIOD 
teachers and peers were underestimating her ;SEMICOLON she was teased at school .PERIOD 
so she chose to have facial surgery .PERIOD 
after the facial surgery ,COMMA she said ,COMMA my face now reflects my personality .PERIOD 
and that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers .PERIOD 
is this change ,COMMA though ,COMMA a real change ,COMMA or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery .PERIOD 
and what we found was -- we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after -- what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery .PERIOD 
well that's not surprising ,COMMA but we also asked them to judge them on honesty ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA friendliness ,COMMA violence .PERIOD 
they were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -- before the surgery .PERIOD 
after the surgery ,COMMA they were perceived as being more intelligent ,COMMA more friendly ,COMMA more honest ,COMMA less violent -- and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character .PERIOD 
when people get older ,COMMA they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery .PERIOD 
their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune .PERIOD 
what happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma .PERIOD 
so this is a photograph of henry ,COMMA two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone ,COMMA his upper jaw ,COMMA his eye-socket .PERIOD 
he looks pretty good at this stage .PERIOD 
but over the course of the next <NUM> years he had <NUM> more operations ,COMMA as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly .PERIOD 
i learned a huge amount from henry .PERIOD 
henry taught me that you can carry on working .PERIOD 
he worked as an advocate .PERIOD he continued to play cricket .PERIOD 
he enjoyed life to the full ,COMMA and this was probably because he had a successful ,COMMA fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially .PERIOD 
i don't say he overcame this ;SEMICOLON he didn't overcome it .PERIOD 
this was something more than that .PERIOD he ignored it .PERIOD 
he ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it .PERIOD 
and that's what these people can do .PERIOD 
henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well .PERIOD 
this is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the united kingdom to have operated on .PERIOD 
it was my longest operation .PERIOD 
it took <NUM> hours .PERIOD i did it with my neurosurgeon .PERIOD 
we removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye ,COMMA his nose ,COMMA the skull bones ,COMMA the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back .PERIOD 
he continued to work as a psychiatric nurse .PERIOD 
he got married .PERIOD he had a son called jeremiah .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA he said ,COMMA this painting of me with my son jeremiah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am .PERIOD 
his facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family ;SEMICOLON he had a successful ,COMMA fulfilling job .PERIOD 
so we've seen that we can change people's faces .PERIOD 
but when we change people's faces ,COMMA are we changing their identity -- for better or for worse ?QUESTIONMARK 
for instance ,COMMA there are two different types of facial surgery .PERIOD 
we can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery -- like sue .PERIOD 
when they have facial surgery ,COMMA they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people .PERIOD 
they don't feel different .PERIOD 
they feel that they've actually gained what they never had ,COMMA that their face now reflects their personality .PERIOD 
and actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery .PERIOD 
if you do cosmetic surgery ,COMMA patients are often less happy .PERIOD 
they're trying to achieve difference in their lives .PERIOD 
sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life .PERIOD 
she was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality .PERIOD 
but then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery .PERIOD 
they're people who have their face shot off .PERIOD 
they have it forced upon them .PERIOD 
their identity doesn't change .PERIOD 
is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a western phenomenon ?QUESTIONMARK 
muzetta's family give the lie to this .PERIOD 
this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face ,COMMA which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly .PERIOD 
after she had surgery to remove the tumor ,COMMA her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress ,COMMA a pink ribbon in her hair ,COMMA and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world ,COMMA despite the fact that they were orthodox muslims and the mother wore a full burqa .PERIOD 
it's been going on since we can think of lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces .PERIOD 
he said you could see criminal faces ,COMMA judging them just on the photographs that were showed .PERIOD 
we look at oj .PERIOD -- he's a good-looking guy .PERIOD 
we'd like to spend time with him .PERIOD he looks friendly .PERIOD 
now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer ,COMMA and actually he's not the good guy .PERIOD 
and beauty doesn't equate to goodness ,COMMA and certainly doesn't equate to contentment .PERIOD 
so we've talked about the static face and judging the static face ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA we're more comfortable with judging the moving face .PERIOD 
we think we can judge people on their expressions .PERIOD 
uk .PERIOD jurors in the uk .PERIOD justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity -- the blink ,COMMA the hesitation .PERIOD 
and so they want to see live witnesses .PERIOD 
todorov tells us that ,COMMA in a tenth of a second ,COMMA we can make a judgment on somebody's face .PERIOD 
are we uncomfortable with this image ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA we are .PERIOD 
would we be happy if our doctor's face ,COMMA our lawyer's face ,COMMA our financial adviser's face was covered ?QUESTIONMARK 
we'd be pretty uncomfortable .PERIOD 
but are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement ?QUESTIONMARK 
the truth is that there's a five-minute rule ,COMMA not the tenth-of-a-second rule like todorov ,COMMA but a five-minute rule .PERIOD 
if you spend five minutes with somebody ,COMMA you start looking beyond their facial appearance ,COMMA and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them ,COMMA and the people who you didn't immediately seek out ,COMMA because you didn't find them particularly attractive ,COMMA become attractive people because of their personality .PERIOD 
so we've talked a lot about facial appearance .PERIOD 
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we're at and where we're going .PERIOD 
and you can see in the images afterward ,COMMA we've managed to reconstruct her successfully .PERIOD 
but that's not good enough .PERIOD 
this is what ann wants .PERIOD she wants to be out kayaking ,COMMA she wants to be out climbing mountains .PERIOD 
and that's what she achieved ,COMMA and that's what we have to get to .PERIOD 
this is a horrific image ,COMMA so i'm putting my hand up now .PERIOD 
this is a photograph of adi ,COMMA a nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery .PERIOD 
and he lost his lower jaw ,COMMA his lip ,COMMA his chin and his upper jaw and teeth .PERIOD 
this is the bar that he set for us .PERIOD 
i want to look like this .PERIOD this is how i looked before .PERIOD 
so with modern technology ,COMMA we used computers to make models .PERIOD 
we made a model of the jaw without bone in it .PERIOD 
we then bent a plate up to it .PERIOD 
we put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position .PERIOD 
we then put bone and tissue from the back .PERIOD 
here you can see the plate holding it ,COMMA and you can see the implants being put in -- so that in one operation we achieve this and this .PERIOD 
so the patient's life is restored .PERIOD 
that's the good news .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before .PERIOD 
it's skin from his back .PERIOD 
it's thicker ,COMMA it's darker ,COMMA it's coarser ,COMMA it doesn't have the contours .PERIOD 
and that's where we're failing ,COMMA and that's where we need the face transplant .PERIOD 
the face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin .PERIOD 
we can replace the underlying skeletal structure ,COMMA but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin .PERIOD 
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
they have an increased risk of infection ,COMMA an increased risk of malignancy .PERIOD 
this is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart ,COMMA or liver ,COMMA or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant ,COMMA and as a result ,COMMA are the patients going to say ,COMMA if they get a malignant cancer <NUM> or <NUM> years on ,COMMA i wish i'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because i'm now dying of a malignant cancer ?QUESTIONMARK we don't know yet .PERIOD 
we also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity .PERIOD 
bernard devauchelle and sylvie testelin ,COMMA who did the first operation ,COMMA are studying that .PERIOD 
donors are going to be short on the ground ,COMMA because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death ?QUESTIONMARK 
so there are going to be problems with face transplantation .PERIOD 
so the better news is the future's almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .PERIOD 
just imagine ,COMMA i can make a biologically-degradable template .PERIOD 
i can put it in place where it's meant to be .PERIOD 
i can sprinkle a few cells ,COMMA stem cells from the patient's own hip ,COMMA a little bit of genetically engineered protein ,COMMA and lo and behold ,COMMA leave it for four months and the face is grown .PERIOD 
this is a bit like a julia child recipe .PERIOD 
but we've still got problems .PERIOD 
we've got mouth cancer to solve .PERIOD 
we're still not reconstructing them well enough .PERIOD 
in the uk .PERIOD we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people .PERIOD 
we need to do research .PERIOD 
and the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research .PERIOD 
and we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future ,COMMA so we don't just sit on our laurels and say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA we're doing okay .PERIOD 
let's leave it as it is .PERIOD 
thank you very much indeed .PERIOD 
i'm going to take you on a journey very quickly .PERIOD 
to explain the wish ,COMMA i'm going to have to take you somewhere which many people haven't been ,COMMA and that's around the world .PERIOD 
when i was about <NUM> years old ,COMMA kate store and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work .PERIOD 
not only about responding to natural disasters ,COMMA but involved in systemic issues .PERIOD 
we believed that where the resources and expertise are scarce ,COMMA innovative ,COMMA sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives .PERIOD 
so i started my life as an architect ,COMMA or training as an architect ,COMMA and i was always interested in socially responsible design ,COMMA and how you can really make an impact .PERIOD 
but when i went to architectural school ,COMMA it seemed that i was the black sheep in the family .PERIOD 
many architects seemed to think that when you design ,COMMA you design a jewel ,COMMA and it's a jewel that you try and crave for .PERIOD 
so you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it ,COMMA but for the community as a whole .PERIOD 
and in <NUM> ,COMMA we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo and i didn't know what i was doing ;SEMICOLON like i say ,COMMA mid-20s ,COMMA and i'm the ,COMMA i'm the internet generation ,COMMA so we started a website .PERIOD 
we put a call out there ,COMMA and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world .PERIOD 
that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas .PERIOD 
two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub-saharan africa ,COMMA responding to the hiv/aids pandemic .PERIOD 
that led to <NUM> entries from <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
we also have designers from around the world that participate .PERIOD 
and we had an exhibit of work that followed that .PERIOD 
<NUM> was the tipping point for us .PERIOD 
we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran and bam ,COMMA also following up on our work in africa .PERIOD 
so we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere .PERIOD 
and then also i will go into some more projects .PERIOD 
<NUM> mother nature kicked our arse .PERIOD 
i think we can pretty much assume that <NUM> was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters .PERIOD 
and because of the internet ,COMMA and because of connections to blogs and so forth ,COMMA within literally hours of the tsunami ,COMMA we were already raising funds ,COMMA getting involved ,COMMA working with people on the ground .PERIOD 
we run from a couple of laptops in the first couple of days ,COMMA i had <NUM> emails from people needing help .PERIOD 
so we began to get involved in projects there ,COMMA and i'll talk about some others .PERIOD 
and then of course ,COMMA this year we've been responding to katrina ,COMMA as well as following up on our reconstruction works .PERIOD 
so this is a brief overview .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help ,COMMA or the number of requests that i was getting .PERIOD 
it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone .PERIOD 
so we decided to embrace an open source model of business -- that anyone ,COMMA anywhere in the world ,COMMA could start a local chapter ,COMMA and they can get involved in local problems .PERIOD 
because i believe there is no such thing as utopia .PERIOD 
all problems are local .PERIOD all solutions are local .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA and that means ,COMMA you know ,COMMA somebody who is based in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do .PERIOD so what happened is ,COMMA we used meetup and all these other kind of internet tools ,COMMA and we ended up having <NUM> chapters starting up ,COMMA thousands of architects in <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
so the bullet point -- sorry ,COMMA i never do a suit ,COMMA so i knew that i was going to take this off .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA because i'm going to do it very quick .PERIOD 
i'm adding that to my time .PERIOD 
so what you don't know is ,COMMA we've got these thousands of designers working around the world ,COMMA connected basically by a website ,COMMA and we have a staff of three .PERIOD 
by doing something ,COMMA the fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it ,COMMA we did it .PERIOD and so there's something to be said about naivete .PERIOD 
so seven years later ,COMMA we've developed so that we've got advocacy ,COMMA instigation and implementation .PERIOD we advocate for good design ,COMMA not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums ,COMMA op-eds ;SEMICOLON we have a book on humanitarian work ;SEMICOLON but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy .PERIOD 
we can talk about fema ,COMMA but that's another talk .PERIOD 
instigation ,COMMA developing ideas with communities and ngos doing open-source design competitions .PERIOD 
referring ,COMMA matchmaking with communities and then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work ,COMMA because when you invent ,COMMA it's never a reality until it's built .PERIOD 
so here's a select number of projects .PERIOD 
kosovo .PERIOD this is kosovo in '<NUM> .PERIOD we did an open design competition ,COMMA like i said .PERIOD it led to a whole variety of ideas ,COMMA and this wasn't about emergency shelter ,COMMA but transitional shelter that would last five to <NUM> years ,COMMA that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in ,COMMA and that they would rebuild their own home .PERIOD 
this wasn't imposing an architecture on a community ;SEMICOLON this was giving them the tools and ,COMMA and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to .PERIOD 
we have from the sublime to the ridiculous ,COMMA but they worked .PERIOD 
this is an inflatable hemp house .PERIOD it was built ;SEMICOLON it works .PERIOD 
this is a shipping container .PERIOD built and works .PERIOD 
and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building ,COMMA but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks .PERIOD 
so we've engaged not just designers ,COMMA but also ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a whole variety of technology-based professionals .PERIOD 
using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes .PERIOD 
using straw bale construction ,COMMA creating heat walls .PERIOD 
and then something remarkable happened in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
we went to africa ,COMMA originally to look at the housing issue .PERIOD 
within three days ,COMMA we realized the problem was not housing ;SEMICOLON it was the growing pandemic of hiv/aids .PERIOD 
and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> kilometers to see doctors ,COMMA you get the doctors to the people .PERIOD 
and we started engaging the medical community .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we thought we were real bright ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sparks -- we've come up with this great idea ,COMMA mobile health clinics widely distributed throughout sub-saharan africa .PERIOD 
and the community ,COMMA the medical community there said ,COMMA we've said this for the last decade .PERIOD we know this .PERIOD 
so in a way ,COMMA we had taken a pre-existing need and shown solutions .PERIOD 
and so again ,COMMA we had a whole variety of ideas that came in .PERIOD 
this one i personally love ,COMMA because the idea that architecture is not just about solutions ,COMMA but about raising awareness .PERIOD 
this is a kenaf clinic .PERIOD you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land ,COMMA and then once -- and it grows <NUM> feet in a month .PERIOD 
so it's dealing with the fact that if you have aids ,COMMA you also need to have nutrition rates ,COMMA and the idea that the idea of nutrition is as important as getting anti-retrovirals out there .PERIOD 
so you know ,COMMA this is a serious solution .PERIOD 
this one i love .PERIOD the idea is it's not just a clinic -- it's a community center .PERIOD 
this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community ,COMMA so it can be a self-sustaining project .PERIOD 
every one of these projects is sustainable .PERIOD 
that's not because i'm a tree-hugging green person .PERIOD 
it's because when you live on four dollars a day ,COMMA you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable .PERIOD 
you have to know where your energy is coming from .PERIOD 
you have to know where your resource is coming from .PERIOD 
so this is about getting an economic engine ,COMMA and then at night it turns into a movie theater .PERIOD 
so it's not an aids clinic .PERIOD it's a community center .PERIOD 
so you can see ideas .PERIOD and these ideas developed into prototypes ,COMMA and they were eventually built .PERIOD and currently ,COMMA as of this year ,COMMA there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and kenya .PERIOD 
from that we also developed siyathemba ,COMMA which was a project -- the community came to us and said ,COMMA the problem is that the girls don't have education .PERIOD 
and we're working in an area where young women between the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> have a <NUM> percent hiv/aids rate .PERIOD 
and that's not because they're promiscuous ,COMMA it's because there's no knowledge .PERIOD 
so that there would be a very slow way of developing kind of confidence in health care .PERIOD 
and we picked nine finalists ,COMMA and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region ,COMMA and then the community picked their design .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA this is our design ,COMMA because it's not only about engaging a community ;SEMICOLON it's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process .PERIOD 
so the winning design is here ,COMMA and then of course ,COMMA we actually go and work with the community and the clients .PERIOD 
i'm a consultant and i'm also the national football player for south africa ,COMMA bafana bafana ,COMMA and i also play in the vodacom league for the team called tembisa ,COMMA which has now changed to siyathemba .PERIOD 
this is our home ground .PERIOD 
cameron sinclair :COLON so i'm going to show that later because i'm running out of time .PERIOD 
i can see chris looking at me slyly .PERIOD 
and we met ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a couple of months ago .PERIOD we've already developed a design ,COMMA and the team is over there ,COMMA working in partnership .PERIOD 
this was a matchmaking thanks to a couple of tedsters :COLON [unclear] cheryl heller and andrew zolli ,COMMA who connected me with this amazing african woman .PERIOD 
and we start construction in june ,COMMA and it will be opened by tedglobal .PERIOD 
so when you come to tedglobal ,COMMA you can check it out .PERIOD 
but what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development ,COMMA and we've been involved in a lot of issues ,COMMA such as the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina .PERIOD 
this is a community-designed community center .PERIOD 
and what that means is we actually live and work with the community ,COMMA and they're part of the design process .PERIOD 
the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be ,COMMA and then eventually ,COMMA the community is actually ,COMMA through skills training ,COMMA end up building the building with us .PERIOD 
here is another school .PERIOD 
this is what the un .PERIOD gave these guys for six months -- <NUM> plastic tarps .PERIOD 
this was in august .PERIOD this was the replacement ,COMMA and it's supposed to last for two years .PERIOD 
when the rain comes down ,COMMA you can't hear a thing ,COMMA and in the summer it's about <NUM> degrees inside .PERIOD 
so we said ,COMMA if the rain's coming down ,COMMA let's get fresh water .PERIOD 
so every one of our schools have rain water collection systems ,COMMA very low cost .PERIOD 
a class ,COMMA three classrooms and rainwater collection is <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
this was raised by hot chocolate sales in atlanta .PERIOD 
it's built by the parents of the kids .PERIOD 
the kids are out there on-site ,COMMA building the buildings .PERIOD 
and it opened a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and there's <NUM> kids that are now using the schools .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA disaster hits home .PERIOD 
we see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that ,COMMA but we don't see the good stories .PERIOD 
here is a community that got together and they said no to waiting .PERIOD 
they formed a partnership ,COMMA a diverse partnership of players to actually map out east biloxi ,COMMA to figure out who is getting involved .PERIOD 
we've had over <NUM> volunteers rebuilding ,COMMA rehabbing homes .PERIOD 
figuring out what fema regulations are ,COMMA not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild .PERIOD 
working with residents ,COMMA getting them out of their homes ,COMMA so they don't get ill .PERIOD this is what they're cleaning up on their own .PERIOD 
this is a rehabbed home ,COMMA done in four days .PERIOD 
this is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker .PERIOD 
she's <NUM> years old .PERIOD this is what fema gave her .PERIOD 
<NUM> bucks ,COMMA happened two days ago .PERIOD 
it's built ;SEMICOLON it's running and she just started a business today ,COMMA where she's washing other peoples clothes .PERIOD 
that was their home ,COMMA and these are the photographs they took .PERIOD 
and we're helping ,COMMA working with them to create a new building .PERIOD 
projects we've done .PERIOD projects we've been a part of ,COMMA support .PERIOD 
why don't aid agencies do this ?QUESTIONMARK this is the un .PERIOD tent .PERIOD 
this is the new un .PERIOD tent ,COMMA just introduced this year .PERIOD 
quick to assemble .PERIOD it's got a flap ,COMMA that's the invention .PERIOD 
it took <NUM> years to design this and get it implemented in the field .PERIOD 
i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD there's a problem here .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA we're not alone .PERIOD 
there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work .PERIOD 
more hemp houses -- it's a theme in japan apparently .PERIOD 
i'm not sure what they're smoking .PERIOD 
this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said ,COMMA all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams .PERIOD 
this guy designed for nasa ,COMMA is now doing housing .PERIOD 
i'm going to whip through this quickly ,COMMA because i know i've got only a couple of minutes .PERIOD 
so this is all done in the last two years .PERIOD 
i showed you something that took <NUM> years to do .PERIOD 
and this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years .PERIOD 
from brazil to india ,COMMA mexico ,COMMA alabama ,COMMA china ,COMMA israel ,COMMA palestine ,COMMA vietnam .PERIOD 
the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is <NUM> -- that's how old i am .PERIOD so it's a young -- i just have to stop here ,COMMA because arup is in the room and this is the best-designed toilet in the world .PERIOD 
if you're ever ,COMMA ever in india ,COMMA go use this toilet .PERIOD 
chris luebkeman will tell you why .PERIOD 
i'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party .PERIOD 
but the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of new york ,COMMA but this .PERIOD and when you look at this ,COMMA you see crisis .PERIOD 
what i see is many ,COMMA many inventors .PERIOD 
we hear about them all the time .PERIOD 
four billion live in growing but fragile economies .PERIOD 
one in seven live in unplanned settlements .PERIOD 
how do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?QUESTIONMARK 
with <NUM> million solutions .PERIOD 
so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON wait a second .PERIOD wait a second .PERIOD that's your wish ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's my wish .PERIOD 
that's his wish !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we started architecture for humanity with <NUM> dollars and a website .PERIOD 
so chris somehow decided to give me <NUM> .PERIOD 
so why not this many people ?QUESTIONMARK 
open-source architecture is the way to go .PERIOD 
you have a diverse community of participants -- and we're not just talking about inventors and designers ,COMMA but we're talking about the funding model .PERIOD 
my role is not as a designer ;SEMICOLON it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world .PERIOD 
and what we need is something that replicates me globally ,COMMA because i haven't slept in seven years .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA what will this thing be ?QUESTIONMARK 
designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis ,COMMA but they don't want some company in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it .PERIOD 
so creative commons has developed the developing nations license .PERIOD 
and what that means is that a designer can -- the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it .PERIOD 
as soon as that is built ,COMMA anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free .PERIOD 
so why not allow designers the opportunity to do this ,COMMA but still protecting their rights here ?QUESTIONMARK 
we want to have a community where you can upload ideas ,COMMA and those ideas can be tested in earthquake ,COMMA in flood ,COMMA in all sorts of austere environments .PERIOD the reason that's important is i don't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works .PERIOD 
that's too late .PERIOD we need to do it now .PERIOD 
so doing that globally .PERIOD 
when you look at the face of an architect ,COMMA most people think a gray-haired white guy .PERIOD 
i don't see that .PERIOD i see the face of the world .PERIOD 
so i want everyone from all over the planet ,COMMA to be able to be a part of this design and development .PERIOD 
and the idea of integrating manufacturers -- fab labs in every country .PERIOD 
when i hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child -- educate every designer in the world .PERIOD put one in every favela ,COMMA every slum settlement ,COMMA because you know what ,COMMA innovation will happen .PERIOD 
and i need to know that .PERIOD it's called the leap-back .PERIOD 
we talk about leapfrog technologies .PERIOD i write with worldchanging ,COMMA and the one thing we've been talking about is ,COMMA i learn more on the ground than i've ever learned here .PERIOD 
so let's take those ideas ,COMMA adapt them and we can use them .PERIOD 
these ideas are supposed to have adaptable ;SEMICOLON they should have the potential for evolution ;SEMICOLON they should be developed by every nation on the world and useful for every nation on the world .PERIOD what will it take ?QUESTIONMARK 
just leave it up there for a sec .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA what will it take ?QUESTIONMARK you guys are smart .PERIOD 
so it's going to take a lot of computing power ,COMMA because i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs ,COMMA but utilize the designs .PERIOD also ,COMMA a process of reviewing the designs .PERIOD 
i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing ,COMMA because those guys are the best in the world .PERIOD plug .PERIOD 
and so you know ,COMMA i want these -- and i just should note ,COMMA i have two laptops and one of them there ,COMMA is there and that has <NUM> designs on it .PERIOD if i drop that laptop ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK 
so it's important to have these proven ideas put up there ,COMMA easy to use ,COMMA easy to get a hold of .PERIOD 
my mom once said ,COMMA there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers .PERIOD 
i'm fed up of talking about making change .PERIOD 
you only make it by doing it .PERIOD 
we've changed fema guidelines .PERIOD we've changed public policy .PERIOD 
we've changed international response -- based on building things .PERIOD 
so for me ,COMMA it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation ,COMMA and that it's free innovation .PERIOD 
think of free culture -- this is free innovation .PERIOD 
somebody said this a couple of years back .PERIOD 
i will give points for those who know it .PERIOD 
i think the man was maybe <NUM> years too early ,COMMA so let's do it .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say ,COMMA i'm a professor ,COMMA their eyes glaze over .PERIOD 
when i go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around ,COMMA they ask me what field i'm in and i say ,COMMA philosophy -- their eyes glaze over .PERIOD 
when i go to a philosopher's party and they ask me what i work on and i say ,COMMA consciousness ,COMMA their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl .PERIOD 
the very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question .PERIOD 
and he says ,COMMA you know ,COMMA philosophers love rational argument .PERIOD 
and he says ,COMMA it seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion ,COMMA and if they don't accept the conclusion ,COMMA they die .PERIOD 
their heads explode .PERIOD the idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents .PERIOD 
but in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all .PERIOD 
it's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness ,COMMA and i finally figured out the reason for that .PERIOD 
the reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness .PERIOD 
we heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games .PERIOD 
they all have an idea for a video game ,COMMA even if they're not experts .PERIOD 
but they don't consider themselves experts on video games ;SEMICOLON they've just got strong opinions .PERIOD 
but they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise .PERIOD 
they're just strongly held opinions .PERIOD 
simply by being conscious ,COMMA i know all about this .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA you tell them your theory and they say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA that's not the way consciousness is !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
no ,COMMA you've got it all wrong .PERIOD 
and they say this with an amazing confidence .PERIOD 
and so what i'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence .PERIOD because i know the feeling -- i can feel it myself .PERIOD 
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are ,COMMA yourselves ,COMMA authoritative about your own consciousness .PERIOD 
that's the order of the day here .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this nice picture shows a thought-balloon ,COMMA a thought-bubble .PERIOD 
i think everybody understands what that means .PERIOD 
that's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .PERIOD 
this is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done .PERIOD 
it's a saul steinberg of course -- it was a new yorker cover .PERIOD 
and this fellow here is looking at the painting by braque .PERIOD 
that reminds him of the word baroque ,COMMA barrack ,COMMA bark ,COMMA poodle ,COMMA suzanne r .PERIOD -- he's off to the races .PERIOD 
there's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along ,COMMA you learn a lot about this man .PERIOD 
what i particularly like about this picture ,COMMA too ,COMMA is that steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style .PERIOD 
which reminds us ,COMMA as rod brooks was saying yesterday :COLON what we are ,COMMA what each of us is -- what you are ,COMMA what i am -- is approximately <NUM> trillion little cellular robots .PERIOD 
that's what we're made of .PERIOD 
not a single one of those cells is conscious ;SEMICOLON not a single one of those cells knows who you are ,COMMA or cares .PERIOD 
somehow ,COMMA we have to explain how when you put together teams ,COMMA armies ,COMMA battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium ,COMMA each one of them -- the result is this .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA just look at it .PERIOD 
how is that possible ?QUESTIONMARK many people just think it isn't possible at all .PERIOD 
they think ,COMMA no ,COMMA there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness .PERIOD 
this is a lovely book by a friend of mine named lee siegel ,COMMA who's a professor of religion ,COMMA actually ,COMMA at the university of hawaii ,COMMA and he's an expert magician ,COMMA and an expert on the street magic of india ,COMMA which is what this book is about ,COMMA net of magic .PERIOD 
and there's a passage in it which i would love to share with you .PERIOD 
it speaks so eloquently to the problem .PERIOD 
'i'm writing a book on magic' i explain ,COMMA and i'm asked ,COMMA 'real magic' by 'real magic' people mean miracles ,COMMA thaumaturgical acts ,COMMA and supernatural powers .PERIOD 
'no' i answer .PERIOD 'conjuring tricks ,COMMA not real magic' 'real magic' in other words ,COMMA refers to the magic that is not real ;SEMICOLON while the magic that is real ,COMMA that can actually be done ,COMMA is not real magic .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness .PERIOD 
real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .PERIOD 
if you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks ,COMMA then it's not real consciousness ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as marvin said ,COMMA and as other people have said ,COMMA consciousness is a bag of tricks .PERIOD 
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when i attempt to explain consciousness .PERIOD 
how many of you here ,COMMA if somebody -- some smart aleck -- starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done ,COMMA you sort of want to block your ears and say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't want to know !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
don't take the thrill of it away .PERIOD i'd rather be mystified .PERIOD 
don't tell me the answer .PERIOD 
a lot of people feel that way about consciousness ,COMMA i've discovered .PERIOD 
and i'm sorry if i impose some clarity ,COMMA some understanding on you .PERIOD 
you'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks .PERIOD 
but i'm not going to explain it all to you .PERIOD 
i'm going to do what philosophers do .PERIOD 
here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .PERIOD 
you know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?QUESTIONMARK 
the philosopher says ,COMMA i'm going to explain to you how that's done .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half .PERIOD 
he merely makes you think that he does .PERIOD 
and you say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA and how does he do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
he says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that's not my department ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD 
so now i'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness .PERIOD 
but i'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is .PERIOD 
this is something ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that lee siegel talks about in his book .PERIOD 
he marvels at how he'll do a magic show ,COMMA and afterwards people will swear they saw him do x ,COMMA y ,COMMA and z .PERIOD he never did those things .PERIOD 
he didn't even try to do those things .PERIOD 
people's memories inflate what they think they saw .PERIOD 
and the same is true of consciousness .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let's see if this will work .PERIOD all right .PERIOD let's just watch this .PERIOD 
watch it carefully .PERIOD 
i'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian named nick deamer ,COMMA and this is a little demo that he's done for me ,COMMA part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .PERIOD 
we're looking for a backer .PERIOD 
it's a feature-length documentary on consciousness .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA you all saw what changed ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?QUESTIONMARK 
every one .PERIOD i'll just show you by running it again .PERIOD 
even when you know that they're all going to change color ,COMMA it's very hard to notice .PERIOD you have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit .PERIOD 
if there's time at the end ,COMMA i'll show you the much more dramatic case .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA how can it be that there are all those changes going on ,COMMA and that we're not aware of them ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA earlier today ,COMMA jeff hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades ,COMMA the way your eye moves around three or four times a second .PERIOD 
he didn't mention the speed .PERIOD your eye is constantly in motion ,COMMA moving around ,COMMA looking at eyes ,COMMA noses ,COMMA elbows ,COMMA looking at interesting things in the world .PERIOD 
and where your eye isn't looking ,COMMA you're remarkably impoverished in your vision .PERIOD 
that's because the foveal part of your eye ,COMMA which is the high-resolution part ,COMMA is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length .PERIOD 
that's the detail part .PERIOD 
it doesn't seem that way ,COMMA does it ?QUESTIONMARK 
it doesn't seem that way ,COMMA but that's the way it is .PERIOD 
you're getting in a lot less information than you think .PERIOD 
here's a completely different effect .PERIOD this is a painting by bellotto .PERIOD 
it's in the museum in north carolina .PERIOD 
bellotto was a student of canaletto's .PERIOD 
and i love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .PERIOD 
and i love canalettos ,COMMA because canaletto has this fantastic detail ,COMMA and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting .PERIOD 
and i started across the hall in north carolina ,COMMA because i thought it was probably a canaletto ,COMMA and would have all that in detail .PERIOD 
and i noticed that on the bridge there ,COMMA there's a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .PERIOD 
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people ,COMMA see their clothes ,COMMA and so forth .PERIOD 
and as i got closer and closer ,COMMA i actually screamed .PERIOD 
i yelled out because when i got closer ,COMMA i found the detail wasn't there at all .PERIOD 
there were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .PERIOD 
the artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things ,COMMA and my brain had taken the suggestion .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA when you get close they're really just blobs of paint .PERIOD 
you will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect .PERIOD 
i'll just give that to you one more time .PERIOD 
when an artful blob of paint or two ,COMMA by an artist ,COMMA suggests a person -- say ,COMMA one of marvin minsky's little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady ?QUESTIONMARK 
the brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there .PERIOD 
you think the detail's there ,COMMA but it isn't there .PERIOD 
it's just making you expect the detail .PERIOD 
let's just do this experiment very quickly .PERIOD 
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye ,COMMA to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many of you rotated the one on the right ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD 
how do you know that's what you did ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over <NUM> years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by roger shepherd ,COMMA who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA it's possible to do that .PERIOD 
but the details of the process are still in significant controversy .PERIOD 
you don't know how you do it .PERIOD 
you just know that you have certain beliefs .PERIOD 
and they come in a certain order ,COMMA at a certain time .PERIOD 
and what explains the fact that that's what you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a figure that i love :COLON bradley ,COMMA petrie ,COMMA and dumais .PERIOD 
you may think that i've cheated ,COMMA that i've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in effect ,COMMA the boundary's really there ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD 
your brain is actually computing that boundary ,COMMA the boundary that goes right there .PERIOD 
but now ,COMMA notice there are two ways of seeing the cube ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a necker cube .PERIOD 
everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD 
can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?QUESTIONMARK 
because there's another way of seeing it .PERIOD 
if you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles ,COMMA some black circles ,COMMA there's another way of seeing it .PERIOD 
as a cube ,COMMA on a black background ,COMMA as seen through a piece of swiss cheese .PERIOD 
can you get it ?QUESTIONMARK how many of you can't get it ?QUESTIONMARK that'll help .PERIOD 
now you can get it .PERIOD these are two very different phenomena .PERIOD 
but there's still a sort of filling in ,COMMA as we can tell if we look at this .PERIOD 
we don't have any trouble seeing the cube ,COMMA but where does the color change ?QUESTIONMARK 
does your brain have to send little painters in there ?QUESTIONMARK 
the purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD 
your brain just lets it go .PERIOD the brain doesn't need to fill that in .PERIOD 
when i first started talking about the bradley ,COMMA petrie ,COMMA dumais example that you just saw -- i'll go back to it ,COMMA this one -- i said that there was no filling-in behind there .PERIOD 
but rob van lier has recently shown that it isn't .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you think you see some pale yellow -- i'll run this a few more times .PERIOD 
look in the gray areas ,COMMA and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD there's nothing there .PERIOD it's no trick .PERIOD 
[failure to detect changes in scenes slide] this is ron rensink's work ,COMMA which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book .PERIOD 
this is change-blindness .PERIOD 
what you're going to see is two pictures ,COMMA one of which is slightly different from the other .PERIOD 
you see here the red roof and the gray roof ,COMMA and in between them there will be a mask ,COMMA which is just a blank screen ,COMMA for about a quarter of a second .PERIOD 
so you'll see the first picture ,COMMA then a mask ,COMMA then the second picture ,COMMA then a mask .PERIOD 
and this will just continue ,COMMA and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA show the original picture for <NUM> milliseconds .PERIOD blank .PERIOD 
show the next picture for <NUM> milliseconds .PERIOD blank .PERIOD 
and keep going ,COMMA until the subject presses the button ,COMMA saying ,COMMA i see the change .PERIOD 
we're going to start easy .PERIOD some examples .PERIOD 
no trouble there .PERIOD 
can everybody see ?QUESTIONMARK all right .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA rensink's subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button .PERIOD 
can you see that one ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
how many don't see it still ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's on the roof of that barn ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's easy .PERIOD 
is it a bridge or a dock ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are a few more really dramatic ones ,COMMA and then i'll close .PERIOD 
i want you to see a few that are particularly striking .PERIOD 
this one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see .PERIOD 
can you see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
dan dennett :COLON see the shadows going back and forth ?QUESTIONMARK pretty big .PERIOD 
i love this one .PERIOD i'll end with this one ,COMMA just because it's such an obvious and important thing .PERIOD 
how many engines on the wing of that boeing ?QUESTIONMARK 
right in the middle of the picture !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
thanks very much for your attention .PERIOD 
what i wanted to show you is that scientists ,COMMA using their from-the-outside ,COMMA third-person methods ,COMMA can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of ,COMMA and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you're not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .PERIOD 
and we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .PERIOD 
jeff hawkins ,COMMA this morning ,COMMA was describing his attempt to get theory ,COMMA and a good ,COMMA big theory ,COMMA into the neuroscience .PERIOD 
and he's right .PERIOD this is a problem .PERIOD 
harvard medical school once -- i was at a talk -- director of the lab said ,COMMA in our lab ,COMMA we have a saying .PERIOD 
if you work on one neuron ,COMMA that's neuroscience .PERIOD 
if you work on two neurons ,COMMA that's psychology .PERIOD 
we have to have more theory ,COMMA and it can come as much from the top down .PERIOD 
my travels to afghanistan began many ,COMMA many years ago on the eastern border of my country ,COMMA my homeland ,COMMA poland .PERIOD 
i was walking through the forests of my grandmother's tales .PERIOD 
a land where every field hides a grave ,COMMA where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century .PERIOD 
behind the destruction ,COMMA i found a soul of places .PERIOD 
i met humble people .PERIOD 
i heard their prayer and ate their bread .PERIOD 
then i have been walking east for <NUM> years -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the caucasus mountains ,COMMA middle east ,COMMA north africa ,COMMA russia .PERIOD 
and i shared their bread and their prayer .PERIOD 
this is why i went to afghanistan .PERIOD 
one day ,COMMA i crossed the bridge over the oxus river .PERIOD 
i was alone on foot .PERIOD 
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .PERIOD 
but he gave me a cup of tea .PERIOD 
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .PERIOD 
so i have been walking and traveling ,COMMA by horses ,COMMA by yak ,COMMA by truck ,COMMA by hitchhiking ,COMMA from iran's border to the bottom ,COMMA to the edge of the wakhan corridor .PERIOD 
and in this way i could find noor ,COMMA the hidden light of afghanistan .PERIOD 
my only weapon was my notebook and my leica .PERIOD 
i heard prayers of the sufi -- humble muslims ,COMMA hated by the taliban .PERIOD 
hidden river ,COMMA interconnected with the mysticism from gibraltar to india .PERIOD 
what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect ,COMMA about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ?QUESTIONMARK 
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul <NUM> years after the beginning of our war .PERIOD 
these are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for afghan businessmen .PERIOD 
clothed in this nylon bag ,COMMA made in china ,COMMA with the name of burqa .PERIOD 
i saw one day ,COMMA the largest school in afghanistan ,COMMA a girls' school .PERIOD 
<NUM> girls studying here in the rooms underground ,COMMA full of scorpions .PERIOD 
and their love [for studying] was so big that i cried .PERIOD 
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?QUESTIONMARK 
the region is not secure ,COMMA but full of the taliban ,COMMA and they did it .PERIOD 
my aim is to give a voice to the silent people ,COMMA to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game ,COMMA the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA can we dare to be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA the real question to pose is not ,COMMA can we be optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's ,COMMA how can we give credible hope to that billion people ?QUESTIONMARK 
that ,COMMA to my mind ,COMMA is the fundamental challenge now of development .PERIOD 
what i'm going to offer you is a recipe ,COMMA a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good ,COMMA which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest .PERIOD 
compassion ,COMMA because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope .PERIOD 
that is a human tragedy .PERIOD 
enlightened self-interest ,COMMA because if that economic divergence continues for another <NUM> years ,COMMA combined with social integration globally ,COMMA it will build a nightmare for our children .PERIOD 
we need compassion to get ourselves started ,COMMA and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious .PERIOD 
that's the alliance that changes the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion ?QUESTIONMARK 
what can we actually do ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA a good guide is to think ,COMMA what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
that gives us ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA quite a good clue ,COMMA except you have to go back quite a long time .PERIOD 
the rich world was you ,COMMA america ,COMMA and the region that needed to be developed was my world ,COMMA europe .PERIOD 
that was post-war europe .PERIOD 
why did america get serious ?QUESTIONMARK 
it wasn't just compassion for europe ,COMMA though there was that .PERIOD 
it was that you knew you had to ,COMMA because ,COMMA in the late 1940s ,COMMA country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc ,COMMA and so you knew you'd no choice .PERIOD 
europe had to be dragged into economic development .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what did you do ,COMMA last time you got serious ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA yes ,COMMA you had a big aid program .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
that was marshall aid :COLON we need to do it again .PERIOD aid is part of the solution .PERIOD 
but what else did you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you tore up your trade policy ,COMMA and totally reversed it .PERIOD 
before the war ,COMMA america had been highly protectionist .PERIOD 
after the war ,COMMA you opened your markets to europe ,COMMA you dragged europe into the then-global economy ,COMMA which was your economy ,COMMA and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA total reversal of trade policy .PERIOD 
did you do anything else ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA you totally reversed your security policy .PERIOD 
before the war ,COMMA your security policy had been isolationist .PERIOD 
after the war ,COMMA you tear that up ,COMMA you put <NUM> troops in europe for over <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA total reversal of security policy .PERIOD anything else ?QUESTIONMARK 
before the war ,COMMA you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you weren't even willing to join the league of nations .PERIOD 
after the war ,COMMA you found the united nations ,COMMA you found the organization for economic cooperation and development ,COMMA you found the imf ,COMMA you encouraged europe to create the european community -- all systems for mutual government support .PERIOD 
that is still the waterfront of effective policies :COLON aid ,COMMA trade ,COMMA security ,COMMA governments .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA the details of policy are going to be different ,COMMA because the challenge is different .PERIOD 
it's not rebuilding europe ,COMMA it's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion ,COMMA so that they actually catch up .PERIOD 
is that easier or harder ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA today i'm going to take just one of those four .PERIOD 
i'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest ,COMMA the one that's just motherhood and apple pie -- governments ,COMMA mutual systems of support for governments -- and i'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance ,COMMA and i'm going to show you that that is enormously important now .PERIOD 
the opportunity we're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion ,COMMA and that is the commodity booms .PERIOD 
partly ,COMMA they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high ,COMMA but it's not just that .PERIOD there's also a range of new discoveries .PERIOD 
uganda has just discovered oil ,COMMA in about the most disastrous location on earth ;SEMICOLON ghana has discovered oil ;SEMICOLON guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground .PERIOD 
between them ,COMMA these new revenue flows dwarf aid .PERIOD 
the entire aid flows to the <NUM> countries of the bottom billion last year were <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent .PERIOD 
so there's the optimism .PERIOD 
the question is ,COMMA how is it going to help their development ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a huge opportunity for transformational development .PERIOD 
will it be taken ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports ,COMMA and the growth of commodity-exporting countries .PERIOD 
and i've looked globally ,COMMA i've taken all the countries in the world for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA and looked to see what the relationship is .PERIOD 
and the short run -- say ,COMMA the first five to seven years -- is just great .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it's hunky dory :COLON everything goes up .PERIOD 
you get more money because your terms of trade have improved ,COMMA but also that drives up output across the board .PERIOD 
so gdp goes up a lot -- fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK that's the short run .PERIOD 
and how about the long run ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the short run ,COMMA it's hunky dory ,COMMA but the long run ,COMMA it's humpty dumpty .PERIOD 
you go up in the short run ,COMMA but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all .PERIOD 
that is not a forecast about how commodity prices go ;SEMICOLON it's a forecast of the consequences ,COMMA the long-term consequences ,COMMA for growth of an increase in prices .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what goes wrong ?QUESTIONMARK why is there this resource curse ,COMMA as it's called ?QUESTIONMARK 
and again ,COMMA i've looked at that ,COMMA and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance ,COMMA the initial level of economic governance ,COMMA when the resource booms accrue .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if you've got good enough governance ,COMMA there is no resource boom .PERIOD 
you go up in the short term ,COMMA and then you go up even more in the long term .PERIOD 
that's norway ,COMMA the richest country in europe .PERIOD it's australia .PERIOD it's canada .PERIOD 
the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance .PERIOD 
they still go up in the short run .PERIOD 
that's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment .PERIOD 
the best growth rates they've had -- ever .PERIOD 
and the question is whether the short run will persist .PERIOD 
and with bad governance historically ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA it hasn't .PERIOD 
it's countries like nigeria ,COMMA which are worse off than if they'd never had oil .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term ,COMMA and below which you go down .PERIOD 
just to benchmark that threshold ,COMMA it's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA are the bottom billion above or below that threshold ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s ,COMMA and that is the spread of democracy .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion .PERIOD 
maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i looked .PERIOD democracy does have significant effects -- and unfortunately ,COMMA they're adverse .PERIOD 
democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies .PERIOD 
at that stage i just wanted to abandon the research ,COMMA but -- -- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that .PERIOD 
because there are two distinct aspects of democracy :COLON there's electoral competition ,COMMA which determines how you acquire power ,COMMA and there are checks and balances ,COMMA which determine how you use power .PERIOD 
it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that's doing the damage with democracy ,COMMA whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .PERIOD 
they haven't got them .PERIOD 
they got instant democracy in the 1990s :COLON elections without checks and balances .PERIOD 
how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances ?QUESTIONMARK 
in all the societies of the bottom billion ,COMMA there are intense struggles to do just that .PERIOD 
the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards ,COMMA which will be voluntary ,COMMA but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues .PERIOD 
we know these international standards work because we've already got one .PERIOD 
it's called the extractive industries transparency initiative .PERIOD 
that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have .PERIOD 
no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it ,COMMA pushed it and published the revenues in the paper .PERIOD 
nigerian newspapers circulations spiked .PERIOD 
people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we know it works .PERIOD what would the content be of these international standards ?QUESTIONMARK 
i can't go through all of them ,COMMA but i'll give you an example .PERIOD 
the first is how to take the resources out of the ground -- the economic processes ,COMMA taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground .PERIOD 
and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction .PERIOD 
and that's great for the company ,COMMA and it's quite often great for the minister -- -- and it's not great for their country .PERIOD 
there's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that ,COMMA and it's called verified auctions .PERIOD 
the public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury -- that is ,COMMA the british treasury .PERIOD 
and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third-generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth .PERIOD 
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .PERIOD 
just in time ,COMMA a set of economists got there and said ,COMMA why not try an auction ?QUESTIONMARK it'll reveal the value .PERIOD 
it went for <NUM> billion pounds through auction .PERIOD 
if the british treasury can be out by a factor of <NUM> ,COMMA think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like .PERIOD 
when i put that to the president of sierra leone ,COMMA the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions .PERIOD 
there are five such decision points ;SEMICOLON each one needs an international standard .PERIOD 
if we could do it ,COMMA we would change the world .PERIOD 
we would be helping the reformers in these societies ,COMMA who are struggling for change .PERIOD 
that's our modest role .PERIOD we cannot change these societies ,COMMA but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing ,COMMA because the odds are so stacked against them .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA we've not got these rules .PERIOD 
if you think about it ,COMMA the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing .PERIOD 
why on earth are they not there ?QUESTIONMARK 
i realized that the reason they're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies ,COMMA politicians will get away with gestures .PERIOD 
that unless we have an informed society ,COMMA what politicians do ,COMMA especially in relation to africa ,COMMA is gestures :COLON things that look good ,COMMA but don't work .PERIOD 
and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry .PERIOD 
that's why i broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist ,COMMA and i wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA i have to say ,COMMA the process of communication does not come naturally to me .PERIOD 
this is why i'm on this stage ,COMMA but it's alarming .PERIOD 
i grew up in a culture of self-effacement .PERIOD 
my wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks ,COMMA and the blog comment said ,COMMA collier is not charismatic -- -- but his arguments are compelling .PERIOD 
if you agree with that sentiment ,COMMA and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry ,COMMA you will realize that i need you .PERIOD 
please ,COMMA become ambassadors .PERIOD 
this story is about taking imagination seriously .PERIOD 
fourteen years ago ,COMMA i first encountered this ordinary material ,COMMA fishnet ,COMMA used the same way for centuries .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA i'm using it to create permanent ,COMMA billowing ,COMMA voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .PERIOD 
i went off on my own to become an artist ,COMMA and i painted for <NUM> years ,COMMA when i was offered a fulbright to india .PERIOD 
promising to give exhibitions of paintings ,COMMA i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram .PERIOD 
the deadline for the show arrived -- my paints didn't .PERIOD 
i had to do something .PERIOD 
this fishing village was famous for sculpture .PERIOD 
so i tried bronze casting .PERIOD 
but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive .PERIOD 
i went for a walk on the beach ,COMMA watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .PERIOD 
i'd seen it every day ,COMMA but this time i saw it differently -- a new approach to sculpture ,COMMA a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials .PERIOD 
my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .PERIOD 
we hoisted them on poles to photograph .PERIOD 
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns .PERIOD 
i was mesmerized .PERIOD 
i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans ,COMMA next in lithuania with lace makers .PERIOD 
i liked the fine detail it gave my work ,COMMA but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .PERIOD 
thousands of people saw it ,COMMA and one of them was the urbanist manual sola-morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto ,COMMA portugal .PERIOD 
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .PERIOD 
i didn't know if i could do that and preserve my art .PERIOD 
durable ,COMMA engineered ,COMMA permanent -- those are in opposition to idiosyncratic ,COMMA delicate and ephemeral .PERIOD 
for two years ,COMMA i searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays ,COMMA salt ,COMMA air ,COMMA pollution ,COMMA and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind .PERIOD 
we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle .PERIOD 
so we raised this 45000-pound steel ring .PERIOD 
we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds .PERIOD 
but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving .PERIOD 
i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america's cup racing yachts named peter heppel .PERIOD 
he helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement .PERIOD 
i couldn't build this the way i knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane .PERIOD 
so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory ,COMMA learned the variables of their machines ,COMMA and figured out a way to make lace with them .PERIOD 
there was no language to translate this ancient ,COMMA idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce .PERIOD 
so we had to create one .PERIOD 
three years and two children later ,COMMA we raised this 50000-square-foot lace net .PERIOD 
it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built ,COMMA permanent and had lost nothing in translation .PERIOD 
this intersection had been bland and anonymous .PERIOD 
now it had a sense of place .PERIOD 
i walked underneath it for the first time .PERIOD 
as i watched the wind's choreography unfold ,COMMA i felt sheltered and ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA connected to limitless sky .PERIOD 
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .PERIOD 
i'm going to share two directions that are new in my work .PERIOD 
historic philadelphia city hall :COLON its plaza ,COMMA i felt ,COMMA needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting .PERIOD 
so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing ,COMMA discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet .PERIOD 
i'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an x-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding .PERIOD 
i didn't know where to begin ,COMMA but i said yes .PERIOD 
it shifted the earth's tectonic plates ,COMMA sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day .PERIOD 
so i contacted noaa ,COMMA and i asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami ,COMMA and translated it into this .PERIOD 
its title :COLON <NUM> refers to the number of microseconds that the earth's day was shortened .PERIOD 
i couldn't build this with a steel ring ,COMMA the way i knew .PERIOD 
its shape was too complex now .PERIOD 
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft ,COMMA fine mesh of a fiber <NUM> times stronger than steel .PERIOD 
the sculpture could now be entirely soft ,COMMA which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .PERIOD 
there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity .PERIOD 
so we had to create it .PERIOD 
then i got a call from new york city asking if i could adapt these concepts to times square or the high line .PERIOD 
this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers .PERIOD 
they don't have funding yet ,COMMA but i dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed .PERIOD 
fourteen years ago ,COMMA i searched for beauty in the traditional things ,COMMA in craft forms .PERIOD 
now i combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous ,COMMA billowing forms the scale of buildings .PERIOD 
my artistic horizons continue to grow .PERIOD 
i'll leave you with this story .PERIOD 
i got a call from a friend in phoenix .PERIOD 
an attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art ,COMMA never visited the local art museum ,COMMA dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture .PERIOD 
there they were in their business suits ,COMMA laying in the grass ,COMMA noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know ,COMMA sharing the rediscovery of wonder .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
and i worked in mines .PERIOD and i realized that this was a world unseen .PERIOD 
and i wanted ,COMMA through color and large format cameras and very large prints ,COMMA to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape ,COMMA how we use the land .PERIOD 
and to me this was a key component that somehow ,COMMA through this medium of photography ,COMMA which allows us to contemplate these landscapes ,COMMA that i thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work .PERIOD 
and after <NUM> years of photographing large industrial landscapes ,COMMA it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed .PERIOD 
because that is what has changed ,COMMA is the speed at which we're taking all our resources .PERIOD 
and so then i went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil .PERIOD 
and what i want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction ,COMMA where we're taking it from the ground ,COMMA refinement .PERIOD and that's one chapter .PERIOD 
the other chapter that i wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our motorcultures ,COMMA where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration .PERIOD 
and then the third one is this idea of the end of oil ,COMMA this entropic end ,COMMA where all of our parts of cars ,COMMA our tires ,COMMA oil filters ,COMMA helicopters ,COMMA planes -- where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up ?QUESTIONMARK 
and to me ,COMMA again ,COMMA photography was a way in which i could explore and research the world ,COMMA and find those places .PERIOD 
and another idea that i had as well ,COMMA that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how much carbon it would take ,COMMA and how much organic material ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was <NUM> metric tons for one liter .PERIOD 
so whenever i fill up my gas ,COMMA i think of that liter ,COMMA and how much carbon .PERIOD 
and i know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton ,COMMA but he did the calculations for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy .PERIOD 
from the photosynthetic growth ,COMMA it would take <NUM> years of that growth to produce what we use ,COMMA the <NUM> billion barrels we use per year .PERIOD 
looking at <NUM> billion per year ,COMMA we look at our two largest suppliers ,COMMA saudi arabia and now canada ,COMMA with its dirty oil .PERIOD 
the whole world ,COMMA at <NUM> trillion estimated reserves ,COMMA only gives us about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's not a question of if ,COMMA but a question of when peak oil will come upon us .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA to me ,COMMA using photography -- and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents ,COMMA our ways of thinking ,COMMA to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time ,COMMA how to deal with our energy crisis .PERIOD 
and i would like to say that ,COMMA on the other side of it ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years from now ,COMMA the children that i have ,COMMA i can look at them and say ,COMMA we did everything we possibly ,COMMA humanly could do ,COMMA to begin to mitigate this ,COMMA what i feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
hi .PERIOD i'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back ,COMMA just the way i am -- kind of a royal wave .PERIOD 
you can mimic what you can see .PERIOD 
you can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .PERIOD 
soon ,COMMA you'll be able to look inside your brain and program ,COMMA control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .PERIOD 
i'm going to tell you about that technology .PERIOD 
people have wanted to look inside the human mind ,COMMA the human brain ,COMMA for thousands of years .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA coming out of the research labs just now ,COMMA for our generation ,COMMA is the possibility to do that .PERIOD 
people envision this as being very difficult .PERIOD 
you had to take a spaceship ,COMMA shrink it down ,COMMA inject it into the bloodstream .PERIOD 
it was terribly dangerous .PERIOD 
you could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .PERIOD 
we're going to fly into my colleague peter's brain .PERIOD 
we're going to do it non-invasively using mri .PERIOD 
we don't have to inject anything .PERIOD we don't need radiation .PERIOD 
we will be able to fly into the anatomy of peter's brain -- literally ,COMMA fly into his body -- but more importantly ,COMMA we can look into his mind .PERIOD 
when peter moves his arm ,COMMA that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of peter's mind taking place .PERIOD 
now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms ,COMMA that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .PERIOD 
what's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .PERIOD 
we've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds ,COMMA and that allows us to let peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner .PERIOD 
he can look at these <NUM> points of activation per second .PERIOD 
if he can see this pattern in his own brain ,COMMA he can learn how to control it .PERIOD 
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain :COLON the therapist's couch ,COMMA pills and the knife .PERIOD 
this is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .PERIOD 
we all know that as we form thoughts ,COMMA they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .PERIOD 
chronic pain is an example .PERIOD if you burn yourself ,COMMA you pull your hand away .PERIOD 
but if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time ,COMMA it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you .PERIOD 
if we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain ,COMMA we can form 3d models and watch in real time the brain process information ,COMMA and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .PERIOD 
so put your arms back up and flex your bicep .PERIOD 
now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .PERIOD 
what you're seeing here is ,COMMA we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .PERIOD 
this may shock you ,COMMA but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time .PERIOD 
they're watching their own brain activation ,COMMA and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain .PERIOD 
they're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .PERIOD 
as they do it ,COMMA in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .PERIOD 
this is an investigational technology ,COMMA but ,COMMA in clinical trials ,COMMA we're seeing a <NUM> to <NUM> percent decrease in chronic pain patients .PERIOD 
this is not the matrix .PERIOD you can only do this to yourself .PERIOD you take control .PERIOD 
i've seen inside my brain .PERIOD you will too ,COMMA soon .PERIOD 
where will we take it ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion .PERIOD 
it's thought that science can help us get what we value ,COMMA but it can never tell us what we ought to value .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA consequently ,COMMA most people -- i think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life :COLON questions like ,COMMA what is worth living for ?QUESTIONMARK 
what constitutes a good life ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values ,COMMA because science deals with facts ,COMMA and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .PERIOD 
it's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .PERIOD 
but i think this is quite clearly untrue .PERIOD 
values are a certain kind of fact .PERIOD 
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .PERIOD 
why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks ?QUESTIONMARK 
why don't we feel compassion for rocks ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's because we don't think rocks can suffer .PERIOD and if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects ,COMMA as indeed we are ,COMMA it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim :COLON this is something that we could be right or wrong about .PERIOD and if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .PERIOD 
and there's no notion ,COMMA no version of human morality and human values that i've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .PERIOD 
even if you get your values from religion ,COMMA even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .PERIOD 
and to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim ,COMMA which ,COMMA of course ,COMMA may or may not be true .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life ,COMMA for human beings ,COMMA we know that there is a continuum of such facts .PERIOD 
and we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic ,COMMA to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .PERIOD 
and we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .PERIOD 
would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?QUESTIONMARK 
probably not .PERIOD 
would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye ,COMMA so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ?QUESTIONMARK probably not .PERIOD 
there are truths to be known about how human communities flourish ,COMMA whether or not we understand these truths .PERIOD 
and morality relates to these truths .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in talking about values we are talking about facts .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .PERIOD 
but if we're going to talk about human well-being we are ,COMMA of necessity ,COMMA talking about the human brain .PERIOD 
because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death .PERIOD 
even if the suicide bomber does get <NUM> virgins in the afterlife ,COMMA in this life ,COMMA his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain .PERIOD 
so the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us ,COMMA as indeed it does ,COMMA it changes us by changing our brains .PERIOD 
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can ,COMMA at least in principle ,COMMA be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience ,COMMA psychology ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .PERIOD 
and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .PERIOD 
and i think of this as kind of a moral landscape ,COMMA with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures ,COMMA both personal and collective .PERIOD 
and one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access ,COMMA that few people access .PERIOD 
and these await our discovery .PERIOD 
perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .PERIOD 
perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me be clear about what i'm not saying .PERIOD i'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space ,COMMA or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .PERIOD 
i don't think ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child ,COMMA or whether we should bomb iran's nuclear facilities ,COMMA or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense .PERIOD 
but if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers ,COMMA whether or not we can find them .PERIOD 
and just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality ,COMMA and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .PERIOD 
and hundreds of thousands of children ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA are subjected to this every year .PERIOD 
the locations of these enlightened districts ,COMMA i think ,COMMA will fail to surprise you .PERIOD 
we're not talking about connecticut .PERIOD 
and the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .PERIOD 
the creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod ,COMMA lest we spoil the child -- this is in proverbs <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA and i believe ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
is there any doubt that this question has an answer ,COMMA and that it matters ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA consider by analogy ,COMMA the concept of physical health .PERIOD 
the concept of physical health is undefined .PERIOD 
as we just heard from michael specter ,COMMA it has changed over the years .PERIOD 
it's now around <NUM> in the developed world .PERIOD 
there may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age <NUM> will be considered a profound disability .PERIOD 
people will send you donations when you're in that condition .PERIOD 
notice that the fact that the concept of health is open ,COMMA genuinely open for revision ,COMMA does not make it vacuous .PERIOD 
the distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .PERIOD 
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape :COLON there may be equivalent ways to thrive ;SEMICOLON there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality ?QUESTIONMARK 
well think of how we talk about food :COLON i would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .PERIOD 
there is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .PERIOD 
but there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .PERIOD 
the fact that there are many right answers to the question ,COMMA what is food ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA if it's really wrong to lie ,COMMA it must always be wrong to lie ,COMMA and if you can find an exception ,COMMA well then there's no such thing as moral truth .PERIOD 
why would we think this ?QUESTIONMARK 
consider ,COMMA by analogy ,COMMA the game of chess .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you're going to play good chess ,COMMA a principle like ,COMMA don't lose your queen ,COMMA is very good to follow .PERIOD 
but it clearly admits some exceptions .PERIOD 
there are moments when losing your queen is a brilliant thing to do .PERIOD 
there are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .PERIOD 
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .PERIOD 
consider the great problem of women's bodies :COLON what to do about them ?QUESTIONMARK 
well this is one thing you can do about them :COLON you can cover them up .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it is the position ,COMMA generally speaking ,COMMA of our intellectual community that while we may not like this ,COMMA we might think of this as wrong in boston or palo alto ,COMMA who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?QUESTIONMARK 
and who are we to say ,COMMA even ,COMMA that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable ,COMMA or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA who are we not to say this ?QUESTIONMARK 
who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want ,COMMA as far as i'm concerned .PERIOD 
what are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA granted ,COMMA for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?QUESTIONMARK 
probably not .PERIOD ok ,COMMA so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .PERIOD 
perhaps there are many such places -- again ,COMMA given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .PERIOD 
but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .PERIOD 
now the irony ,COMMA from my perspective ,COMMA is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .PERIOD 
and of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind ,COMMA not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .PERIOD 
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .PERIOD 
but the demagogues are right about one thing :COLON we need a universal conception of human values .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what stands in the way of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular ,COMMA academic ,COMMA scientist types .PERIOD 
when talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for instance the dalai lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion ,COMMA and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA we have someone like ted bundy ;SEMICOLON ted bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time .PERIOD 
most western intellectuals look at this situation and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's nothing for the dalai lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for ted bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .PERIOD 
he likes chocolate ,COMMA he likes vanilla .PERIOD 
there's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other .PERIOD 
notice that we don't do this in science .PERIOD 
on the left you have edward witten .PERIOD 
he's a string theorist .PERIOD 
if you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around ,COMMA in my experience half of them will say ed witten .PERIOD 
the other half will tell you they don't like the question .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what would happen if i showed up at a physics conference and saidstring theory is bogus .PERIOD 
it doesn't resonate with me .PERIOD it's not how i chose to view the universe at a small scale .PERIOD 
i'm not a fan .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA nothing would happen because i'm not a physicist ;SEMICOLON i don't understand string theory .PERIOD 
i'm the ted bundy of string theory .PERIOD 
i wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .PERIOD 
but this is just the point .PERIOD 
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise .PERIOD 
that is what it is for knowledge to count .PERIOD 
how have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise ,COMMA or moral talent ,COMMA or moral genius even ?QUESTIONMARK 
how have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ?QUESTIONMARK 
how have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?QUESTIONMARK 
does the taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD 
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA this ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is what the world needs now .PERIOD 
it needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing ,COMMA and morality relates to that domain of facts .PERIOD 
it is possible for individuals ,COMMA and even for whole cultures ,COMMA to care about the wrong things ,COMMA which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .PERIOD 
just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .PERIOD 
we live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less ,COMMA and they will one day mean nothing .PERIOD 
we live in a world filled with destructive technology ,COMMA and this technology cannot be uninvented ;SEMICOLON it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .PERIOD 
it seems to me ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads ,COMMA or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .PERIOD 
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .PERIOD 
and to do that ,COMMA we have to admit that these questions have answers .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON so ,COMMA some combustible material there .PERIOD 
whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world ,COMMA hearing some of this ,COMMA may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing ,COMMA after as well ,COMMA some of them .PERIOD 
language seems to be really important here .PERIOD 
when you're talking about the veil ,COMMA you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags .PERIOD 
i've lived in the muslim world ,COMMA spoken with a lot of muslim women .PERIOD 
and some of them would say something else .PERIOD they would say ,COMMA no ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is a celebration of female specialness ,COMMA it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view -- that male lust is not to be trusted .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?QUESTIONMARK 
sam harris :COLON yeah ,COMMA well i think i tried to broach this in a sentence ,COMMA watching the clock ticking ,COMMA but the question is :COLON what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations ,COMMA and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil ,COMMA or a very funny hat ,COMMA or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want ,COMMA but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .PERIOD 
and so i think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it ,COMMA especially when it's <NUM> degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa .PERIOD 
a lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .PERIOD 
but can you reconcile that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think i understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional ,COMMA where we all have to think the same .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail ,COMMA then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion ,COMMA and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they're genetic ,COMMA whether they're how people talk to one another ,COMMA whether they're economic systems ,COMMA and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA everything is not going to be up for grabs .PERIOD 
it's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .PERIOD 
i mean i don't think we need an nsf grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .PERIOD 
do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think there are clearly right answers to that .PERIOD 
and if the results come out that actually they do ,COMMA are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?QUESTIONMARK 
well yeah ,COMMA modulo one obvious fact ,COMMA that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you can say like ,COMMA because i knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend ,COMMA i chopped his head off .PERIOD and that was the most compassionate thing i could do .PERIOD 
if you get all those parts aligned ,COMMA yes i think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .PERIOD 
it's all of us in this together ,COMMA not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .PERIOD 
really an honor .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i'm a bug lover ,COMMA myself -- not from childhood ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA but rather late .PERIOD 
when i bachelored ,COMMA majoring in zoology in tel aviv university ,COMMA i kind of fell in love with bugs .PERIOD 
and then i thought ,COMMA myself ,COMMA how can i be practical or help in the science of entomology ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then i moved to the world of plant protection -- plant protection from insects ,COMMA from bad bugs .PERIOD 
and then within plant protection ,COMMA i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests .PERIOD 
so it's a whole discipline in plant protection that's aiming at the reduction of chemicals .PERIOD 
and biological pest control ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA or these good bugs that we are talking about ,COMMA they've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years ,COMMA for a long ,COMMA long time .PERIOD 
but only in the last <NUM> years people started ,COMMA or people knew more and more how to exploit ,COMMA or how to use ,COMMA this biological control phenomenon ,COMMA or in fact ,COMMA natural control phenomenon ,COMMA to their own needs .PERIOD 
just take a magnifying glass .PERIOD you see what i have here ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's a magnifier times <NUM> .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA times <NUM> .PERIOD 
just open it .PERIOD 
you just twist leaves ,COMMA and you see a whole new world of minute insects ,COMMA or little spiders of one millimeter ,COMMA one and a half ,COMMA two millimeters long ,COMMA and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA in front of this building ,COMMA i'm sure .PERIOD 
just have a look at the plants .PERIOD 
well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples .PERIOD 
what is a pest ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what is the natural enemy ,COMMA the biologically controlled agent ,COMMA or the good bug ,COMMA that we are talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
in general ,COMMA i'm going to talk about insects and spiders ,COMMA or mites ,COMMA let us call them .PERIOD 
let's have a look at that .PERIOD 
here is a pest ,COMMA devastating pest ,COMMA a spider mite ,COMMA because it does a lot of webbing like a spider .PERIOD 
you see the mother in between and two daughters ,COMMA probably on the left and right ,COMMA and a single egg on the right-hand side .PERIOD 
and then you see what kind of damage it can inflict .PERIOD 
they can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking ,COMMA piercing mouthparts of those spiders .PERIOD 
but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider .PERIOD 
this is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA one millimeter ,COMMA two millimeters long ,COMMA not more than that ,COMMA running quickly ,COMMA hunting ,COMMA chasing the spider mites .PERIOD 
and here you can see this lady in action on your left-hand side -- just pierces ,COMMA sucks the body fluids on the left-hand side of the pest mite .PERIOD 
and after five minutes ,COMMA this is what you see :COLON just a typical dead corpse ,COMMA shriveled ,COMMA sucked-out ,COMMA dead corpse of the spider mite ,COMMA and next to it ,COMMA two satiated individuals of predatory mites ,COMMA a mother on the left-hand side ,COMMA a young nymph on the right-hand side .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA a meal for them for <NUM> hours is about five individuals of the spider mites ,COMMA of the bad mites ,COMMA or <NUM> to <NUM> eggs of the pest mites .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA they are hungry always .PERIOD 
and there is another example :COLON aphids .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA with aphids you have only females ,COMMA like amazons .PERIOD 
females giving rise to females giving rise to other females .PERIOD 
no males at all .PERIOD 
parthenogenesis ,COMMA [as it] was so called .PERIOD 
and they are very happy with that ,COMMA apparently .PERIOD 
here we can see the damage .PERIOD 
those aphids secrete some sticky ,COMMA sugary liquid called honeydew ,COMMA and this just globs the upper parts of the plant .PERIOD 
here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus ,COMMA sooty mold ,COMMA which is covering it .PERIOD 
and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp .PERIOD 
here we are not talking about a predator .PERIOD 
here we are talking a parasite -- not a two-legged parasite ,COMMA but an eight-legged parasite ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
this is a parasitic wasp ,COMMA again ,COMMA two millimeters long ,COMMA slender ,COMMA a very quick and sharp flier .PERIOD 
and here you can see this parasite in action ,COMMA like in an acrobatic maneuver .PERIOD 
she stands vis-a-vis in front of the victim at the right-hand side ,COMMA bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg ,COMMA a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA the aphid tries to escape .PERIOD 
she kicks and bites and secretes different liquids ,COMMA but nothing will happen ,COMMA in fact .PERIOD 
only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid .PERIOD 
and after a few days ,COMMA depending upon temperature ,COMMA the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside .PERIOD 
this is not fiction ,COMMA nothing at all .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA in your backyard ,COMMA in your backyard .PERIOD 
but this is the end result .PERIOD 
this is the end result :COLON mummies -- m-u-m-m-y .PERIOD 
this is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out .PERIOD 
the birth is almost complete .PERIOD 
you can see ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA in different movies ,COMMA etc ,COMMA it takes just a few minutes .PERIOD 
and if this is a female ,COMMA she'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short .PERIOD 
this female can live only three to four days ,COMMA and she needs to give rise to around <NUM> eggs .PERIOD 
that means she has <NUM> bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids .PERIOD 
and this is of course not the end of it .PERIOD 
there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA all these weird names -- i didn't bother you with the latin names of these creatures ,COMMA okay ,COMMA just the popular names .PERIOD 
but this is a nice ,COMMA slender ,COMMA very bad pest .PERIOD 
if you can see this ,COMMA sweet peppers .PERIOD 
this is not just an exotic ,COMMA ornamental sweet pepper .PERIOD 
and here comes the natural enemy ,COMMA minute pirate bug ,COMMA minute because it is rather small .PERIOD 
here you can see the adult ,COMMA black ,COMMA and two young ones .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA in action .PERIOD 
this adult pierces the thrips ,COMMA sucking it within just several minutes ,COMMA just going to the other prey ,COMMA continuing all over the place .PERIOD 
and if we spread those minute pirate bugs ,COMMA the good ones ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in a sweet pepper plot ,COMMA they go to the flowers .PERIOD 
and look ,COMMA this flower is flooded with predatory bugs ,COMMA with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones ,COMMA the thrips .PERIOD 
so this is a very positive situation ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
no harm to the developing fruit .PERIOD no harm to the fruit set .PERIOD 
everything is just fine under these circumstances .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest ,COMMA the natural enemy .PERIOD 
what we do is actually this .PERIOD 
in northeast israel ,COMMA in kibbutz sde eliyahu ,COMMA there is a facility that mass-produces those natural enemies .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA what we do there ,COMMA we amplify ,COMMA we amplify the natural control ,COMMA or the biological control phenomenon .PERIOD 
and in <NUM> square meters of state-of-the-art greenhouses ,COMMA there ,COMMA we are mass-producing those predatory mites ,COMMA those minute pirate bugs ,COMMA those parasitic wasps ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and by the way ,COMMA mass-production -- it is not genetic manipulation .PERIOD 
there are no gmos -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever .PERIOD 
we take them from nature ,COMMA and the only thing that we do ,COMMA we give them the optimal conditions ,COMMA under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms ,COMMA in order to proliferate ,COMMA multiply and reproduce .PERIOD 
and that's what we get ,COMMA in fact .PERIOD 
you see under a microscope .PERIOD 
you see in the upper left corner ,COMMA you see a single predatory mite .PERIOD 
and this is the whole bunch of predatory mites .PERIOD 
you see this ampoule .PERIOD you see this one .PERIOD 
i have one gram of those predatory mites .PERIOD 
one gram's <NUM> individuals ,COMMA <NUM> individuals are good enough to control one acre ,COMMA <NUM> square meters ,COMMA of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year .PERIOD 
and we can produce from this ,COMMA believe you me ,COMMA several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis .PERIOD 
so this is what i call amplification of the phenomenon .PERIOD 
and no ,COMMA we do not disrupt the balance .PERIOD 
on the contrary ,COMMA because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals .PERIOD 
that's the whole idea .PERIOD 
and what is the impact ?QUESTIONMARK 
for example ,COMMA in israel ,COMMA where we employ more than <NUM> hectares -- <NUM> dunams in israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the pesticides were actually reduced .PERIOD 
and israeli strawberries ,COMMA even more -- <NUM> percent of the pesticides ,COMMA especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries .PERIOD 
so the impact is very strong .PERIOD 
and there goes the question ,COMMA especially if you ask growers ,COMMA agriculturists :COLON why biological control ?QUESTIONMARK 
why good bugs ?QUESTIONMARK 
by the way ,COMMA the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask .PERIOD 
and if you zoom in ,COMMA you can definitely watch this ,COMMA grandparents with their grandchildren ,COMMA distributing the natural enemies ,COMMA the good bugs ,COMMA instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals .PERIOD 
so safety ,COMMA with respect to the application ,COMMA this is the number one answer that we get from growers ,COMMA why biological control .PERIOD 
number two ,COMMA many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance ,COMMA that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals ,COMMA just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics .PERIOD 
it's the same ,COMMA and it can happen very quickly .PERIOD 
fortunately ,COMMA in either biological control or even natural control ,COMMA resistance is extremely rare .PERIOD 
it hardly happens .PERIOD 
because this is evolution ,COMMA this is the natural ratio ,COMMA unlike resistance ,COMMA which happens in the case of chemicals .PERIOD 
and thirdly ,COMMA public demand .PERIOD 
public demand -- the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals ,COMMA the more growers become aware of the fact they should ,COMMA wherever they can and wherever possible ,COMMA replace the chemical control with biological control .PERIOD 
even here ,COMMA there is another grower ,COMMA you see ,COMMA very interested in the bugs ,COMMA the bad ones and the good ones ,COMMA wearing this magnifier already on her head ,COMMA just walking safely in her crop .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA i want to get actually to my vision ,COMMA or in fact ,COMMA to my dream .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA you see ,COMMA this is the reality .PERIOD 
have a look at the gap .PERIOD 
if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide ,COMMA it's <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world .PERIOD 
i think it's times <NUM> or something like that .PERIOD 
twenty-five billion .PERIOD 
so there is a huge gap to bridge .PERIOD 
so actually ,COMMA how can we do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
how can we bridge ,COMMA or let's say ,COMMA narrow ,COMMA this gap in the course of the years ?QUESTIONMARK 
first of all ,COMMA we need to find more robust ,COMMA good and reliable biological solutions ,COMMA more good bugs that we can either mass-produce or actually conserve in the field .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce .PERIOD 
and thirdly ,COMMA also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .PERIOD 
and this gap really narrows .PERIOD 
so i think my last slide is :COLON all we are saying ,COMMA we can actually sing it :COLON give nature a chance .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i think all of us have been interested ,COMMA at one time or another ,COMMA in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed ,COMMA such as the classic maya in the yucatan ,COMMA the easter islanders ,COMMA the anasazi ,COMMA fertile crescent society ,COMMA angor wat ,COMMA great zimbabwe and so on .PERIOD and within the last decade or two ,COMMA archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses .PERIOD 
but there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse ,COMMA such as japan ,COMMA java ,COMMA tonga and tikopea .PERIOD so evidently ,COMMA societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas .PERIOD 
what about ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor .PERIOD if anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses ,COMMA you know right away that they're an idiot .PERIOD this is a complex subject .PERIOD 
but how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject ?QUESTIONMARK 
in analyzing societal collapses ,COMMA i've arrived at a five-point framework -- a checklist of things that i go through to try and understand collapses .PERIOD and i'll illustrate that five-point framework by the extinction of the greenland norse society .PERIOD 
this is a european society with literate records ,COMMA so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation .PERIOD 
in ad <NUM> vikings went out to greenland ,COMMA settled greenland ,COMMA and around <NUM> they died out -- the society collapsed ,COMMA and every one of them ended up dead .PERIOD 
so they ended up an iron age european society ,COMMA virtually unable to make their own iron .PERIOD a second item on my checklist is climate change .PERIOD climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter .PERIOD 
in the case of the vikings -- in greenland ,COMMA the climate got colder in the late 1300s ,COMMA and especially in the 1400s .PERIOD but a cold climate isn't necessarily fatal ,COMMA because the inuit -- the eskimos inhabiting greenland at the same time -- did better ,COMMA rather than worse ,COMMA with cold climates .PERIOD so why didn't the greenland norse as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
the third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society .PERIOD and if that friendly support is pulled away ,COMMA that may make a society more likely to collapse .PERIOD in the case of the greenland norse ,COMMA they had trade with the mother country -- norway -- and that trade dwindled :COLON partly because norway got weaker ,COMMA partly because of sea ice between greenland and norway .PERIOD 
the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .PERIOD 
in the case of norse greenland ,COMMA the hostiles were the inuit -- the eskimos sharing greenland -- with whom the norse got off to bad relationships .PERIOD and we know that the inuit killed the norse and ,COMMA probably of greater importance ,COMMA may have blocked access to the outer fjords ,COMMA on which the norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA the fifth item on my checklist is the political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems .PERIOD in the case of the greenland norse ,COMMA cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were :COLON their commitments to a christian society investing heavily in cathedrals ;SEMICOLON their being a competitive-ranked chiefly society ;SEMICOLON and their scorn for the inuit ,COMMA from whom they refused to learn .PERIOD so that's how the five-part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the greenland norse .PERIOD 
what about a society today ?QUESTIONMARK 
for the past five years ,COMMA i've been taking my wife and kids to southwestern montana ,COMMA where i worked as a teenager on the hay harvest .PERIOD and montana ,COMMA at first sight ,COMMA seems like the most pristine environment in the united states .PERIOD 
but scratch the surface ,COMMA and montana suffers from serious problems .PERIOD 
going through the same checklist :COLON human environmental impacts ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA acute in montana .PERIOD toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars .PERIOD 
problems from weeds ,COMMA weed control ,COMMA cost montana nearly <NUM> million dollars a year .PERIOD montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization ,COMMA problems of forest management ,COMMA problems of forest fires .PERIOD second item on my checklist :COLON climate change .PERIOD yes -- the climate in montana is getting warmer and drier ,COMMA but montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack ,COMMA and as the snow is melting -- for example ,COMMA as the glaciers in glacier national park are disappearing -- that's bad news for montana irrigation agriculture .PERIOD 
third thing on my checklist :COLON relations with friendlies that can sustain the society .PERIOD in montana today ,COMMA more than half of the income of montana is not earned within montana ,COMMA but is derived from out of state :COLON transfer payments from social security ,COMMA investments and so on -- which makes montana vulnerable to the rest of the united states .PERIOD 
fourth :COLON relations with hostiles .PERIOD montanans have the same problems as do all americans ,COMMA in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies ,COMMA and terrorist attacks .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA last item on my checklist :COLON question of how political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA social ,COMMA cultural attitudes play into this .PERIOD montanans have long-held values ,COMMA which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems .PERIOD 
long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture ,COMMA and to no government regulation ;SEMICOLON values that worked well in the past ,COMMA but they don't seem to be working well today .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies .PERIOD 
are there any general conclusions that arise ?QUESTIONMARK 
in a way ,COMMA just like tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage being different ,COMMA every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details .PERIOD but nevertheless ,COMMA there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today .PERIOD one interesting common thread has to do with ,COMMA in many cases ,COMMA the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak .PERIOD there are many societies that don't wind down gradually ,COMMA but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time ,COMMA within a few decades after their peak ,COMMA they collapse .PERIOD for example ,COMMA the classic lowland maya of the yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s -- literally a few decades after the maya were building their biggest monuments ,COMMA and maya population was greatest .PERIOD 
an analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish .PERIOD 
these rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption ,COMMA or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential .PERIOD 
in a petri dish ,COMMA bacteria grow .PERIOD say they double every generation ,COMMA and five generations before the end the petri dish is <NUM>/16ths empty ,COMMA and then the next generation's <NUM>/4ths empty ,COMMA and the next generation half empty .PERIOD within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty ,COMMA it is full .PERIOD there's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed .PERIOD 
what it means to put it mathematically is that ,COMMA if you're concerned about a society today ,COMMA you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function .PERIOD that's one general theme .PERIOD a second general theme is that there are many ,COMMA often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others .PERIOD many of those factors are not well understood .PERIOD for example ,COMMA why is it that in the pacific ,COMMA of those hundreds of pacific islands ,COMMA why did easter island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation ?QUESTIONMARK 
it turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some ,COMMA rather subtle ones -- that were working against the easter islanders ,COMMA and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra ,COMMA latitude ,COMMA rainfall .PERIOD perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central asia .PERIOD 
easter ,COMMA of all pacific islands ,COMMA has the least input of dust from asia restoring the fertility of its soils .PERIOD but that's a factor that we didn't even appreciate until <NUM> .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA some societies ,COMMA for subtle environmental reasons ,COMMA are more fragile than others .PERIOD and then finally ,COMMA another generalization .PERIOD i'm now teaching a course at ucla ,COMMA to ucla undergraduates ,COMMA on these collapses of societies .PERIOD what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is ,COMMA how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
how could the easter islanders have deforested their environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
what did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree ?QUESTIONMARK 
didn't they see what they were doing ?QUESTIONMARK how could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ?QUESTIONMARK 
it seems incredible in the past .PERIOD in the future ,COMMA it'll seem incredible what we are doing today .PERIOD and so i've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems -- why they fail to perceive the problems or ,COMMA if they perceive them ,COMMA why they fail to tackle them .PERIOD or ,COMMA if they tackle them ,COMMA why do they fail to succeed in solving them ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'll just mention two generalizations in this area .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA among the greenland norse -- a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs .PERIOD and that led the chiefs to do what's called flogging the land :COLON overstocking the land ,COMMA forcing tenant farmers into dependency .PERIOD and that made the chiefs powerful in the short run ,COMMA but led to the society's collapse in the long run .PERIOD 
those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the united states today .PERIOD especially because the decision makers in the united states are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds ,COMMA by drinking bottled water and so on .PERIOD and within the last couple of years ,COMMA it's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short-term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole ,COMMA such as draining a few billion dollars out of enron and other businesses .PERIOD they are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term ,COMMA although bad for society in the long term .PERIOD 
and the other generalization that i want to mention is that it's particularly hard for a society to make quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances .PERIOD for example ,COMMA the greenland norse ,COMMA in this difficult environment ,COMMA were held together for four-and-a-half centuries by their shared commitment to religion ,COMMA and by their strong social cohesion .PERIOD but those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social cohesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the inuit .PERIOD or today -- australia .PERIOD 
one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization for <NUM> years has been their british identity .PERIOD 
but today ,COMMA their commitment to a british identity is serving australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in asia .PERIOD so it's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength .PERIOD 
what's going to be the outcome today ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world ,COMMA time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them ,COMMA not more than <NUM> years ,COMMA and any one of which can do us in ;SEMICOLON the time bombs of water ,COMMA of soil ,COMMA of climate change ,COMMA invasive species ,COMMA the photosynthetic ceiling ,COMMA population problems ,COMMA toxics ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -- listing about <NUM> of them .PERIOD and while these time bombs -- none of them has a fuse beyond <NUM> years ,COMMA and most of them have fuses of a few decades -- some of them ,COMMA in some places ,COMMA have much shorter fuses .PERIOD at the rate at which we're going now ,COMMA the philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years .PERIOD and the solomon islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest ,COMMA which is their major export .PERIOD and that's going to be spectacular for the economy of the solomons .PERIOD people often ask me ,COMMA jared ,COMMA what's the most important thing that we need to do about the world's environmental problems ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my answer is ,COMMA the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA there are a dozen things ,COMMA any one of which could do us in .PERIOD 
and we've got to get them all right ,COMMA because if we solve <NUM> ,COMMA we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble .PERIOD for example ,COMMA if we solve our problems of water and soil and population ,COMMA but don't solve our problems of toxics ,COMMA then we are in trouble .PERIOD 
the fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course ,COMMA which means ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA that it cannot be maintained .PERIOD

the resolution is going to achieve either of two forms :COLON either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action ,COMMA or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely ,COMMA by war ,COMMA disease or starvation .PERIOD but what's for sure is that our non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA since the theme of this session is choices ,COMMA we have a choice .PERIOD does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed ?QUESTIONMARK i draw the reverse conclusion .PERIOD

faux-nostalgia ,COMMA which i'm sort of -- not ,COMMA say ,COMMA famous for ,COMMA but i work an awful lot in it .PERIOD 
it's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened .PERIOD 
somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so i think that’s a case for serious play .PERIOD 
this is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining ,COMMA recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s ,COMMA dining on the wing of a plane .PERIOD you can't see it very well here ,COMMA but that's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away .PERIOD 
this is tank polo in the south hamptons .PERIOD

i would just like to add a crass commercial -- i have a kids' book coming out in the fall called marvel sandwiches ,COMMA a compendium of all the serious play that ever was ,COMMA and it’s going to be available in fine bookstores ,COMMA crummy bookstores ,COMMA tables on the street in october .PERIOD 
so thank you very much .PERIOD 
and i would like to know what the audience is ,COMMA and so who of you ever ate insects ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's quite a lot .PERIOD 
but still ,COMMA you're not representing the overall population of the earth .PERIOD 
because there's <NUM> percent out there that really eats insects .PERIOD 
but this is quite good .PERIOD 
why not eat insects ?QUESTIONMARK well first ,COMMA what are insects ?QUESTIONMARK 
insects are animals that walk around on six legs .PERIOD 
and here you see just a selection .PERIOD 
there's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if we count all the individual organisms ,COMMA we would come at much larger numbers .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA of all animals on earth ,COMMA of all animal species ,COMMA <NUM> percent walks on six legs .PERIOD 
but if we would count all the individuals ,COMMA and we take an average weight of them ,COMMA it would amount to something like <NUM> to <NUM> kilograms for each of you and me on earth .PERIOD 
that means that in terms of biomass ,COMMA insects are more abundant than we are ,COMMA and we're not on a planet of men ,COMMA but we're on a planet of insects .PERIOD 
insects are not only there in nature ,COMMA but they also are involved in our economy ,COMMA usually without us knowing .PERIOD 
it's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the united states for free .PERIOD 
and so i looked up what the economy was paying for the war in iraq in the same year .PERIOD 
it was <NUM> billion us .PERIOD dollars .PERIOD 
well we know that that was not a cheap war .PERIOD 
so insects ,COMMA just for free ,COMMA contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude ,COMMA just for free ,COMMA without everyone knowing .PERIOD 
and not only in the states ,COMMA but in any country ,COMMA in any economy .PERIOD 
what do they do ?QUESTIONMARK 
they remove dung ,COMMA they pollinate our crops .PERIOD 
a third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants .PERIOD 
they control pests ,COMMA and they're food for animals .PERIOD 
they're at the start of food chains .PERIOD 
even larger animals eat insects .PERIOD 
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals ,COMMA still larger animals .PERIOD 
and at the end of the food chain ,COMMA we are eating them as well .PERIOD 
there's quite a lot of people that are eating insects .PERIOD 
and here you see me in a small ,COMMA provincial town in china ,COMMA lijiang -- about two million inhabitants .PERIOD 
if you go out for dinner ,COMMA like in a fish restaurant ,COMMA where you can select which fish you want to eat ,COMMA you can select which insects you would like to eat .PERIOD 
and they prepare it in a wonderful way .PERIOD 
and you can eat something new everyday .PERIOD 
there's more than <NUM> species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe .PERIOD 
that's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we're eating ,COMMA like a cow or a pig or a sheep .PERIOD 
more than <NUM> species -- an enormous variety .PERIOD 
and now you may think ,COMMA okay ,COMMA in this provincial town in china they're doing that ,COMMA but not us .PERIOD 
well we've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally ,COMMA but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects ,COMMA without any exception .PERIOD 
what are you eating ?QUESTIONMARK 
tomato soup ,COMMA peanut butter ,COMMA chocolate ,COMMA noodles -- any processed food that you're eating contains insects ,COMMA because insects are here all around us ,COMMA and when they're out there in nature they're also in our crops .PERIOD 
some fruits get some insect damage .PERIOD 
those are the fruits ,COMMA if they're tomato ,COMMA that go to the tomato soup .PERIOD 
if they don't have any damage ,COMMA they go to the grocery .PERIOD 
and that's your view of a tomato .PERIOD 
but there's tomatoes that end up in a soup ,COMMA and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency ,COMMA there can be all kinds of things in there ,COMMA no problem .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA why would we put these balls in the soup ,COMMA there's meat in there anyway ?QUESTIONMARK 
in fact ,COMMA all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .PERIOD 
so anything is a good protein source already .PERIOD 
now you may say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so we're eating <NUM> grams just by accident .PERIOD 
in a lot of food items that we have -- i have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .PERIOD 
the surimi sticks [of] crabmeat ,COMMA or is being sold as crab meat ,COMMA is white fish that's being dyed with cochineal .PERIOD 
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .PERIOD 
it's being produced in large amounts ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru ,COMMA and it's big business .PERIOD 
one gram of cochineal costs about <NUM> euros .PERIOD 
one gram of gold is <NUM> euros .PERIOD 
so it's a very precious thing that we're using to dye our foods .PERIOD 
the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .PERIOD 
where ,COMMA at the moment ,COMMA we have something between six and seven billion people ,COMMA it will grow to about nine billion in <NUM> .PERIOD 
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed ,COMMA and this is something that worries more and more people .PERIOD 
how are we going to feed this world ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if you look at the figures up there ,COMMA it says that we have a third more mouths to feed ,COMMA but we need an agricultural production increase of <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
and that's especially because this world population is increasing ,COMMA and it's increasing ,COMMA not only in numbers ,COMMA but we're also getting wealthier ,COMMA and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat .PERIOD 
and meat ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production .PERIOD 
our diet consists ,COMMA [in] some part ,COMMA of animal proteins ,COMMA and at the moment ,COMMA most of us here get it from livestock ,COMMA from fish ,COMMA from game .PERIOD 
in the developed world it's on average <NUM> kilograms per person per year ,COMMA which goes up to <NUM> in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries ,COMMA but on average <NUM> kilograms per person per year .PERIOD 
it's <NUM> kilograms per person per year .PERIOD 
but it's increasing enormously .PERIOD 
in china in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA it increased from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA and it's still increasing .PERIOD 
so if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from <NUM> to <NUM> on average ,COMMA and a third of the world population is living in china and in india ,COMMA we're having an enormous demand on meat .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we are not there to say that's only for us ,COMMA it's not for them .PERIOD 
they have the same share that we have .PERIOD 
now to start with ,COMMA i should say that we are eating way too much meat in the western world .PERIOD 
we could do with much ,COMMA much less -- and i know ,COMMA i've been a vegetarian for a long time ,COMMA and you can easily do without anything .PERIOD 
you'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .PERIOD 
but then there's a lot of problems that come with meat production ,COMMA and we're being faced with that more and more often .PERIOD 
the first problem that we're facing is human health .PERIOD 
pigs are quite like us .PERIOD 
they're even models in medicine ,COMMA and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .PERIOD 
that means that pigs also share diseases with us .PERIOD 
and a pig disease ,COMMA a pig virus ,COMMA and a human virus can both proliferate ,COMMA and because of their kind of reproduction ,COMMA they can combine and produce a new virus .PERIOD 
this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak .PERIOD 
you get a new disease that can be deadly .PERIOD 
we eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us that this doesn't happen .PERIOD 
so that's one point for insects .PERIOD 
and there's the conversion factor .PERIOD 
you take <NUM> kilograms of feed ,COMMA you can get one kilogram of beef ,COMMA but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat .PERIOD 
with <NUM> kilograms of input ,COMMA you can get either one or nine kg .PERIOD of output .PERIOD 
so far we're taking the one ,COMMA or up to five kilograms of output .PERIOD 
we're not taking the bonus yet .PERIOD 
we're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .PERIOD 
so that's two points for insects .PERIOD 
and there's the environment .PERIOD 
if we take <NUM> kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef ,COMMA the other nine kilograms are waste ,COMMA and a lot of that is manure .PERIOD 
if you produce insects ,COMMA you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce .PERIOD 
so less waste .PERIOD 
furthermore ,COMMA per kilogram of manure ,COMMA you have much ,COMMA much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure .PERIOD 
so you have less waste ,COMMA and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .PERIOD 
so that's three points for insects .PERIOD 
now there's a big if ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality .PERIOD 
well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein ,COMMA or fat ,COMMA or vitamins ,COMMA it's very good .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment .PERIOD 
and even in terms of calories ,COMMA it is very good .PERIOD 
one kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as <NUM> hot dogs ,COMMA or six big macs .PERIOD 
so that's four points for insects .PERIOD 
i can go on ,COMMA and i could make many more points for insects ,COMMA but time doesn't allow this .PERIOD 
so the question is ,COMMA why not eat insects ?QUESTIONMARK 
we'll have to .PERIOD 
even if you don't like it ,COMMA you'll have to get used to this because at the moment ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .PERIOD 
that's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding ,COMMA but it's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported .PERIOD 
we can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests ,COMMA but there's a limitation very soon .PERIOD 
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by <NUM> percent ,COMMA we're not going to make it that way .PERIOD 
we could much better change from meat ,COMMA from beef ,COMMA to insects .PERIOD 
and then <NUM> percent of the world already eats insects ,COMMA so we are just a minority -- in a country like the uk ,COMMA the usa ,COMMA the netherlands ,COMMA anywhere .PERIOD 
on the left-hand side ,COMMA you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .PERIOD 
on the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .PERIOD 
so people there are eating them ,COMMA not because they're hungry ,COMMA but because they think it's a delicacy .PERIOD 
it's just very good food .PERIOD 
you can vary enormously .PERIOD 
it has many benefits .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA we have delicacy that's very much like this grasshopper :COLON shrimps ,COMMA a delicacy being sold at a high price .PERIOD 
who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are a few people who don't like shrimp ,COMMA but shrimp ,COMMA or crabs ,COMMA or crayfish ,COMMA are very closely related .PERIOD 
they are delicacies .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA a locust is a shrimp of the land ,COMMA and it would make very good into our diet .PERIOD 
so why are we not eating insects yet ?QUESTIONMARK 
well that's just a matter of mindset .PERIOD 
we're not used to it ,COMMA and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .PERIOD 
that's why we're changing the perception of insects .PERIOD 
and i'm working very hard with my colleague ,COMMA arnold van huis ,COMMA in telling people what insects are ,COMMA what magnificent things they are ,COMMA what magnificent jobs they do in nature .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA without insects ,COMMA we would not be here in this room ,COMMA because if the insects die out ,COMMA we will soon die out as well .PERIOD 
if we die out ,COMMA the insects will continue very happily .PERIOD 
so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .PERIOD 
and some might think ,COMMA well they're not yet available .PERIOD 
well they are .PERIOD 
i predict that later this year ,COMMA you'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible ,COMMA but as animal protein in the food .PERIOD 
and maybe by <NUM> ,COMMA you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat .PERIOD 
and they're being made in the most wonderful ways .PERIOD 
a dutch chocolate maker .PERIOD 
so there's even a lot of design to it .PERIOD 
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the eu .PERIOD 
over to the hague recently ,COMMA she went to a high-class restaurant ,COMMA and they ate insects all together .PERIOD 
it's not something that is a hobby of mine .PERIOD 
it's really taken off the ground .PERIOD 
so why not eat insects ?QUESTIONMARK 
you should try it yourself .PERIOD 
a couple of years ago ,COMMA we had <NUM> people all together in a square in wageningen town ,COMMA and they ate insects at the same moment ,COMMA and this was still big ,COMMA big news .PERIOD 
i think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects ,COMMA because it's just a normal way of doing .PERIOD 
so you can try it yourself today ,COMMA and i would say ,COMMA enjoy .PERIOD 
and i'm going to show to bruno some first tries ,COMMA and he can have the first bite .PERIOD 
bruno giussani :COLON look at them first .PERIOD look at them first .PERIOD 
marcel dicke :COLON it's all protein .PERIOD 
that's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually .PERIOD 
and it looks delicious .PERIOD 
they just make it [with] nuts or something .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
allison hunt :COLON my three minutes hasn't started yet ,COMMA has it ?QUESTIONMARK 
chris anderson :COLON no ,COMMA you can't start the three minutes .PERIOD 
oh my god ,COMMA it's harsh up here .PERIOD 
i mean i'm nervous enough as it is .PERIOD 
but i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago .PERIOD 
five weeks ago i had total hip replacement surgery .PERIOD 
do you know that surgery ?QUESTIONMARK 
electric saw ,COMMA power drill ,COMMA totally disgusting unless you're david bolinsky ,COMMA in which case it's all truth and beauty .PERIOD 
sure david ,COMMA if it's not your hip ,COMMA it's truth and beauty .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA i did have a really big epiphany around the situation ,COMMA so chris invited me to tell you about it .PERIOD 
but first you need to know two things about me .PERIOD 
just two things .PERIOD 
i'm canadian ,COMMA and i'm the youngest of seven kids .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA in canada ,COMMA we have that great healthcare system .PERIOD 
that means we get our new hips for free .PERIOD 
and being the youngest of seven ,COMMA i have never been at the front of the line for anything .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
so my hip had been hurting me for years .PERIOD 
i finally went to the doctor ,COMMA which was free .PERIOD 
and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon ,COMMA also free .PERIOD 
finally got to see him after <NUM> months of waiting -- almost a year .PERIOD 
that is what free gets you .PERIOD 
i met the surgeon ,COMMA and he took some free x-rays ,COMMA and i got a good look at them .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA even i could tell my hip was bad ,COMMA and i actually work in marketing .PERIOD 
so he said ,COMMA allison ,COMMA we've got to get you on the table .PERIOD 
i'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait .PERIOD 
<NUM> more months .PERIOD 
i'd already waited <NUM> months ,COMMA and i had to wait <NUM> more months .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's such a long wait that i actually started to even think about it in terms of teds .PERIOD 
i wouldn't have my new hip for this ted .PERIOD 
i wouldn't have my new hip for tedglobal in africa .PERIOD 
i would not have my new hip for ted2008 .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i left his office and i was walking through the hospital ,COMMA and that's when i had my epiphany .PERIOD 
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .PERIOD 
oh yeah .PERIOD 
can i tell you how un-canadian that is ?QUESTIONMARK 
we do not think that way .PERIOD 
we don't talk about it .PERIOD it's not even a consideration .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA when we're traveling abroad ,COMMA it's how we identify fellow canadians .PERIOD 
after you .PERIOD oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD after you .PERIOD 
hey ,COMMA are you from canada ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA me too !EXCLAMATIONMARK hi !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing ,COMMA or gardening .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA no .PERIOD front of the line .PERIOD 
so by now i was walking the lobby ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA that hurt ,COMMA because of my hip ,COMMA and i kind of needed a sign .PERIOD 
and i saw a sign .PERIOD 
in the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said ,COMMA volunteers needed .PERIOD hmm .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA they signed me up immediately .PERIOD 
no reference checks .PERIOD none of the usual background stuff ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
yeah .PERIOD they needed some young blood .PERIOD 
i worked alone .PERIOD 
every friday morning i was at the gift shop .PERIOD 
while ringing in hospital staff's tic tacs ,COMMA i'd casually ask ,COMMA what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
then i'd tell them ,COMMA well ,COMMA i'm getting my hip replaced -- in <NUM> months .PERIOD 
it's gonna be so great when the pain stops .PERIOD ow !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
all the staff got to know the plucky ,COMMA young volunteer .PERIOD 
my next surgeon's appointment was ,COMMA coincidentally ,COMMA right after a shift at the gift shop .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA i had my vest and my identification .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA when he walked in ,COMMA i could just tell that he saw them .PERIOD 
moments later ,COMMA i had a surgery date just weeks away ,COMMA and a big fat prescription for percocet .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm not even ashamed of that .PERIOD 
two reasons .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA i am going to take such good care of this new hip .PERIOD 
but also i intend to stick with the volunteering ,COMMA which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all .PERIOD 
even when a canadian cheats the system ,COMMA they do it in a way that benefits society .PERIOD 
as technology progresses ,COMMA and as it advances ,COMMA many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent ,COMMA make us smarter and more connected to the world .PERIOD 
and what i'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case ,COMMA as progress is simply a word for change ,COMMA and with change you gain something ,COMMA but you also lose something .PERIOD 
and to really illustrate this point ,COMMA what i'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple ,COMMA a very common ,COMMA an everyday question .PERIOD 
and that question is this .PERIOD 
what time is it ?QUESTIONMARK what time is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you glance at your iphone ,COMMA it's so simple to tell the time .PERIOD 
how would you tell the time ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ?QUESTIONMARK 
how would you do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA in the 13th century ,COMMA it was the gadget of the day .PERIOD 
it was the world's first popular computer .PERIOD 
and it was a device that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is a model of the sky .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the different parts of the astrolabe ,COMMA in this particular type ,COMMA the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars .PERIOD 
the plate corresponds to a coordinate system .PERIOD 
and the mater has some scales and puts it all together .PERIOD 
if you were an educated child ,COMMA you would know how to not only use the astrolabe ,COMMA you would also know how to make an astrolabe .PERIOD 
and we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe ,COMMA the first technical manual in the english language ,COMMA was written by geoffrey chaucer .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA that geoffrey chaucer ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA to his little lewis ,COMMA his 11-year-old son .PERIOD 
and in this book ,COMMA little lewis would know the big idea .PERIOD 
and the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection .PERIOD 
and basically ,COMMA the concept is ,COMMA how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat ,COMMA portable ,COMMA two-dimensional surface .PERIOD 
the idea is actually relatively simple .PERIOD 
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe ,COMMA and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere .PERIOD 
each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole ,COMMA onto a flat surface ,COMMA where it is then recorded .PERIOD 
so the north star corresponds to the center of the device .PERIOD 
the ecliptic ,COMMA which is the path of the sun ,COMMA moon ,COMMA and planets correspond to an offset circle .PERIOD 
the bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete .PERIOD 
and the altitude corresponds to the plate system .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection .PERIOD 
the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly .PERIOD 
there is the position of the sun ,COMMA moon and planets on the movable rete .PERIOD 
and then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
so how would you use this device ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA let me first back up for a moment .PERIOD 
this is an astrolabe .PERIOD pretty impressive ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of -- museum of history .PERIOD 
and you can see the different components .PERIOD 
this is the mater ,COMMA the scales on the back .PERIOD 
this is the rete .PERIOD okay .PERIOD do you see that ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's the movable part of the sky .PERIOD 
and in the back you can see a spider web pattern .PERIOD 
and that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky .PERIOD 
this is a rule device .PERIOD and on the back are some other devices ,COMMA measuring tools and scales ,COMMA to be able to make some calculations .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
for my thesis i actually built one of these out of paper .PERIOD 
and it's worth probably about three macbook pros .PERIOD 
but a real one would cost about as much as my house ,COMMA and the house next to it ,COMMA and actually every house on the block ,COMMA on both sides of the street ,COMMA maybe a school thrown in ,COMMA and some -- you know ,COMMA a church .PERIOD 
they are just incredibly expensive .PERIOD 
but let me show you how to work this device .PERIOD 
so let's go to step one .PERIOD 
first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky ,COMMA if you're telling time at night .PERIOD 
and there is a bright star called deneb .PERIOD so let's select deneb .PERIOD 
second ,COMMA is you measure the altitude of deneb .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA step two ,COMMA i hold the device up ,COMMA and then i sight its altitude there so i can see it clearly now .PERIOD 
and then i measure its altitude .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's about <NUM> degrees .PERIOD you can't see it from over there .PERIOD 
deneb is there .PERIOD i can tell .PERIOD 
step four is i then move the rete ,COMMA move the sky ,COMMA so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so when that happens everything lines up .PERIOD 
i have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA it is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA holding a model of the universe in my hands .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA i take a rule ,COMMA and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here .PERIOD 
right .PERIOD so ,COMMA that's how the device is used .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i know what you're thinking :COLON that's a lot of work ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ?QUESTIONMARK 
as you glance at your ipod to just check out the time .PERIOD 
but there is a difference between the two ,COMMA because with your ipod you can tell -- or your iphone ,COMMA you can tell exactly what the time is ,COMMA with precision .PERIOD 
the way little lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky .PERIOD 
he would know where things would fit in the sky .PERIOD 
he would not only know what time it was ,COMMA he would also know where the sun would rise ,COMMA and how it would move across the sky .PERIOD 
and he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in computer graphics and computer user interface design ,COMMA there is a term called affordances .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it .PERIOD 
and what the astrolabe does is it allows us ,COMMA it affords us ,COMMA to connect to the night sky ,COMMA to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's just one use .PERIOD incredible ,COMMA there is probably <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> uses .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there is a text ,COMMA and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer .PERIOD 
on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation .PERIOD 
you can survey with it .PERIOD the city of baghdad was surveyed with it .PERIOD 
it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types .PERIOD 
and it would take a full university course to illustrate it .PERIOD 
astrolabes have an incredible history .PERIOD 
they are over <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
the concept of stereographic projection originated in <NUM> bc .PERIOD 
and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms .PERIOD 
there is portable ones .PERIOD there is large display ones .PERIOD 
and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art .PERIOD 
there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable .PERIOD 
astrolabes ,COMMA like every technology ,COMMA do evolve over time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the earliest retes ,COMMA for example ,COMMA were very simple and primitive .PERIOD 
and advancing retes became cultural emblems .PERIOD 
this is one from oxford .PERIOD 
and i find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical ,COMMA and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical ,COMMA or random sky .PERIOD 
how cool is that ?QUESTIONMARK this is just amazing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA would little lewis have an astrolabe ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were ,COMMA our forebears were ,COMMA years and years ago .PERIOD 
it's just an incredible device .PERIOD 
every technology advances .PERIOD 
every technology is transformed and moved by others .PERIOD 
but what we lose ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky ,COMMA a sense of context .PERIOD 
knowing the sky ,COMMA knowing your relationship with the sky ,COMMA is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's -- i think astrolabes are just remarkable devices .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what can you learn from these devices ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world .PERIOD 
and astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together ,COMMA and also how we connect to the world .PERIOD 
thanks very much .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the first robot to talk about is called strider .PERIOD 
it stands for self-excited tripedal dynamic experimental robot .PERIOD 
it's a robot that has three legs ,COMMA which is inspired by nature .PERIOD 
but have you seen anything in nature ,COMMA an animal that has three legs ?QUESTIONMARK 
probably not .PERIOD so ,COMMA why do i call this a biologically inspired robot ?QUESTIONMARK how would it work ?QUESTIONMARK 
but before that ,COMMA let's look at pop culture .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know hg .PERIOD wells' war of the worlds ,COMMA novel and movie .PERIOD 
and what you see over here is a very popular video game ,COMMA and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize earth .PERIOD 
but my robot ,COMMA strider ,COMMA does not move like this .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is an actual dynamic simulation animation .PERIOD 
it flips its body <NUM> degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that's how it walks .PERIOD but when you look at us human being ,COMMA bipedal walking ,COMMA what you're doing is you're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
what you're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall ,COMMA stand up again ,COMMA swing your leg and catch the fall .PERIOD 
you're using your built-in dynamics ,COMMA the physics of your body ,COMMA just like a pendulum .PERIOD 
we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .PERIOD 
what you're doing is ,COMMA when you stand up ,COMMA potential energy to kinetic energy ,COMMA potential energy to kinetic energy .PERIOD 
it's a constantly falling process .PERIOD 
what you see over here ,COMMA this is what we want to do next .PERIOD 
and it deploys legs -- it looks almost like star wars -- when it lands ,COMMA it absorbs the shock and starts walking .PERIOD 
what you see over here ,COMMA this yellow thing ,COMMA this is not a death ray .PERIOD 
this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall ,COMMA it's <NUM> meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things .PERIOD 
so we have two prototypes .PERIOD 
the first version ,COMMA in the back ,COMMA that's strider i .PERIOD 
the one in front ,COMMA the smaller ,COMMA is strider ii .PERIOD 
the problem that we had with strider i is it was just too heavy in the body .PERIOD we had so many motors ,COMMA you know ,COMMA aligning the joints ,COMMA and those kinds of things .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors ,COMMA and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions .PERIOD 
it's a mechanical solution to a problem ,COMMA instead of using mechatronics .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA with this now the top body is light enough .PERIOD so ,COMMA it's walking in our lab ;SEMICOLON this was the very first successful step .PERIOD 
it's still not perfected -- its coffee falls down -- so we still have a lot of work to do .PERIOD 
the second robot i want to talk about is called impass .PERIOD 
it stands for intelligent mobility platform with actuated spoke system .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's a wheel-leg hybrid robot .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel ,COMMA but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub ;SEMICOLON so ,COMMA it's a wheel-leg hybrid .PERIOD 
we are literally re-inventing the wheel here .PERIOD 
let me demonstrate how it works .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach .PERIOD 
just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet ,COMMA it's trying to walk over a changing terrain ,COMMA a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes .PERIOD 
and just by the tactile information ,COMMA it successfully crosses over these type of terrain .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA when it encounters a very extreme terrain ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot ,COMMA then it switches to a deliberate mode ,COMMA where it uses a laser range finder ,COMMA and camera systems ,COMMA to identify the obstacle and the size ,COMMA and it plans ,COMMA carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility .PERIOD 
you probably haven't seen anything like this out there .PERIOD 
this is a very high mobility robot that we developed called impass .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA isn't that cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you drive your car ,COMMA when you steer your car ,COMMA you use a method called ackermann steering .PERIOD 
the front wheels rotate like this .PERIOD 
for most small wheeled robots ,COMMA they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction .PERIOD 
for impass ,COMMA we can do many ,COMMA many different types of motion .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity .PERIOD 
we just simply change the length of the spoke .PERIOD 
it affects the diameter and then can turn to the left ,COMMA turn to the right .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with impass .PERIOD 
this robot is called climber :COLON cable-suspended limbed intelligent matching behavior robot .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i've been talking to a lot of nasa jpl scientists -- at jpl they are famous for the mars rovers -- and the scientists ,COMMA geologists always tell me that the real interesting science ,COMMA the science-rich sites ,COMMA are always at the cliffs .PERIOD 
but the current rovers cannot get there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is climber .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what it does ,COMMA it has three legs .PERIOD it's probably difficult to see ,COMMA but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot .PERIOD 
and then once it figures that out in real time ,COMMA it calculates the force distribution :COLON how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip .PERIOD 
once it stabilizes that ,COMMA it lifts a foot ,COMMA and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing .PERIOD 
also for search and rescue applications as well .PERIOD 
five years ago i actually worked at nasa jpl during the summer as a faculty fellow .PERIOD 
and they already had a six legged robot called lemur .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is actually based on that .PERIOD this robot is called mars :COLON multi-appendage robotic system .PERIOD so ,COMMA it's a hexapod robot .PERIOD 
we actually have a very interesting payload on there .PERIOD 
the students like to have fun .PERIOD and here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain .PERIOD 
it's trying to walk on the coarse terrain ,COMMA sandy area ,COMMA but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA it does some fun stuff ,COMMA as can imagine .PERIOD 
we get so many visitors visiting our lab .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when the visitors come ,COMMA mars walks up to the computer ,COMMA starts typing hello ,COMMA my name is mars .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA we don't have enough time to go into technical details ,COMMA i'll just show you some of the experiments .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is some of the early feasibility experiments .PERIOD 
we store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move .PERIOD 
or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward .PERIOD it's called chimera .PERIOD 
we also have been working with some scientists and engineers from upenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot .PERIOD 
we do something to something and just like magic ,COMMA it moves .PERIOD the blob .PERIOD 
this robot is a very recent project .PERIOD it's called raphael .PERIOD 
there are a lot of really neat ,COMMA very good robotic hands out there in the market .PERIOD 
the problem is they're just too expensive ,COMMA tens of thousands of dollars .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical ,COMMA because it's not affordable .PERIOD 
instead of using electrical motors ,COMMA electromechanical actuators ,COMMA we're using compressed air .PERIOD 
we developed these novel actuators for joints .PERIOD 
it is compliant .PERIOD you can actually change the force ,COMMA simply just changing the air pressure .PERIOD 
and it can actually crush an empty soda can .PERIOD 
it can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg ,COMMA or in this case ,COMMA a lightbulb .PERIOD 
the best part ,COMMA it took only $200 dollars to make the first prototype .PERIOD 
this robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call hydras ,COMMA hyper degrees-of-freedom robotic articulated serpentine .PERIOD 
this is a robot that can climb structures .PERIOD 
this is a hydras's arm .PERIOD 
it's a <NUM> degrees of freedom robotic arm .PERIOD 
but the cool part is the user interface .PERIOD 
the cable over there ,COMMA that's an optical fiber .PERIOD 
and this student ,COMMA probably the first time using it ,COMMA but she can articulate it many different ways .PERIOD 
it takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm .PERIOD 
in this case it's very intuitive ;SEMICOLON this student ,COMMA probably his first time using it ,COMMA doing very complex manipulation tasks ,COMMA picking up objects and doing manipulation ,COMMA just like that .PERIOD very intuitive .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this robot is currently our star robot .PERIOD 
as you know ,COMMA we are very interested in humanoid robot ,COMMA human walking ,COMMA so we decided to build a small humanoid robot .PERIOD 
this was in <NUM> ;SEMICOLON at that time ,COMMA this was something really ,COMMA really revolutionary .PERIOD 
this was more of a feasibility study :COLON what kind of motors should we use ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it even possible ?QUESTIONMARK what kinds of controls should we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA this does not have any sensors .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's an open loop control .PERIOD 
for those who probably know ,COMMA if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances ,COMMA you know what happens .PERIOD 
it stands up ,COMMA it walks -- very impressive .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA still ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it has a cord ,COMMA umbilical cord .PERIOD so ,COMMA we're still using an external power source and external computation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA now it's really time to have fun .PERIOD 
let's give it intelligence .PERIOD we give it all the computing power it needs :COLON a <NUM> gigahertz pentium m chip ,COMMA two firewire cameras ,COMMA rate gyros ,COMMA accelerometers ,COMMA four force sensors on the foot ,COMMA lithium polymer batteries .PERIOD 
and now darwin ii is completely autonomous .PERIOD 
it is not remote controlled .PERIOD 
there are no tethers .PERIOD it looks around ,COMMA searches for the ball ,COMMA looks around ,COMMA searches for the ball ,COMMA and it tries to play a game of soccer ,COMMA autonomously :COLON artificial intelligence .PERIOD 
let's see how it does .PERIOD this was our very first trial ,COMMA and .PERIOD spectators :COLON goal !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i don't know how many of you have heard about robocup .PERIOD 
it's an international autonomous robot soccer competition .PERIOD 
and the goal of robocup ,COMMA the actual goal is ,COMMA by the year <NUM> we want to have full size ,COMMA autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win .PERIOD 
it's a true actual goal .PERIOD it's a very ambitious goal ,COMMA but we truly believe that we can do it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is last year in china .PERIOD 
this is this year in austria .PERIOD 
you're going to see the action ,COMMA three against three ,COMMA completely autonomous .PERIOD 
there you go .PERIOD yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
the robots track and they team play amongst themselves .PERIOD 
it's very impressive .PERIOD it's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition event .PERIOD 
what you see over here ,COMMA this is the beautiful louis vuitton cup trophy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is for the best humanoid ,COMMA and we would like to bring this for the very first time ,COMMA to the united states next year ,COMMA so wish us luck .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
darwin also has a lot of other talents .PERIOD 
last year it actually conducted the roanoke symphony orchestra for the holiday concert .PERIOD 
this is the next generation robot ,COMMA darwin iv ,COMMA but smarter ,COMMA faster ,COMMA stronger .PERIOD 
and it's trying to show off its ability :COLON i'm macho ,COMMA i'm strong .PERIOD 
i can also do some jackie chan-motion ,COMMA martial art movements .PERIOD 
and it walks away .PERIOD so ,COMMA this is darwin iv .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA you'll be able to see it in the lobby .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD so i showed you some of our exciting robots at work .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is the secret of our success ?QUESTIONMARK 
where do we come up with these ideas ?QUESTIONMARK 
we call it the blind driver challenge ,COMMA very exciting .PERIOD 
and many ,COMMA many other robotics projects i want to talk about .PERIOD 
these are just the awards that we won in <NUM> fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA really ,COMMA we have five secrets .PERIOD 
first is :COLON where do we get inspiration ?QUESTIONMARK 
where do we get this spark of imagination ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a true story ,COMMA my personal story .PERIOD 
at night when i go to bed ,COMMA <NUM> - <NUM> am .PERIOD in the morning ,COMMA i lie down ,COMMA close my eyes ,COMMA and i see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around .PERIOD 
and they assemble ,COMMA and they form these kinds of mechanisms .PERIOD 
and then i think ,COMMA ah this is cool .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA right next to my bed i keep a notebook ,COMMA a journal ,COMMA with a special pen that has a light on it ,COMMA led light ,COMMA because i don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i see this ,COMMA scribble everything down ,COMMA draw things ,COMMA and i go to bed .PERIOD 
every day in the morning ,COMMA the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee ,COMMA before i brush my teeth ,COMMA i open my notebook .PERIOD 
many times it's empty ,COMMA sometimes i have something there -- if something's there ,COMMA sometimes it's junk -- but most of the time i can't even read my handwriting .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA <NUM> am in the morning ,COMMA what do you expect ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i need to decipher what i wrote .PERIOD 
but sometimes i see this ingenious idea in there ,COMMA and i have this eureka moment .PERIOD 
i directly run to my home office ,COMMA sit at my computer ,COMMA i type in the ideas ,COMMA i sketch things out and i keep a database of ideas .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when we have these calls for proposals ,COMMA i try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem .PERIOD if there is a match we write a research proposal ,COMMA get the research funding in ,COMMA and that's how we start our research programs .PERIOD 
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .PERIOD 
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?QUESTIONMARK 
at our lab romela ,COMMA the robotics and mechanisms laboratory ,COMMA we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we gather around ,COMMA we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it .PERIOD 
but before we start we set this golden rule .PERIOD 
the rule is :COLON nobody criticizes anybody's ideas .PERIOD 
nobody criticizes any opinion .PERIOD 
this is important ,COMMA because many times students ,COMMA they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA once you do this ,COMMA it is amazing how the students open up .PERIOD 
they have these wacky ,COMMA cool ,COMMA crazy ,COMMA brilliant ideas ,COMMA and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy .PERIOD 
and this is how we develop our ideas .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we're running out of time .PERIOD one more thing i want to talk about is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just a spark of idea and development is not good enough .PERIOD 
there was a great ted moment ,COMMA i think it was sir ken robinson ,COMMA was it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA there are two sides to the story .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition .PERIOD 
if you want to go beyond a tinkering ,COMMA if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that .PERIOD this is where school comes in .PERIOD 
batman ,COMMA fighting against bad guys ,COMMA he has his utility belt ,COMMA he has his grappling hook ,COMMA he has all different kinds of gadgets .PERIOD 
math ,COMMA differential equations .PERIOD 
i have linear algebra ,COMMA science ,COMMA physics ,COMMA even nowadays ,COMMA chemistry and biology ,COMMA as you've seen .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the more tools you have ,COMMA for batman ,COMMA more effective at fighting the bad guys ,COMMA for us ,COMMA more tools to attack these kinds of big problems .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA education is very important .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA it's not about that ,COMMA only about that .PERIOD you also have to work really ,COMMA really hard .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i always tell my students ,COMMA work smart ,COMMA then work hard .PERIOD 
this picture in the back this is <NUM> am .PERIOD in the morning .PERIOD 
i guarantee if you come to your lab at <NUM> - <NUM> am we have students working there ,COMMA not because i tell them to ,COMMA but because we are having too much fun .PERIOD 
which leads to the last topic :COLON do not forget to have fun .PERIOD 
that's really the secret of our success ,COMMA we're having too much fun .PERIOD 
i truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun ,COMMA and that's what we're doing .PERIOD 
there you go .PERIOD thank you so much .PERIOD 
so this is a story of a place that i now call home .PERIOD 
it's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .PERIOD 
so this is bertie county ,COMMA north carolina ,COMMA usa .PERIOD 
to give you an idea of the where :COLON so here's north carolina ,COMMA and if we zoom in ,COMMA bertie county is in the eastern part of the state .PERIOD 
it's about two hours east driving-time from raleigh .PERIOD 
and it's very flat .PERIOD it's very swampy .PERIOD 
it's mostly farmland .PERIOD 
the entire county is home to just <NUM> people ,COMMA and they're very sparsely distributed .PERIOD 
so there's only <NUM> people per square mile ,COMMA which comes down to about <NUM> people per square kilometer .PERIOD 
we've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the american borders .PERIOD 
we know the symptoms .PERIOD 
it's the hollowing out of small towns .PERIOD 
it's downtowns becoming ghost towns .PERIOD 
the brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back .PERIOD 
it's the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban .PERIOD 
and bertie county is no exception to this .PERIOD 
perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with ,COMMA like many communities similar to it ,COMMA is that there's no shared ,COMMA collective investment in the future of rural communities .PERIOD 
only <NUM> percent of all our philanthropic giving in the us .PERIOD right now benefits rural communities ,COMMA and yet <NUM> percent of our population lives there .PERIOD 
so bertie county is not only very rural ;SEMICOLON it's incredibly poor .PERIOD 
it is the poorest county in the state .PERIOD 
it has one in three of its children living in poverty ,COMMA and it's what is referred to as a rural ghetto .PERIOD 
the economy is mostly agricultural .PERIOD 
the biggest crops are cotton and tobacco ,COMMA and we're very proud of our bertie county peanut .PERIOD 
the biggest employer is the purdue chicken processing plant .PERIOD 
the county seat is windsor .PERIOD 
this is like times square of windsor that you're looking at right now .PERIOD 
it's home to only <NUM> people ,COMMA and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years .PERIOD 
you can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- bunn's barbecue being my absolute favorite .PERIOD 
but in the whole county there is no coffee shop ,COMMA there's no internet cafe ,COMMA there's no movie theater ,COMMA there's no bookstore .PERIOD 
there isn't even a walmart .PERIOD 
racially ,COMMA the county is about <NUM> percent african american ,COMMA but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private lawrence academy .PERIOD 
so the public school students are about <NUM> percent african american .PERIOD 
and this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class ,COMMA and you can see the difference is pretty stark .PERIOD 
so to say that the public education system in bertie county is struggling would be a huge understatement .PERIOD 
there's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from ,COMMA and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor's degree or higher .PERIOD 
so there isn't a big legacy in the pride of education .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA two years ago ,COMMA only <NUM> percent of all the third- through eighth-graders were passing the state standard in both english and math .PERIOD 
so it sounds like i'm painting a really bleak picture of this place ,COMMA but i promise there is good news .PERIOD 
the biggest asset ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man :COLON this is dr .PERIOD chip zullinger ,COMMA fondly known as dr .PERIOD z .PERIOD 
and he previously was a superintendent in charleston ,COMMA south carolina and then in denver ,COMMA colorado .PERIOD 
he started some of the country's first charter schools in the late '80s in the us .PERIOD 
and he is an absolute renegade and a visionary ,COMMA and he is the reason that i now live and work there .PERIOD 
and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don't usually have access to design services or creative capital .PERIOD 
specifically ,COMMA we use these six design directives ,COMMA probably the most important being number two :COLON we design with ,COMMA not for -- in that ,COMMA when we're doing humanitarian-focused design ,COMMA it's not about designing for clients anymore .PERIOD 
it's about designing with people ,COMMA and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within .PERIOD 
so at the time of being invited down there ,COMMA we were based in san francisco ,COMMA and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of <NUM> ,COMMA spending about half our time in bertie county .PERIOD 
and when i say we ,COMMA i mean project h ,COMMA but more specifically ,COMMA i mean myself and my partner ,COMMA matthew miller ,COMMA who's an architect and a sort of macgyver-type builder .PERIOD 
so fast-forward to today ,COMMA and we now live there .PERIOD 
i have strategically cut matt's head out of this photo ,COMMA because he would kill me if he knew i was using it because of the sweatsuits .PERIOD 
but this is our front porch .PERIOD we live there .PERIOD 
over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth ,COMMA we realized we had fallen in love with the place .PERIOD 
we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we're able to do in a rural place like bertie county ,COMMA that ,COMMA as designers and builders ,COMMA you can't do everywhere .PERIOD 
there's space to experiment and to weld and to test things .PERIOD 
we have an amazing advocate in dr .PERIOD zullinger .PERIOD 
there's a nobility of real ,COMMA hands-on ,COMMA dirt-under-your-fingernails work .PERIOD 
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .PERIOD 
there isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county .PERIOD 
and so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool ,COMMA something that bertie county didn't otherwise have ,COMMA and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit .PERIOD 
the initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with dr .PERIOD zullinger -- that was why we were there .PERIOD 
but beyond that ,COMMA we recognized that bertie county ,COMMA as a community ,COMMA was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking .PERIOD 
so the goal became ,COMMA yes ,COMMA to apply design within education ,COMMA but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development .PERIOD 
so in order to do this ,COMMA we've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education .PERIOD 
and i should say that these are three things that we've done in bertie county ,COMMA but i feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the us .PERIOD and maybe even beyond .PERIOD 
so the first of the three is design for education .PERIOD 
this is the most kind of direct ,COMMA obvious intersection of the two things .PERIOD 
it's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students .PERIOD 
this is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days .PERIOD 
and so this played out for us in a couple different ways .PERIOD 
the first was a series of renovations of computer labs .PERIOD 
so traditionally ,COMMA the computer labs ,COMMA particularly in an under-performing school like bertie county ,COMMA where they have to benchmark test every other week ,COMMA the computer lab is a kill-and-drill testing facility .PERIOD 
you come in ,COMMA you face the wall ,COMMA you take your test and you leave .PERIOD 
so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology ,COMMA to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging ,COMMA more accessible ,COMMA and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology-based instruction .PERIOD 
so this is the lab at the high school ,COMMA and the principal there is in love with this room .PERIOD 
every time he has visitors ,COMMA it's the first place that he takes them .PERIOD 
and this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape .PERIOD 
so this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called match me .PERIOD 
and in match me ,COMMA you take the class ,COMMA divide it into two teams ,COMMA one team on each side of the playground ,COMMA and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires .PERIOD 
and then she'll call out a math problem -- so let's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is <NUM> and find the tire with the <NUM> on it and sit on it .PERIOD 
so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins .PERIOD 
and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing .PERIOD 
some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores ,COMMA a greater comfort level with the material ,COMMA especially with the boys ,COMMA that in going outside and playing ,COMMA they aren't afraid to take on a double-digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material .PERIOD 
so with design for education ,COMMA i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers ,COMMA so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them .PERIOD 
so this is mr .PERIOD perry .PERIOD he's the assistant superintendent .PERIOD 
he came out for one of our teacher-training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself .PERIOD 
so the second approach is redesigning education itself .PERIOD 
this is the most complex .PERIOD 
it's a systems-level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom .PERIOD 
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change ,COMMA which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities .PERIOD 
so for us ,COMMA this was a graphic public campaign called connect bertie .PERIOD 
there are thousands of these blue dots all over the county .PERIOD 
and this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system .PERIOD 
right now i should say ,COMMA there are only <NUM> percent of the houses that actually have an in-home internet connection .PERIOD 
and the only places to get wifi are in the school buildings ,COMMA or at the bojangles fried chicken joint ,COMMA which i find myself squatting outside of a lot .PERIOD 
aside from ,COMMA you know ,COMMA getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place ,COMMA it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community .PERIOD 
it asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community's development .PERIOD 
and then the third approach ,COMMA which is what i'm most excited about ,COMMA which is where we are now ,COMMA is :COLON design as education .PERIOD 
so design as education means that we could actually teach design within public schools ,COMMA and not design-based learning -- not like let's learn physics by building a rocket ,COMMA but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose .PERIOD 
it also means that designers are no longer consultants ,COMMA but we're teachers ,COMMA and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation .PERIOD 
and what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring ,COMMA rigid ,COMMA verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by .PERIOD 
it's hands-on ,COMMA it's in-your-face ,COMMA it requires an active engagement ,COMMA and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .PERIOD 
so we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically ,COMMA has been something intended for kids who aren't going to go to college .PERIOD 
it's a vocational training path .PERIOD 
it's working-class ;SEMICOLON it's blue-collar .PERIOD 
the projects are things like ,COMMA let's make a birdhouse for your mom for christmas .PERIOD 
and in recent decades ,COMMA a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .PERIOD 
so we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with dr .PERIOD zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one-year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class .PERIOD 
and so this starts in four weeks ,COMMA at the end of the summer ,COMMA and my partner and i ,COMMA matthew and i ,COMMA just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it .PERIOD 
and this is what it looks like .PERIOD 
and during that time ,COMMA they're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding ,COMMA coming back into the studio ,COMMA doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work ,COMMA and then moving into the shop and actually testing them ,COMMA building them ,COMMA prototyping them ,COMMA figuring out if they are going to work and refining that .PERIOD 
and then over the summer ,COMMA they're offered a summer job .PERIOD 
they're paid as employees of project h to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community .PERIOD 
so the first project ,COMMA which will be built next summer ,COMMA is an open-air farmers' market downtown ,COMMA followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year .PERIOD 
so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say ,COMMA i built that ,COMMA and i'm proud of it .PERIOD 
so i want you to meet three of our students .PERIOD 
this is ryan .PERIOD 
she is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
she loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher .PERIOD 
she wants to go to college ,COMMA but she wants to come back to bertie county ,COMMA because that's where her family is from ,COMMA where she calls home ,COMMA and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in .PERIOD 
this is eric .PERIOD he plays for the football team .PERIOD 
he is really into dirtbike racing ,COMMA and he wants to be an architect .PERIOD 
and then this is anthony .PERIOD 
he is <NUM> years old ,COMMA loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands ,COMMA and so for him ,COMMA studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands-on engagement .PERIOD 
he's interested in forestry ,COMMA but he isn't sure ,COMMA so if he ends up not going to college ,COMMA he will have developed some industry-relevant skills .PERIOD 
what design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom .PERIOD 
so this building downtown ,COMMA which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market ,COMMA is now the classroom .PERIOD 
and the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam .PERIOD 
and for the community ,COMMA what design and building offers is real ,COMMA visible ,COMMA built progress .PERIOD 
it's one project per year ,COMMA and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future .PERIOD 
so we recognize that studio h ,COMMA especially in its first year ,COMMA is a small story -- <NUM> students ,COMMA it's two teachers ,COMMA it's one project in one place .PERIOD 
but we feel like this could work in other places .PERIOD 
and i really ,COMMA strongly believe in the power of the small story ,COMMA because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale .PERIOD 
ultimately ,COMMA design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers .PERIOD 
and let's face it ,COMMA designers ,COMMA we need to reinvent ourselves .PERIOD 
we need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter ,COMMA we need to work outside of our comfort zones more ,COMMA and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard .PERIOD 
so while this is a very small story ,COMMA we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
the first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none ,COMMA and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults ,COMMA and there are very ,COMMA very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if you were to be treated ,COMMA you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from rajasthan illustrates .PERIOD 
this is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA her caretakers took her to the village medicine man ,COMMA and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital ,COMMA the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .PERIOD 
the second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists ,COMMA who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age ,COMMA that even if you have your eye corrected ,COMMA the chances of your brain learning how to see are very ,COMMA very slim -- again ,COMMA slim or none .PERIOD 
so when i heard these two things ,COMMA it troubled me deeply ,COMMA both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .PERIOD 
so let me first start with the personal reason .PERIOD 
it'll sound corny ,COMMA but it's sincere .PERIOD 
that's my son ,COMMA darius .PERIOD 
as a new father ,COMMA i have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are ,COMMA what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child .PERIOD 
i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for darius ,COMMA and for me to be told that there might be other dariuses who are not getting treatment ,COMMA that's just viscerally wrong .PERIOD 
so that's the personal reason .PERIOD 
scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age ,COMMA it loses its ability to learn -- that doesn't sit well with me ,COMMA because i don't think that idea has been tested adequately .PERIOD 
the birth of the idea is from david hubel and torsten wiesel's work ,COMMA two researchers who were at harvard ,COMMA and they got the nobel prize in <NUM> for their studies of visual physiology ,COMMA which are remarkably beautiful studies ,COMMA but i believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they did their work with kittens ,COMMA with different kinds of deprivation regiments ,COMMA and those studies ,COMMA which date back to the '60s ,COMMA are now being applied to human children .PERIOD 
one :COLON provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment .PERIOD 
that's the humanitarian mission .PERIOD 
and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .PERIOD 
and these two missions ,COMMA as you can tell ,COMMA thread together perfectly .PERIOD one adds to the other ;SEMICOLON in fact ,COMMA one would be impossible without the other .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA to implement these twin missions ,COMMA a few years ago ,COMMA i launched project prakash .PERIOD 
prakash ,COMMA as many of you know ,COMMA is the sanskrit word for light ,COMMA and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children ,COMMA we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience .PERIOD 
and the logo -- even though it looks extremely irish ,COMMA it's actually derived from the indian symbol of diya ,COMMA an earthen lamp .PERIOD 
the prakash ,COMMA the overall effort has three components :COLON outreach ,COMMA to identify children in need of care ;SEMICOLON medical treatment ;SEMICOLON and in subsequent study .PERIOD 
and i want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work .PERIOD 
this is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind .PERIOD 
pawan sinha :COLON so ,COMMA because this is a school for the blind ,COMMA many children have permanent conditions .PERIOD 
that's a case of microphthalmos ,COMMA which is malformed eyes ,COMMA and that's a permanent condition ;SEMICOLON it cannot be treated .PERIOD 
that's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA every so often ,COMMA we come across children who show some residual vision ,COMMA and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA after that screening ,COMMA we bring the children to the hospital .PERIOD 
that's the hospital we're working with in delhi ,COMMA the schroff charity eye hospital .PERIOD 
it has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center ,COMMA which was made possible in part by a gift from the ronald mcdonald charity .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA eating burgers actually helps .PERIOD 
(text :COLON such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children ,COMMA and . .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD help us find children who can participate in project prakash) ps :COLON so ,COMMA as i zoom in to the eyes of this child ,COMMA you will see the cause of his blindness .PERIOD 
the whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts ,COMMA so opacities of the lens .PERIOD 
in our eyes ,COMMA the lens is clear ,COMMA but in this child ,COMMA the lens has become opaque ,COMMA and therefore he can't see the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the child is given treatment .PERIOD you'll see shots of the eye .PERIOD 
and here's the same child three weeks post-operation ,COMMA with the right eye open .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA even from that little clip ,COMMA you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible ,COMMA and we have now provided treatment to over <NUM> children ,COMMA and the story repeats itself .PERIOD 
after treatment ,COMMA the child gains significant functionality .PERIOD 
we did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right ,COMMA srd ,COMMA and she got her sight late in life ,COMMA and her vision is remarkable at this age .PERIOD 
i should add a tragic postscript to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown ,COMMA but inspiring story .PERIOD 
so when we started finding these results ,COMMA as you might imagine ,COMMA it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press .PERIOD 
here's an article in nature that profiled this work ,COMMA and another one in time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible ,COMMA despite extended visual deprivation .PERIOD 
the next obvious question to ask :COLON what is the process of recovery ?QUESTIONMARK 
the child is provided treatment ,COMMA and i want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional ;SEMICOLON there is no quid pro quo .PERIOD 
we treat many more children then we actually work with .PERIOD 
every child who needs treatment is treated .PERIOD 
after treatment ,COMMA about every week ,COMMA we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .PERIOD 
and we try to do this for as long as possible .PERIOD 
this arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up .PERIOD 
what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?QUESTIONMARK 
the brain has this complex task of putting together ,COMMA integrating ,COMMA subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful ,COMMA into what we would consider to be objects ,COMMA as you see on the right .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight .PERIOD 
here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA and you see ethan myers ,COMMA a graduate student from mit ,COMMA running the experiment with him .PERIOD 
his visual-motor coordination is quite poor ,COMMA but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out .PERIOD 
if you show him real world images ,COMMA if you show others like him real world images ,COMMA they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ;SEMICOLON it's made up of a collage ,COMMA a patchwork ,COMMA of regions of different colors and luminances .PERIOD 
and that's what's indicated in the green outlines .PERIOD 
when you ask them ,COMMA even if you can't name the objects ,COMMA just point to where the objects are ,COMMA these are the regions that they point to .PERIOD 
so the world is this complex patchwork of regions .PERIOD 
even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object .PERIOD 
interestingly enough ,COMMA you give them a few months ,COMMA and this is what happens .PERIOD 
doctor :COLON how many are these ?QUESTIONMARK 
patient :COLON these are two things .PERIOD 
patient :COLON their shapes . .PERIOD 
this one is a circle ,COMMA and this is a square .PERIOD 
a very dramatic transformation has come about .PERIOD 
and the question is :COLON what underlies this transformation ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a profound question ,COMMA and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is .PERIOD 
the answer lies in motion and that's what i want to show you in the next clip .PERIOD 
doctor :COLON what shape do you see here ?QUESTIONMARK 
patient :COLON i can't make it out .PERIOD 
patient :COLON triangle .PERIOD 
doctor :COLON how many things are these ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA how many things are these ?QUESTIONMARK 
patient :COLON two .PERIOD 
doctor :COLON what are these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
patient :COLON a square and a circle .PERIOD 
and we see this pattern over and over again .PERIOD 
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .PERIOD 
so the inference we are deriving from this ,COMMA and several such experiments ,COMMA is that dynamic information processing ,COMMA or motion processing ,COMMA serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ;SEMICOLON it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition .PERIOD 
this simple idea has far reaching implications .PERIOD 
and let me just quickly mention two ,COMMA one ,COMMA drawing from the domain of engineering ,COMMA and one from the clinic .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA from the perspective of engineering ,COMMA we can ask :COLON goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system ,COMMA can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own ,COMMA that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that's what we're trying to do .PERIOD 
i'm at mit ,COMMA at mit you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA don't worry about the internals of dylan .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA i'm just going to talk about how we test dylan .PERIOD 
the way we test dylan is by giving it inputs ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA of the same kind that a baby ,COMMA or a child in project prakash would get .PERIOD 
but for a long time we couldn't quite figure out :COLON wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA could we have darius serve as our babycam carrier ,COMMA and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that's what we did .PERIOD 
i had to have long conversations with my wife .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA pam ,COMMA if you're watching this ,COMMA please forgive me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity .PERIOD 
as some of you might know ,COMMA babyies are born pretty much legally blind .PERIOD 
their acuity -- our acuity is <NUM>/<NUM> ;SEMICOLON babies' acuity is like <NUM>/<NUM> ,COMMA so they are looking at the world in a very ,COMMA very blurry fashion .PERIOD 
thankfully ,COMMA there isn't any audio to go with this .PERIOD 
but then two or three days afterward ,COMMA babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face .PERIOD 
how does that happen ?QUESTIONMARK we want dylan to be able to do that ,COMMA and using this mantra of motion ,COMMA dylan actually can do that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA given that kind of video input ,COMMA with just about six or seven minutes worth of video ,COMMA dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's an important demonstration of the power of motion .PERIOD 
the clinical implication ,COMMA it comes from the domain of autism .PERIOD 
visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers .PERIOD 
when we saw that ,COMMA we asked :COLON could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath ,COMMA of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?QUESTIONMARK 
because ,COMMA if that hypothesis were to be true ,COMMA it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .PERIOD 
what you're going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical ,COMMA one with autism ,COMMA playing pong .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA while the child is playing pong ,COMMA we are tracking where they're looking .PERIOD 
in red are the eye movement traces .PERIOD 
this is the neurotypical child ,COMMA and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go .PERIOD 
contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game .PERIOD 
instead of anticipating ,COMMA the child always follows where the ball has been .PERIOD 
the efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism .PERIOD 
so we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon .PERIOD 
looking ahead ,COMMA if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far ,COMMA this is the magnitude of the problem .PERIOD 
the red dots are the children we have not treated .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there are many ,COMMA many more children who need to be treated ,COMMA and in order to expand the scope of the project ,COMMA we are planning on launching the prakash center for children ,COMMA which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital ,COMMA a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility .PERIOD 
the prakash center will integrate health care ,COMMA education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts .PERIOD 
and for my students and i ,COMMA it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research ,COMMA while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
sheryl shade :COLON hi ,COMMA aimee .PERIOD aimee mullins :COLON hi .PERIOD 
aimee and i thought we'd just talk a little bit ,COMMA and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- i'm a double amputee ,COMMA and i was born without fibulas in both legs .PERIOD 
i was amputated at age one ,COMMA and i've been running like hell ever since ,COMMA all over the place .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA why don't you tell them how you got to georgetown -- why don't we start there ?QUESTIONMARK 
why don't we start there ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm a senior in georgetown in the foreign service program .PERIOD 
i won a full academic scholarship out of high school .PERIOD 
they pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs ,COMMA and so i won a full ride to georgetown and i've been there for four years .PERIOD love it .PERIOD 
when aimee got there ,COMMA she decided that she's ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA curious about track and field ,COMMA so she decided to call someone and start asking about it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA why don't you tell that story ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD well ,COMMA i guess i've always been involved in sports .PERIOD 
i played softball for five years growing up .PERIOD 
i skied competitively throughout high school ,COMMA and i got a little restless in college because i wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise .PERIOD 
and i'd never competed on a disabled level ,COMMA you know -- i'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes .PERIOD 
that's all i'd ever known .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i'd never even met another amputee until i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
and i heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners ,COMMA and i figured ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i don't know about this ,COMMA but before i judge it ,COMMA let me go see what it's all about .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i booked myself a flight to boston in '<NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race .PERIOD i'd never done it before .PERIOD 
i went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far i could run ,COMMA and about <NUM> meters was enough for me ,COMMA panting and heaving .PERIOD 
and i had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound ,COMMA attached with velcro straps -- big ,COMMA thick ,COMMA five-ply wool socks on -- you know ,COMMA not the most comfortable things ,COMMA but all i'd ever known .PERIOD 
and i'm up there in boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they're all looking at me like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we know who's not going to win this race .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i went up there expecting -- i don't know what i was expecting -- but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when i saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump ,COMMA hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet ,COMMA two inches . .PERIOD 
dan o'brien jumped <NUM>'<NUM> in '<NUM> in atlanta ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes ,COMMA without qualifying that word athlete .PERIOD 
and so i decided to give this a shot :COLON heart pounding ,COMMA i ran my first race and i beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second ,COMMA and became the new national record-holder on my first try out .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people said ,COMMA aimee ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you've got speed -- you've got natural speed -- but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track .PERIOD 
you were all over the place .PERIOD 
we all saw how hard you were working .PERIOD 
and so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown .PERIOD 
and i thank god i didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world .PERIOD 
he's coached five olympians ,COMMA and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america certificates of all these athletes he's coached .PERIOD 
he's just a rather intimidating figure .PERIOD 
and i called him up and said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA i ran one race and i won . .PERIOD 
i want to see if i can ,COMMA you know -- i need to just see if i can sit in on some of your practices ,COMMA see what drills you do and whatever .PERIOD 
that's all i wanted -- just two practices .PERIOD 
can i just sit in and see what you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we should meet first ,COMMA before we decide anything .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i met the man ,COMMA walked in his office ,COMMA and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached .PERIOD 
and we got to talking ,COMMA and it turned out to be a great partnership because he'd never coached a disabled athlete ,COMMA so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what i was or wasn't capable of ,COMMA and i'd never been coached before .PERIOD 
so this was like ,COMMA here we go -- let's start on this trip .PERIOD 
so he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break ,COMMA his free time ,COMMA and i would come up to the track and train with him .PERIOD 
so that's how i met frank .PERIOD 
that was fall of '<NUM> .PERIOD but then ,COMMA by the time that winter was rolling around ,COMMA he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you're good enough .PERIOD 
you can run on our women's track team here .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA come on .PERIOD 
you can run with our women's track team .PERIOD 
in the spring of <NUM> ,COMMA with my goal of making the us .PERIOD paralympic team that may coming up full speed ,COMMA i joined the women's track team .PERIOD 
so i don't know ,COMMA it started to become an interesting mix .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA on your way to the olympics ,COMMA a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .PERIOD 
why don't you just tell them ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything i competed in -- and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA training in georgetown and knowing that i was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts -- you know ,COMMA i'm running against the next flo-jo -- and they're all looking at me like ,COMMA hmm ,COMMA what's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what's going on here ?QUESTIONMARK 
and putting on my georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in order to become better -- and i'm already the best in the country -- you know ,COMMA you have to train with people who are inherently better than you .PERIOD 
and i went out there and made it to the big east ,COMMA which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season .PERIOD 
and at about <NUM> meters of my <NUM> meters sprint ,COMMA in all my glory ,COMMA i came out of my leg .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA i almost came out of it ,COMMA in front of ,COMMA like ,COMMA <NUM> people .PERIOD 
and i ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA was just mortified -- because i was signed up for the <NUM> ,COMMA you know ,COMMA which went off in a half hour .PERIOD 
i went to my coach :COLON please ,COMMA don't make me do this .PERIOD 
i can't do this in front of all those people .PERIOD my legs will come off .PERIOD 
and if it came off at <NUM> there's no way i'm going <NUM> meters .PERIOD 
and he just sat there like this .PERIOD 
my pleas fell on deaf ears ,COMMA thank god .PERIOD 
because you know ,COMMA the man is from brooklyn ;SEMICOLON he's a big man .PERIOD he says ,COMMA aimee ,COMMA so what if your leg falls off ?QUESTIONMARK 
you pick it up ,COMMA you put the damn thing back on ,COMMA and finish the goddamn race !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and i did .PERIOD so ,COMMA he kept me in line .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA then aimee makes it to the <NUM> paralympics ,COMMA and she's all excited .PERIOD her family's coming down -- it's a big deal .PERIOD 
it's now two years that you've been running ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA a year .PERIOD 
a year .PERIOD and why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA atlanta .PERIOD 
the paralympics ,COMMA just for a little bit of clarification ,COMMA are the olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees ,COMMA persons with cerebral palsy ,COMMA and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the special olympics ,COMMA which deals with people with mental disabilities .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here we are ,COMMA a week after the olympics and down at atlanta ,COMMA and i'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago ,COMMA i got out on a gravel track and couldn't run <NUM> meters .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA here i am -- never lost .PERIOD 
i set new records at the us .PERIOD nationals -- the olympic trials -- that may ,COMMA and was sure that i was coming home with the gold .PERIOD 
i was also the only ,COMMA what they call bilateral bk -- below the knee .PERIOD 
i was the only woman who would be doing the long jump .PERIOD 
i had just done the long jump ,COMMA and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says ,COMMA how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA we're supposed to have a planar foot ,COMMA so we can't get off on the springboard .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i just did it .PERIOD no one told me that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's funny -- i'm three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so i'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA i made it for the long jump and the 100-meter .PERIOD 
and i'm sure of it ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was ,COMMA like ,COMMA this is my time for shine .PERIOD 
and we're at the trainee warm-up track ,COMMA which is a few blocks away from the olympic stadium .PERIOD 
these legs that i was on ,COMMA which i'll take out right now -- i was the first person in the world on these legs .PERIOD 
i was the guinea pig ,COMMA i'm telling you ,COMMA this was ,COMMA like -- talk about a tourist attraction .PERIOD 
and i'm always looking around ,COMMA like ,COMMA where is my competition ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's my first international meet .PERIOD 
i tried to get it out of anybody i could ,COMMA you know ,COMMA who am i running against here ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh ,COMMA aimee ,COMMA we'll have to get back to you on that one .PERIOD 
i wanted to find out times .PERIOD 
don't worry ,COMMA you're doing great .PERIOD 
this is <NUM> minutes before my race in the olympic stadium ,COMMA and they post the heat sheets .PERIOD and i go over and look .PERIOD 
and my fastest time ,COMMA which was the world record ,COMMA was <NUM> .PERIOD 
then i'm looking :COLON the next lane ,COMMA lane two ,COMMA is <NUM> .PERIOD 
lane three is <NUM> .PERIOD lane four is <NUM> .PERIOD i said ,COMMA what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they shove us all into the shuttle bus ,COMMA and all the women there are missing a hand .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm just ,COMMA like -- they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other' you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA i'd never lost anything ,COMMA like ,COMMA whether it would be the scholarship or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'd won five golds when i skied .PERIOD in everything ,COMMA i came in first .PERIOD 
and georgetown -- that was great .PERIOD 
i was losing ,COMMA but it was the best training because this was atlanta .PERIOD 
here we are ,COMMA like ,COMMA crème de la crème ,COMMA and there is no doubt about it ,COMMA that i'm going to lose big .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm just thinking ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA my whole family got in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i was the only female us .PERIOD sprinter .PERIOD 
and i remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd ,COMMA like ,COMMA the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see .PERIOD 
and i'm like ,COMMA i know !EXCLAMATIONMARK look !EXCLAMATIONMARK this isn't right .PERIOD 
and i'm thinking that's my last card to play here ;SEMICOLON if i'm not going to beat these girls ,COMMA i'm going to mess their heads a little ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA it was definitely the rocky iv sensation of me versus germany ,COMMA and everyone else -- estonia and poland -- was in this heat .PERIOD 
and the gun went off ,COMMA and all i remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed .PERIOD 
if i had won everything -- but it was like ,COMMA what was the point ?QUESTIONMARK 
all this training -- i had transformed my life .PERIOD 
i became a collegiate athlete ,COMMA you know .PERIOD i became an olympic athlete .PERIOD 
and it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA the fact that i set my sights ,COMMA just a year and three months before ,COMMA on becoming an olympic athlete and saying ,COMMA here's my life going in this direction -- and i want to take it here for a while ,COMMA and just seeing how far i could push it .PERIOD 
and the fact that i asked for help -- how many people jumped on board ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many people gave of their time and their expertise ,COMMA and their patience ,COMMA to deal with me ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that was this collective glory -- that there was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do :COLON sitting back and realizing the progression ,COMMA how far you've come at this day to this goal ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
it's important to focus on a goal ,COMMA i think ,COMMA but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person .PERIOD 
that's the achievement ,COMMA i think .PERIOD that's the real achievement .PERIOD 
why don't you show them your legs ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh ,COMMA sure .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA these are my pretty legs .PERIOD 
you've got to come up and see them .PERIOD 
there are hair follicles on them ,COMMA and i can paint my toenails .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA like ,COMMA i can wear heels .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want .PERIOD 
you got to pick your height ?QUESTIONMARK 
i got to pick my height ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD 
patrick ewing ,COMMA who played for georgetown in the '80s ,COMMA comes back every summer .PERIOD 
and i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries .PERIOD 
i'm like ,COMMA get it off !EXCLAMATIONMARK don't worry about it ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
you can be eight feet tall .PERIOD just take them off .PERIOD 
he didn't find it as humorous as i did ,COMMA anyway .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA these are my sprinting legs ,COMMA made of carbon graphite ,COMMA like i said ,COMMA and i've got to make sure i've got the right socket .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA i've got so many legs in here .PERIOD 
these are -- do you want to hold that actually ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's another leg i have for ,COMMA like ,COMMA tennis and softball .PERIOD 
and then this is the silicon sheath i roll over ,COMMA to keep it on .PERIOD which ,COMMA when i sweat ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm pistoning out of it .PERIOD 
are you a different height ?QUESTIONMARK 
in these ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know .PERIOD i don't think so .PERIOD 
i may be a little taller .PERIOD i actually can put both of them on .PERIOD 
she can't really stand on these legs .PERIOD she has to be moving ,COMMA so . .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i definitely have to be moving ,COMMA and balance is a little bit of an art in them .PERIOD 
but without having the silicon sock ,COMMA i'm just going to try slip in it .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i run on these ,COMMA and have shocked half the world on these .PERIOD 
these are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run .PERIOD 
if you ever watch a sprinter ,COMMA the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track .PERIOD 
so when i stand in these legs ,COMMA my hamstring and my glutes are contracted ,COMMA as they would be had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet .PERIOD 
it's a company in san diego called flex-foot .PERIOD 
and i was a guinea pig ,COMMA as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .PERIOD 
but actually these ,COMMA like i said ,COMMA are still the actual prototype .PERIOD 
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at ,COMMA they were everywhere .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's like a big -- it's come full circle .PERIOD 
moderator :COLON aimee and the designer of them will be at tedmed <NUM> ,COMMA and we'll talk about the design of them .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA we'll do that .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA there you go .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are the sprint legs ,COMMA and i can put my other .PERIOD 
can you tell about who designed your other legs ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes .PERIOD these i got in a place called bournemouth ,COMMA england ,COMMA about two hours south of london ,COMMA and i'm the only person in the united states with these ,COMMA which is a crime because they are so beautiful .PERIOD 
and i don't even mean ,COMMA like ,COMMA because of the toes and everything .PERIOD 
they're also silicon .PERIOD 
this is a really basic ,COMMA basic prosthetic limb under here .PERIOD 
it's like a barbie foot under this .PERIOD 
it is .PERIOD it's just stuck in this position ,COMMA so i have to wear a two-inch heel .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it .PERIOD 
i don't know how good you can see it ,COMMA but ,COMMA like ,COMMA it really is .PERIOD 
there're veins on the feet ,COMMA and then my heel is pink ,COMMA and my achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit .PERIOD 
and it's really an amazing store .PERIOD i got them a year and two weeks ago .PERIOD 
and this is just a silicon piece of skin .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA what happened was ,COMMA two years ago this man in belgium was saying ,COMMA god ,COMMA if i can go to madame tussauds' wax museum and see jerry hall replicated down to the color of her eyes ,COMMA looking so real as if she breathed ,COMMA why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg ,COMMA or an arm ,COMMA or a hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA they make ears for burn victims .PERIOD 
they do amazing stuff with silicon .PERIOD 
and she came into town and she rushed around and she said ,COMMA i have to buy some new shoes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we're an hour before the espys ,COMMA and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel .PERIOD 
and this poses a problem for me ,COMMA because it means i'm walking like that all night long .PERIOD 
for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD luckily ,COMMA the hotel was terrific .PERIOD 
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .PERIOD 
i said to the receptionist -- i mean ,COMMA i am just harried ,COMMA and sheryl's at my side -- i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA do you have anybody here who could help me ?QUESTIONMARK 
because i have this problem . .PERIOD you know ,COMMA at first they were just going to write me off ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you don't like your shoes ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD it's too late .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i've got these special feet that need a two-inch heel .PERIOD i have a three-inch heel .PERIOD 
i need a little bit off .PERIOD 
they didn't even want to go there .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA these legs are great .PERIOD 
i'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements .PERIOD 
i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers ,COMMA because i can't with these ones .PERIOD 
so .PERIOD moderator :COLON that's it .PERIOD 
that's aimee mullins .PERIOD 
the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional .PERIOD 
and i think some dispassionate ,COMMA quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .PERIOD 
i'd therefore like to propose that we employ ,COMMA we enlist ,COMMA the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses <NUM> billion dollars a year to copyright theft .PERIOD 
now rather than just argue about this number ,COMMA a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin ,COMMA and then to mars . .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD if we use pennies .PERIOD 
now this is obviously a powerful ,COMMA some might say dangerously powerful ,COMMA insight .PERIOD 
but it's also a morally important one .PERIOD 
because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about ,COMMA but this is actual economic losses .PERIOD 
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops ,COMMA as well as wheat ,COMMA tobacco ,COMMA rice ,COMMA sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum .PERIOD 
but identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math .PERIOD 
now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since napster first came on the scene .PERIOD 
so that's a chunk of what we're looking for .PERIOD 
but total movie revenues across theaters ,COMMA home video and pay-per-view are up .PERIOD 
and tv ,COMMA satellite and cable revenues are way up .PERIOD 
other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up .PERIOD 
so this small missing chunk here is puzzling .PERIOD 
since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms ,COMMA it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented ,COMMA but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the <NUM>'s .PERIOD 
<NUM> billion dollars of it a year ,COMMA which is enough ,COMMA at <NUM> seconds a ringtone ,COMMA that could stretch from here to neanderthal times .PERIOD 
it's true .PERIOD 
i have excel .PERIOD 
the movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over <NUM> jobs to content theft ,COMMA which is quite a lot when you consider that ,COMMA back in '<NUM> ,COMMA the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing <NUM> people .PERIOD 
other data has the music industry at about <NUM> people .PERIOD 
and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft ,COMMA have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .PERIOD 
and this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day .PERIOD 
and some people think that string theory is tough .PERIOD 
now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit .PERIOD 
it's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .PERIOD 
hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law .PERIOD 
some people think this number's a little bit large ,COMMA but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year .PERIOD 
now when this law first passed ,COMMA the world's hottest mp3 player could hold just <NUM> songs .PERIOD 
and it was a big christmas hit .PERIOD 
because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .PERIOD 
these days an ipod classic can hold <NUM> songs ,COMMA which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media .PERIOD 
or about <NUM> jobs .PERIOD 
now you might find copyright math strange ,COMMA but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts .PERIOD 
so that's it for now .PERIOD 
i hope you'll join me next time when i will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he american economy .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
we've got a real problem with math education right now .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA no one's very happy .PERIOD 
those learning it think it's disconnected ,COMMA uninteresting and hard .PERIOD 
those trying to employ them think they don't know enough .PERIOD 
governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies ,COMMA but don't know how to fix it .PERIOD 
and teachers are also frustrated .PERIOD 
yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history .PERIOD 
so at one end we've got falling interest in education in math ,COMMA and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world ,COMMA a more quantitative world than we ever have had .PERIOD 
so what's the problem ,COMMA why has this chasm opened up ,COMMA and what can we do to fix it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well actually ,COMMA i think the answer is staring us right in the face :COLON use computers .PERIOD 
i believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work .PERIOD 
so to explain that ,COMMA let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians .PERIOD 
it's done by geologists ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA biologists ,COMMA all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation .PERIOD 
it's actually very popular .PERIOD 
but in education it looks very different -- dumbed-down problems ,COMMA lots of calculating ,COMMA mostly by hand .PERIOD 
lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world ,COMMA except if you're learning it .PERIOD 
and another thing about math :COLON math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn't -- like am i drunk ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world .PERIOD 
you wouldn't have expected that a few years back .PERIOD 
so let's zoom out a bit and ask ,COMMA why are we teaching people math ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's the point of teaching people math ?QUESTIONMARK 
and in particular ,COMMA why are we teaching them math in general ?QUESTIONMARK 
why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think there are about three reasons :COLON technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies ,COMMA what i call everyday living -- to function in the world today ,COMMA you've got to be pretty quantitative ,COMMA much more so than a few years ago :COLON figure out your mortgages ,COMMA being skeptical of government statistics ,COMMA those kinds of things -- and thirdly ,COMMA what i would call something like logical mind training ,COMMA logical thinking .PERIOD 
over the years we've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically .PERIOD it's part of human society .PERIOD 
it's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .PERIOD 
so let's ask another question .PERIOD 
what is math ?QUESTIONMARK 
what do we mean when we say we're doing math ,COMMA or educating people to do math ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think it's about four steps ,COMMA roughly speaking ,COMMA starting with posing the right question .PERIOD 
what is it that we want to ask ?QUESTIONMARK what is it we're trying to find out here ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world ,COMMA beyond virtually any other part of doing math .PERIOD 
people ask the wrong question ,COMMA and surprisingly enough ,COMMA they get the wrong answer ,COMMA for that reason ,COMMA if not for others .PERIOD 
so the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem .PERIOD 
that's stage two .PERIOD 
once you've done that ,COMMA then there's the computation step .PERIOD 
turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA math is very powerful at doing that .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA turn it back to the real world .PERIOD 
did it answer the question ?QUESTIONMARK 
and also verify it -- crucial step .PERIOD 
now here's the crazy thing right now .PERIOD 
in math education ,COMMA we're spending about perhaps <NUM> percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA that's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one ,COMMA two and four -- conceptualizing problems ,COMMA applying them ,COMMA getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA crucial point here :COLON math is not equal to calculating .PERIOD 
math is a much broader subject than calculating .PERIOD 
now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years .PERIOD 
there was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand .PERIOD 
but in the last few decades that has totally changed .PERIOD 
we've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers .PERIOD 
calculating was typically the limiting step ,COMMA and now often it isn't .PERIOD 
but that math liberation didn't get into education yet .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA i think of calculating ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA as the machinery of math .PERIOD 
it's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can ,COMMA like to get a machine to do .PERIOD 
it's a means to an end ,COMMA not an end in itself ,COMMA and automation allows us to have that machinery .PERIOD 
i estimated that ,COMMA just today ,COMMA across the world ,COMMA we spent about <NUM> average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand .PERIOD 
so we better be damn sure -- and by the way ,COMMA they didn't even have fun doing it ,COMMA most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we're doing that and it has a real purpose .PERIOD 
i think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that .PERIOD 
and i think there are some cases .PERIOD 
for example :COLON mental arithmetic .PERIOD 
i still do a lot of that ,COMMA mainly for estimating .PERIOD 
people say ,COMMA is such and such true ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's still quicker to do that and more practical .PERIOD 
so i think practicality is one case where it's worth teaching people by hand .PERIOD 
and then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating ,COMMA but i think they're relatively small in number .PERIOD 
one thing i often ask about is ancient greek and how this relates .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA the thing we're doing right now is we're forcing people to learn mathematics .PERIOD 
it's a major subject .PERIOD 
i'm not for one minute suggesting that ,COMMA if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre -- they should do that .PERIOD 
that's absolutely the right thing ,COMMA for people to follow their self-interest .PERIOD 
i was somewhat interested in ancient greek ,COMMA but i don't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient greek .PERIOD 
i don't think it's warranted .PERIOD 
so i have this distinction between what we're making people do and the subject that's sort of mainstream and the subject that ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that .PERIOD 
so what are the issues people bring up with this ?QUESTIONMARK 
you shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject .PERIOD 
so my usual question is ,COMMA what do you mean by basics ?QUESTIONMARK 
basics of what ?QUESTIONMARK 
are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it ,COMMA or design it for that matter ?QUESTIONMARK 
are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think so .PERIOD 
i think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation .PERIOD 
a hundred years ago ,COMMA it's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .PERIOD 
but automation in cars allowed that to separate ,COMMA so driving is now a quite separate subject ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .PERIOD 
so automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving ,COMMA and i believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that .PERIOD 
it can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that .PERIOD 
so there's another thing that comes up with basics .PERIOD 
people confuse ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching .PERIOD 
so just because paper was invented before computers ,COMMA it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .PERIOD 
my daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .PERIOD 
she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops .PERIOD 
so i asked her one day ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when i was your age ,COMMA i didn't make these .PERIOD 
why do you think that was ?QUESTIONMARK 
and after a second or two ,COMMA carefully reflecting ,COMMA she said ,COMMA no paper ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you were born after computers and paper ,COMMA it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in ,COMMA you just want to have the best tool .PERIOD 
so another one that comes up is computers dumb math down .PERIOD 
this one kind of annoys me ,COMMA i must say .PERIOD 
do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they don't really understand ,COMMA for reasons they don't get ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think so .PERIOD 
and what's worse ,COMMA what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore .PERIOD 
when they're out of education ,COMMA they do it on a computer .PERIOD 
just to be clear ,COMMA i think computers can really help with this problem ,COMMA actually make it more conceptual .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA like any great tool ,COMMA they can be used completely mindlessly ,COMMA like turning everything into a multimedia show ,COMMA like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand ,COMMA where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand .PERIOD 
this is just nuts .PERIOD 
all backwards .PERIOD 
let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA normally in school ,COMMA you do things like solve quadratic equations .PERIOD 
but you see ,COMMA when you're using a computer ,COMMA you can just substitute .PERIOD 
you can make it a quartic equation .PERIOD make it kind of harder ,COMMA calculating-wise .PERIOD 
and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this .PERIOD 
they've got hair all over them .PERIOD 
they're not just simple ,COMMA dumbed-down things that we see in school math .PERIOD 
and think of the outside world .PERIOD 
do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think so -- quite the opposite .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding .PERIOD 
i think there is one thing that i think very valid here ,COMMA which is that i think understanding procedures and processes is important .PERIOD 
but there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .PERIOD 
it's called programming .PERIOD 
programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days ,COMMA and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand .PERIOD 
if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it .PERIOD 
so to be clear ,COMMA what i really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual ,COMMA simultaneously .PERIOD 
i can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible .PERIOD 
it's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual .PERIOD 
but i think we can do both at the same time here .PERIOD 
and we open up so many more possibilities .PERIOD 
you can do so many more problems .PERIOD 
what i really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before .PERIOD 
and experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math ,COMMA interact with it ,COMMA feel it .PERIOD 
we want people who can feel the math instinctively .PERIOD 
that's what computers allow us to do .PERIOD 
another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum .PERIOD 
traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate ,COMMA but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts ,COMMA however hard the calculating .PERIOD 
so calculus has traditionally been taught very late .PERIOD 
why is this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA it's damn hard doing the calculations ,COMMA that's the problem .PERIOD 
but actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group .PERIOD 
and very ,COMMA very simple .PERIOD 
we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA it turns into a circle .PERIOD 
and by the way ,COMMA she was also very insistent on being able to change the color ,COMMA an important feature for this demonstration .PERIOD 
very simple example .PERIOD 
that's a view of the world that we don't usually give people for many ,COMMA many years after this .PERIOD 
so one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams .PERIOD 
in the end ,COMMA if we test everyone by hand in exams ,COMMA it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters .PERIOD 
and one of the reasons it's so important -- so it's very important to get computers in exams .PERIOD 
and then we can ask questions ,COMMA real questions ,COMMA questions like ,COMMA what's the best life insurance policy to get ?QUESTIONMARK -- real questions that people have in their everyday lives .PERIOD 
and you see ,COMMA this isn't some dumbed-down model here .PERIOD 
this is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens .PERIOD 
how many years of protection do i need ?QUESTIONMARK 
what does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams ,COMMA but i think it's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people's real understanding .PERIOD 
so i believe [there is] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math .PERIOD 
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward ,COMMA and also our societies ,COMMA based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .PERIOD 
this isn't some optional extra .PERIOD 
and the country that does this first will ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even ,COMMA an improved economy ,COMMA an improved outlook .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i even talk about us moving from what we often call now the knowledge economy to what we might call a computational knowledge economy ,COMMA where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is .PERIOD 
we can engage so many more students with this ,COMMA and they can have a better time doing it .PERIOD 
and let's understand :COLON this is not an incremental sort of change .PERIOD 
we're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real-world math .PERIOD 
and you know if you walk across a chasm ,COMMA you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all -- bigger disaster .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA what i'm suggesting is that we should leap off ,COMMA we should increase our velocity so it's high ,COMMA and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course ,COMMA having calculated our differential equation very carefully .PERIOD 
so i want to see a completely renewed ,COMMA changed math curriculum built from the ground up ,COMMA based on computers being there ,COMMA computers that are now ubiquitous almost .PERIOD 
calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years .PERIOD 
now i'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math ,COMMA but what i am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future .PERIOD 
let's go for it ,COMMA and while we're about it ,COMMA let's have a bit of fun ,COMMA for us ,COMMA for the students and for ted here .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
we're <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years after the advent of the macintosh ,COMMA which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .PERIOD 
it fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation ,COMMA thought about computers ,COMMA how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them .PERIOD 
it was such a radical change ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that the early macintosh development team in '<NUM> ,COMMA '<NUM> ,COMMA '<NUM> had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is an interesting little message ,COMMA and it's a lesson that has since ,COMMA i think ,COMMA been forgotten or lost or something ,COMMA and that is ,COMMA namely ,COMMA that the os is the interface .PERIOD 
the interface is the os .PERIOD 
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .PERIOD 
it wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines .PERIOD 
there were no graphics routines .PERIOD there were no mouse drivers .PERIOD 
so it was a necessity .PERIOD 
but in the quarter-century since then ,COMMA we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk .PERIOD 
so memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between <NUM> and a million .PERIOD 
same thing for processor speeds .PERIOD 
networks ,COMMA we didn't have networks at all at the time of the macintosh's introduction ,COMMA and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA graphics :COLON today <NUM> dollars and <NUM> cents at best buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from sgi only a decade ago .PERIOD 
so we've got that incredible ramp-up .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA on the side ,COMMA we've got the web and ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA the cloud ,COMMA which is fantastic ,COMMA but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction .PERIOD 
so we've forgotten to invent new interfaces .PERIOD 
certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard ,COMMA and people are starting to wake up about that .PERIOD 
so what happens next ?QUESTIONMARK where do we go from there ?QUESTIONMARK 
the problem ,COMMA as we see it ,COMMA has to do with a single ,COMMA simple word :COLON space ,COMMA or a single ,COMMA simple phrase :COLON real world geometry .PERIOD 
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in ,COMMA that we teach them in ,COMMA are hideously insensate when it comes to space .PERIOD 
they don't understand real world space .PERIOD 
it's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well .PERIOD 
they also don't understand time ,COMMA but that's a matter for a separate talk .PERIOD 
so what happens if you start to explain space to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
one thing you might get is something like the luminous room .PERIOD 
the luminous room is a system in which it's considered that input and output spaces are co-located .PERIOD 
that's a strangely simple ,COMMA and yet unexplored idea ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you use a mouse ,COMMA your hand is down here on the mouse pad .PERIOD 
it's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about :COLON the pixels are up on the display .PERIOD 
so here was a room in which all the walls ,COMMA floors ,COMMA ceilings ,COMMA pets ,COMMA potted plants ,COMMA whatever was in there ,COMMA were capable ,COMMA not only of display but of sensing as well .PERIOD 
and that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this .PERIOD 
that's a digital storage in a physical container .PERIOD 
has to come back out ,COMMA whatever you put in .PERIOD 
this little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well .PERIOD 
if you presented it with a chess board ,COMMA it tried to figure out what you might mean by that .PERIOD 
and if there was nothing for them to do ,COMMA the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away .PERIOD 
the academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous ,COMMA so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser .PERIOD 
the beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects ,COMMA and the system projects down the laser beam path .PERIOD 
so you've got an interface that has no interface .PERIOD 
you operate the world as you operate the real world ,COMMA which is to say ,COMMA with your hands .PERIOD 
similarly ,COMMA a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left -- not that remarkable in a sense ;SEMICOLON we didn't invent the mathematics .PERIOD 
but if you displayed that on a crt or flat panel display ,COMMA it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object ,COMMA a real world object in that .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA the real world merges with the simulation .PERIOD 
and we make the machine meet them half way .PERIOD 
and if you introduce tools like this inverse clock ,COMMA then you can control the sun's position in the sky .PERIOD 
that's <NUM> am .PERIOD shadows .PERIOD 
they get a little shorter at <NUM> am .PERIOD 
there you are ,COMMA swinging the sun around .PERIOD 
short shadows at noon and so forth .PERIOD 
and we built up a series of tools like this .PERIOD 
a material wand makes the building into a sort of frank gehry thing that reflects light in all directions .PERIOD 
are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ?QUESTIONMARK 
a zoning tool connects distant structures ,COMMA a building and a roadway .PERIOD 
are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ?QUESTIONMARK and so forth .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated ,COMMA that's great ;SEMICOLON they should seem familiar .PERIOD 
this stuff was undertaken at mit and the media lab under the incredible direction of professor hiroshi ishii ,COMMA director of the tangible media group .PERIOD 
but it was that work that was seen by alex mcdowell ,COMMA one of the world's legendary production designers .PERIOD 
but alex was preparing a little ,COMMA sort of obscure ,COMMA indie ,COMMA arthouse film called minority report for steven spielberg ,COMMA and invited us to come out from mit and design the interfaces that would appear in that film .PERIOD 
so this led full circle ,COMMA in a strange way ,COMMA to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface :COLON the spatial operating environment ,COMMA we call it .PERIOD 
so here we have a bunch of stuff ,COMMA some images .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA using a hand ,COMMA we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom ,COMMA six degrees of navigational control .PERIOD 
and it's fun to fly through mr .PERIOD beckett's eye .PERIOD 
and you can come back out through the scary orangutan .PERIOD 
and that's all well and good .PERIOD 
let's do something a little more difficult .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA we have a whole bunch of disparate images .PERIOD 
we can fly around them .PERIOD 
so navigation is a fundamental issue .PERIOD 
you have to be able to navigate in 3d .PERIOD 
much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial .PERIOD 
and the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it .PERIOD 
now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways .PERIOD 
so we can throw it out like that .PERIOD let's reset it .PERIOD 
we can organize it this way .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it's not just about navigation ,COMMA but about manipulation as well .PERIOD 
so if we don't like stuff ,COMMA or we're intensely curious about ernst haeckel's scientific falsifications ,COMMA we can pull them out like that .PERIOD 
and then if it's time for analysis ,COMMA we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution .PERIOD 
let's just come down a bit and fly around .PERIOD 
so that's a different way to look at stuff .PERIOD 
if you're of a more analytical nature then you might want ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to look at this as a color histogram .PERIOD 
so now we've got the stuff color-sorted ,COMMA angle maps onto color .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA if we want to select stuff ,COMMA 3d ,COMMA space ,COMMA the idea that we're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in ,COMMA not in 2d ,COMMA not in fake 2d ,COMMA but in actual 3d .PERIOD 
here are some selection planes .PERIOD 
and we'll perform this boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA from there to the world of real work .PERIOD 
here's a logistics system ,COMMA a small piece of one that we're currently building .PERIOD 
there're a lot of elements .PERIOD 
and one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information .PERIOD 
so here's a familiar place .PERIOD 
and we'll bring this back here for a second .PERIOD 
maybe select a little bit of that .PERIOD 
and bring out this graph .PERIOD 
and we should ,COMMA now ,COMMA be able to fly in here and have a closer look .PERIOD 
one thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers .PERIOD 
that's the old way ,COMMA that's the old mantra :COLON one machine ,COMMA one human ,COMMA one mouse ,COMMA one screen .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that doesn't really cut it anymore .PERIOD 
in the real world ,COMMA we have people who collaborate ;SEMICOLON we have people who have to work together ,COMMA and we have many different displays .PERIOD 
and we might want to look at these various images .PERIOD 
we might want to ask for some help .PERIOD 
the author of this new pointing device is sitting over there ,COMMA so i can pull this from there to there .PERIOD 
these are unrelated machines ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the computation is space soluble and network soluble .PERIOD 
so i'm going to leave that over there because i have a question for paul .PERIOD 
paul is the designer of this wand ,COMMA and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on .PERIOD 
so let me get some of these out of the way .PERIOD 
let's pull this apart :COLON i'll go ahead and explode it .PERIOD 
kevin ,COMMA can you help ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me see if i can help us find the circuit board .PERIOD 
mind you ,COMMA it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise ,COMMA but we do it in the lab all the time .PERIOD 
all right .PERIOD 
so collaborative work ,COMMA whether it's immediately co-located or distant and distinct ,COMMA is always important .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery .PERIOD 
we at oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form .PERIOD 
so we have a large number of movies stuck inside here .PERIOD 
and let's just pick out a few elements .PERIOD 
we can zip through them as a possibility .PERIOD 
we can grab elements off the front ,COMMA where upon they reanimate ,COMMA come to life ,COMMA and drag them down onto the table here .PERIOD 
we may need more than one .PERIOD 
and we probably need ,COMMA well ,COMMA we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA let's take that one .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA cowboys and french farce people don't go well together ,COMMA and the system knows that .PERIOD 
and he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs <NUM> [dollars] ,COMMA or whether you have to spring <NUM> million bucks to buy the stolen vermeer ;SEMICOLON he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence .PERIOD 
and i think that it's time that we asked for the same from technology .PERIOD 
technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity ,COMMA and we need to demand that ,COMMA in fact .PERIOD 
for some of this kind of technology ,COMMA ground center is a combination of design ,COMMA which is crucially important .PERIOD 
we can't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as well ,COMMA as of efficacy ,COMMA agency .PERIOD 
we're ,COMMA as human beings ,COMMA the creatures that create ,COMMA and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image .PERIOD 
so i will leave you with that .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON so to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from bill gates -- when ?QUESTIONMARK 
when real ?QUESTIONMARK when for us ,COMMA not just in a lab and on a stage ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA it has to be for every human being .PERIOD 
we won't have succeeded unless we take that next big step .PERIOD 
i mean it's been <NUM> years .PERIOD 
can there really be only one interface ?QUESTIONMARK there can't .PERIOD 
but does that mean that ,COMMA at your desk or in your home ,COMMA you need projectors ,COMMA cameras ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA how can it work ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display .PERIOD 
it'll be built into architecture .PERIOD 
the gloves go away in a matter of months or years .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in your mind ,COMMA five years time ,COMMA someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think in five years time when you buy a computer ,COMMA you'll get this .PERIOD 
well that's cool .PERIOD 
the world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used .PERIOD 
what do you think ,COMMA what in your mind is the first killer app for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's a good question ,COMMA and we ask ourselves that every day .PERIOD 
at the moment ,COMMA our early-adopter customers -- and these systems are deployed out in the real world -- do all the big data intensive ,COMMA data heavy problems with it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA whether it's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction ,COMMA financial services ,COMMA pharmaceuticals ,COMMA bioinformatics ,COMMA those are the topics right now ,COMMA but that's not a killer app .PERIOD 
and i understand what you're asking .PERIOD 
c'mon ,COMMA c'mon .PERIOD martial arts ,COMMA games .PERIOD c'mon .PERIOD 
john ,COMMA thank you for making science-fiction real .PERIOD 
it's been a great pleasure .PERIOD 
thank you to you all .PERIOD 
i thought i'd tell you a little about what i like to write .PERIOD 
and i like to immerse myself in my topics .PERIOD 
and i see my life as a series of experiments .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i work for esquire magazine ,COMMA and a couple of years ago ,COMMA i wrote an article called my outsourced life ,COMMA where i hired a team of people in bangalore ,COMMA india ,COMMA to live my life for me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they answered my emails .PERIOD 
they answered my phone .PERIOD 
they argued with my wife for me ,COMMA and they read my son bedtime stories .PERIOD 
it was the best month of my life ,COMMA because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies .PERIOD 
more recently ,COMMA i wrote an article for esquire called -- about radical honesty .PERIOD 
and this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in virginia ,COMMA who says that you should never ,COMMA ever lie ,COMMA except maybe during poker and golf ,COMMA his only exceptions .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA more than that ,COMMA whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i decided i would try this for a month .PERIOD 
this was the worst month of my life .PERIOD 
i do not recommend this at all .PERIOD 
to give you a sense of the experience ,COMMA the article was called ,COMMA i think you're fat .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that was hard .PERIOD 
my most recent book -- my previous book was called the know-it-all ,COMMA and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world ,COMMA or more precisely from aak ,COMMA which is a type of east asian music ,COMMA all the way to zwyiec ,COMMA which is -- well ,COMMA i don't want to ruin the ending .PERIOD 
it's a very exciting twist ending ,COMMA like an o .PERIOD henry novel ,COMMA so i won't ruin it .PERIOD 
but i love that one ,COMMA because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb .PERIOD 
although ,COMMA listening to kevin kelly ,COMMA you don't have to remember anything .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i wasted some time there .PERIOD 
i love those experiments ,COMMA but i think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that i've done is my most recent experiment ,COMMA where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible ,COMMA the year of living biblically .PERIOD 
and i undertook this for two reasons .PERIOD 
the first was that i grew up with no religion at all .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA not very .PERIOD 
but i've become increasingly interested in religion .PERIOD 
i do think it's the defining issue of our time ,COMMA or one of the main ones .PERIOD 
and i have a son .PERIOD i want to know what to teach him .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i decided to dive in head first ,COMMA and try to live the bible .PERIOD 
the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism ,COMMA religious fundamentalism ,COMMA and people who say they take the bible literally ,COMMA which is ,COMMA according to some polls ,COMMA as high as <NUM> or <NUM> percent of america .PERIOD 
so i decided ,COMMA what if you really did take the bible literally ?QUESTIONMARK 
i decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the bible literally ,COMMA without picking and choosing .PERIOD 
i had jewish bibles .PERIOD 
a friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible ,COMMA where the twenty-third psalm is rendered as ,COMMA the lord is all that ,COMMA as opposed to what i knew it as ,COMMA the lord is my shepherd .PERIOD 
then i went down and i read several versions ,COMMA and i wrote down every single law that i could find .PERIOD 
and this was a very long list -- over <NUM> rules .PERIOD 
and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of -- the ten commandments ,COMMA love your neighbor ,COMMA be fruitful and multiply .PERIOD 
so i wanted to follow those .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA i take my projects very seriously ,COMMA because i had twins during my year ,COMMA so i definitely take my projects seriously .PERIOD 
but i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible .PERIOD 
there is the law in leviticus ,COMMA you cannot shave the corners of your beard .PERIOD 
i didn't know where my corners were ,COMMA so i decided to let the whole thing grow ,COMMA and this is what i looked like by the end .PERIOD 
as you can imagine ,COMMA i spent a lot of time at airport security .PERIOD 
my wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA certainly the challenge was there .PERIOD 
the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers ,COMMA so i thought ,COMMA sounds strange ,COMMA but i'll try it .PERIOD 
you only know if you try it .PERIOD 
i got rid of all my poly-cotton t-shirts .PERIOD 
the bible says that if two men are in a fight ,COMMA and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man ,COMMA then her hand shall be cut off .PERIOD 
that one i followed by default ,COMMA by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby ,COMMA looking like she had a strong grip .PERIOD 
so -- oh ,COMMA there's another shot of my beard .PERIOD 
i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing ,COMMA and incredibly challenging .PERIOD 
the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i could spend a year not killing ,COMMA but spending a year not gossiping ,COMMA not coveting ,COMMA not lying -- you know ,COMMA i live in new york ,COMMA and i work as a journalist ,COMMA so this was <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent of my day i had to do it .PERIOD 
but it was really interesting ,COMMA because i was able to make some progress ,COMMA because i couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts .PERIOD 
this was one of the huge lessons of the year ,COMMA is that i almost pretended to be a better person ,COMMA and i became a little bit of a better person .PERIOD 
so i had always thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you change your mind ,COMMA and you change your behavior ,COMMA but it's often the other way around .PERIOD 
you change your behavior ,COMMA and you change your mind .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you want to become more compassionate ,COMMA you visit sick people in the hospital ,COMMA and you will become more compassionate .PERIOD 
you donate money to a cause ,COMMA and you become emotionally involved in that cause .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it really was cognitive psychology -- you know ,COMMA cognitive dissonance -- that i was experiencing .PERIOD 
the bible actually talks about cognitive psychology ,COMMA very primitive cognitive psychology .PERIOD 
in the proverbs ,COMMA it says that if you smile ,COMMA you will become happier ,COMMA which ,COMMA as we know ,COMMA is actually true .PERIOD 
the second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century america .PERIOD 
and perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i was able to stone one adulterer .PERIOD 
it happened -- i was in the park ,COMMA and i was dressed in my biblical clothing ,COMMA so sandals and sort of a white robe ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because again ,COMMA the outer affects the inner .PERIOD 
and this man came up to me and he said ,COMMA why are you dressed like that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that would be great !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and i actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks ,COMMA hoping for just this interaction -- and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand .PERIOD 
he was actually an elderly man ,COMMA mid-70s ,COMMA just so you know .PERIOD 
but he's still an adulterer ,COMMA and still quite angry .PERIOD 
he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face ,COMMA and i felt that i could -- eye for an eye -- i could retaliate ,COMMA and throw one back at him .PERIOD 
so that was my experience stoning ,COMMA and it did allow me to talk about ,COMMA in a more serious way ,COMMA these big issues .PERIOD 
how can the bible be so barbaric in some places ,COMMA and yet so incredibly wise in others ?QUESTIONMARK 
how should we view the bible ?QUESTIONMARK 
should we view it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as original intent ,COMMA like a sort of a scalia version of the bible ?QUESTIONMARK 
how was the bible written ?QUESTIONMARK 
and actually ,COMMA since this is a tech crowd ,COMMA i talk in the book about how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia ,COMMA because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years .PERIOD 
and it's sort of evolved .PERIOD 
it's not a book that was written and came down from on high .PERIOD 
so i thought i would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways ,COMMA the bigger lessons that i learned from my year .PERIOD 
the first is ,COMMA thou shalt not take the bible literally .PERIOD 
this became very ,COMMA very clear ,COMMA early on .PERIOD 
because if you do ,COMMA then you end up acting like a crazy person ,COMMA and stoning adulterers ,COMMA or -- here's another example .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that's another .PERIOD i did spend some time shepherding .PERIOD 
it's a very relaxing vocation .PERIOD i recommend it .PERIOD 
but this one is -- the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month ,COMMA and more than that ,COMMA you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .PERIOD 
and my wife thought this was very offensive ,COMMA so she sat in every seat in our apartment ,COMMA and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i met with creationists .PERIOD 
i went to the creationists' museum .PERIOD 
and these are the ultimate literalists .PERIOD 
and it was fascinating ,COMMA because they were not stupid people at all .PERIOD 
i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .PERIOD 
it's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the bible that they distort all the data to fit their model .PERIOD 
and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .PERIOD 
and i will say ,COMMA though ,COMMA the museum is gorgeous .PERIOD 
if you're ever in kentucky ,COMMA there's ,COMMA you can see a movie of the flood ,COMMA and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA whatever you think of creationism -- and i think it's crazy -- they did a great job .PERIOD 
another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks .PERIOD 
and this one was a big lesson because i was praying ,COMMA giving these prayers of thanksgiving ,COMMA which was odd for an agnostic .PERIOD 
but i was saying thanks all the time ,COMMA every day ,COMMA and i started to change my perspective .PERIOD 
and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day ,COMMA that i didn't even notice ,COMMA that i took for granted ,COMMA as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is actually a key to happiness for me ,COMMA is to just remember when i came over here ,COMMA the car didn't flip over ,COMMA and i didn't trip coming up the stairs .PERIOD 
it's a remarkable thing .PERIOD 
third ,COMMA that thou shall have reverence .PERIOD 
this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic ,COMMA and by the end of the year ,COMMA i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic ,COMMA which i love .PERIOD 
and i'm trying to start it as a movement .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if anyone wants to join ,COMMA the basic idea is ,COMMA whether or not there is a god ,COMMA there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness ,COMMA and that our rituals can be sacred .PERIOD 
the sabbath can be sacred .PERIOD 
this was one of the great things about my year ,COMMA doing the sabbath ,COMMA because i am a workaholic ,COMMA so having this one day where you cannot work ,COMMA it really ,COMMA that changed my life .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this idea of sacredness ,COMMA whether or not there is a god .PERIOD 
thou shall not stereotype .PERIOD 
this one happened because i spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout america because i wanted it to be more than about my journey .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i spent time with evangelical christians ,COMMA and hasidic jews ,COMMA and the amish .PERIOD 
i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible-talk a jehovah's witness .PERIOD 
after three and a half hours ,COMMA he looked at his watch ,COMMA he's like ,COMMA i gotta go .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD bless you ,COMMA bless you .PERIOD 
but it was interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA evangelical christianity ,COMMA and i found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .PERIOD 
there's a group i met with called the red letter christians ,COMMA and they focus on the red words in the bible ,COMMA which are the ones that jesus spoke .PERIOD 
that's how they printed them in the old bibles .PERIOD 
and their argument is that jesus never talked about homosexuality .PERIOD 
they have a pamphlet that says ,COMMA here's what jesus said about homosexuality ,COMMA and you open it up ,COMMA and there's nothing in it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they say jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts ,COMMA helping poor people .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA thou shalt not disregard the irrational .PERIOD 
this one was very unexpected because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i grew up with the scientific worldview ,COMMA and i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces .PERIOD 
and the thing is ,COMMA if they're not harmful ,COMMA they're not to be completely dismissed .PERIOD 
because i learned that -- i was thinking ,COMMA i was doing all these rituals ,COMMA these biblical rituals ,COMMA separating my wool and linen ,COMMA and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly tell us to do this ?QUESTIONMARK why would god care ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA we don't know ,COMMA but it's just rituals that give us meaning .PERIOD 
and they would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA what about you ?QUESTIONMARK 
you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .PERIOD 
if a guy from mars came down and saw ,COMMA here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics ,COMMA would the martians say ,COMMA 'well ,COMMA that guy ,COMMA he makes sense ,COMMA but that guy's crazy' so no ,COMMA i think that rituals are ,COMMA by nature ,COMMA irrational .PERIOD 
so the key is to choose the right rituals ,COMMA the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed .PERIOD 
and finally i learned that thou shall pick and choose .PERIOD 
and this one i learned because i tried to follow everything in the bible .PERIOD 
and i failed miserably .PERIOD 
because you can't .PERIOD 
you have to pick and choose .PERIOD and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing .PERIOD 
but my argument is ,COMMA what's wrong with cafeterias ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've had some great meals at cafeterias .PERIOD 
i've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion ,COMMA about tolerance ,COMMA about loving your neighbor ,COMMA as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin ,COMMA or intolerance ,COMMA or violence ,COMMA which are very much in the bible as well .PERIOD 
so if we are to find any meaning in this book ,COMMA then we have to really engage it ,COMMA and wrestle with it .PERIOD 
and i thought i'd end with just a couple more .PERIOD 
there's me reading the bible .PERIOD 
that's how i hailed taxicabs .PERIOD 
seriously ,COMMA and it worked .PERIOD and yes ,COMMA that was actually a rented sheep ,COMMA so i had to return that in the morning ,COMMA but it served well for a day .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA thank you so much for letting me speak .PERIOD 
and there was a lawyer in nairobi ,COMMA ory okolloh -- who some of you may know from her tedtalk -- who began blogging about it on her site ,COMMA kenyan pundit .PERIOD 
and shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence ,COMMA the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout .PERIOD 
and so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was .PERIOD 
and okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on .PERIOD 
the comments began pouring in ,COMMA and okolloh would collate them .PERIOD she would post them .PERIOD 
i could do this all day every day and i can't keep up .PERIOD 
there is more information about what's going on in kenya right now than any one person can manage .PERIOD 
if only there was a way to automate this .PERIOD 
and two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said ,COMMA we could do that ,COMMA and in <NUM> hours ,COMMA they launched ushahidi .PERIOD 
ushahidi -- the name means witness or testimony in swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field ,COMMA whether it's from the web or ,COMMA critically ,COMMA via mobile phones and sms ,COMMA aggregating it and putting it on a map .PERIOD 
that's all it is ,COMMA but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is ,COMMA but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it ,COMMA and it maps it and it makes it public .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA that maneuver called crisis mapping ,COMMA was kicked off in kenya in january of <NUM> .PERIOD 
it's since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud .PERIOD 
it's been deployed in washington dc .PERIOD to track snow cleanup .PERIOD 
and it's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .PERIOD 
and when you look at the map now posted on the ushahidi front page ,COMMA you can see that the number of deployments in ushahidi has gone worldwide ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
this went from a single idea and a single implementation in east africa in the beginning of <NUM> to a global deployment in less than three years .PERIOD 
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .PERIOD 
what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity .PERIOD 
and the interesting moment now ,COMMA the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true .PERIOD 
that is the resource that i'm talking about .PERIOD 
i call it cognitive surplus .PERIOD 
cognitive surplus is made up of two things .PERIOD 
the first ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA is the world's free time and talents .PERIOD 
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA that free time existed in the 20th century ,COMMA but we didn't get ushahidi in the 20th century .PERIOD 
that's the second half of cognitive surplus .PERIOD 
the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume ,COMMA and we got ,COMMA as a result ,COMMA very good at consuming .PERIOD 
but now that we've been given media tools -- the internet ,COMMA mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume ,COMMA what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes because we liked to be .PERIOD 
we were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us .PERIOD 
we still like to consume ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
but it turns out we also like to create ,COMMA and we like to share .PERIOD 
and it's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts -- that are the new design resource .PERIOD 
and using cognitive surplus ,COMMA we're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific ,COMMA literary ,COMMA artistic ,COMMA political efforts .PERIOD 
designing .PERIOD 
we're also getting ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a lot of lolcats .PERIOD 
lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions .PERIOD 
and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now .PERIOD 
this is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that ,COMMA along with ushahidi .PERIOD 
now i want to stipulate ,COMMA as the lawyers say ,COMMA that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .PERIOD 
there are other candidates of course ,COMMA but lolcats will do as a general case .PERIOD 
but here's the thing :COLON the stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act .PERIOD 
someone who has done something like this ,COMMA however mediocre and throwaway ,COMMA has tried something ,COMMA has put something forward in public .PERIOD 
there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work ,COMMA and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows ,COMMA it's a spectrum you're constantly struggling to get on top of .PERIOD 
the gap is between doing anything and doing nothing .PERIOD 
and someone who makes a lolcat has already crossed over that gap .PERIOD 
now it's tempting to want to get the ushahidis without the lolcats ,COMMA right ,COMMA to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff .PERIOD 
but media abundance never works that way .PERIOD 
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .PERIOD 
and that source is design for generosity .PERIOD 
it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around ,COMMA social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us ,COMMA how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them ,COMMA or because we're being paid to do them .PERIOD 
this is a graph from a paper by uri gneezy and aldo rustichini ,COMMA who set out to test ,COMMA at the beginning of this decade ,COMMA what they called deterrence theory .PERIOD 
and deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior :COLON if you want somebody to do less of something ,COMMA add a punishment and they'll do less of it .PERIOD 
simple ,COMMA straightforward ,COMMA commonsensical -- also ,COMMA largely untested .PERIOD 
and so they went and studied <NUM> daycare centers in haifa ,COMMA israel .PERIOD 
they studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension ,COMMA which is pick-up time .PERIOD 
meanwhile ,COMMA the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work ,COMMA running late ,COMMA running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late .PERIOD 
so gneezy and rustichini said ,COMMA how many instances of late pick-ups are there at these <NUM> daycare centers ?QUESTIONMARK 
now they saw -- and this is what the graph is ,COMMA these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals -- that there were between six and <NUM> instances of late pick-ups on average in these <NUM> daycare centers .PERIOD 
so they divided the daycare centers into two groups .PERIOD 
the white group there is the control group ;SEMICOLON they change nothing .PERIOD 
but the group of daycare centers represented by the black line ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we are changing this bargain as of right now .PERIOD 
if you pick your kid up more than <NUM> minutes late ,COMMA we're going to add a <NUM> shekel fine to your bill .PERIOD 
boom .PERIOD no ifs ,COMMA ands or buts .PERIOD 
and the minute they did that ,COMMA the behavior in those daycare centers changed .PERIOD 
and you can see immediately what happened ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
the fine broke the culture of the daycare center .PERIOD 
by adding a fine ,COMMA what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of <NUM> shekels ,COMMA and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers .PERIOD 
and so the parents ,COMMA quite sensibly ,COMMA said ,COMMA <NUM> shekels to pick my kid up late ?QUESTIONMARK 
what could be bad ?QUESTIONMARK 
the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational ,COMMA self-maximizing actors ,COMMA and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints .PERIOD 
but that's not right .PERIOD 
and critically ,COMMA the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did .PERIOD 
so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD all done ;SEMICOLON fine .PERIOD 
and then a really interesting thing happens :COLON nothing changes .PERIOD 
the culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed .PERIOD 
not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible ,COMMA that incompatibility can persist over long periods .PERIOD 
so the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain ,COMMA when you're really designing for generosity .PERIOD 
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the range that matters .PERIOD 
both of these rely on cognitive surplus .PERIOD 
both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share .PERIOD 
here is the critical difference between these :COLON lolcats is communal value .PERIOD 
it's value created by the participants for each other .PERIOD 
communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared ,COMMA publicly available data ,COMMA whether it's photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever .PERIOD 
this is good .PERIOD i like lolcats as much as the next guy ,COMMA maybe a little more even ,COMMA but this is also a largely solved problem .PERIOD 
i have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying ,COMMA where ,COMMA oh where ,COMMA can i find a picture of a cute cat ?QUESTIONMARK 
ushahidi ,COMMA by contrast ,COMMA is civic value .PERIOD 
and that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation .PERIOD 
it really is going to be a side effect of what we ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA make of these kinds of efforts .PERIOD 
there are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs .PERIOD 
that will be true year-in and year-out .PERIOD 
the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow ,COMMA and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century .PERIOD 
what's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said ,COMMA the inventor and entrepreneur .PERIOD 
kamen said ,COMMA free cultures get what they celebrate .PERIOD 
we've got this trillion hours a year .PERIOD 
we can use it to crack each other up ,COMMA and we're going to do that .PERIOD 
that ,COMMA we get for free .PERIOD 
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .PERIOD 
and to the degree we're going to do that ,COMMA to the degree we're able to do that ,COMMA we'll be able to change society .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what i'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of india's -- maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera ,COMMA which is cricket .PERIOD 
it's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want :COLON it's got love ,COMMA joy ,COMMA happiness ,COMMA sadness ,COMMA tears ,COMMA laughter ,COMMA lots of deceit ,COMMA intrigue .PERIOD 
and like all good soaps ,COMMA it jumps <NUM> years when the audience interest changes .PERIOD 
and that's exactly what cricket has done .PERIOD 
it's jumped <NUM> years into 20-over game .PERIOD 
and that's what i'm going to talk about ,COMMA how a small change leads to a very big revolution .PERIOD 
but it wasn't always like that .PERIOD 
cricket wasn't always this speed-driven generations game .PERIOD 
there was a time when you played cricket ,COMMA you played timeless test matches ,COMMA when you played on till the game got over .PERIOD 
and there was this game in march <NUM> that started on the third of march and ended on the 14th of march .PERIOD 
and it only ended because the english cricketers had to go from durban to cape town ,COMMA which is a two-hour train journey ,COMMA to catch the ship that left on the 17th ,COMMA because the next ship wasn't around for a long time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the match was ended in between .PERIOD 
and one of the english batsmen said ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK 
another half an hour and we would have won .PERIOD 
another half an hour after <NUM> days .PERIOD 
but there is a reason why india fell in love with cricket :COLON because we had about the same pace of life .PERIOD 
the mahabharata was like that as well ,COMMA wasn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
you fought by day ,COMMA then it was sunset ,COMMA so everyone went back home .PERIOD 
the only difference between the mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket ,COMMA everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day .PERIOD 
princes patronize the game ,COMMA not because they love the game ,COMMA but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the british rulers .PERIOD 
but there is one other reason why india fell in love with cricket ,COMMA which was ,COMMA all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball ,COMMA and any number of people could play it anywhere .PERIOD 
you could play it on the banks of the ganges -- that's as clean as the ganges has been for a long time .PERIOD 
or you could play many games in one small patch of land ,COMMA even if you didn't know which game you were actually in .PERIOD 
but slowly the game moved on ,COMMA you know ,COMMA finally .PERIOD 
you don't always have five days .PERIOD so ,COMMA we moved on ,COMMA and we started playing 50-over cricket .PERIOD 
and then an enormous accident took place .PERIOD 
in indian sport we don't make things happen ,COMMA accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time ,COMMA sometimes .PERIOD 
and suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game ,COMMA and we played it virtually every day .PERIOD 
there was more 50-over cricket than anywhere .PERIOD 
but there was another big date .PERIOD 
<NUM> was when we won the world cup .PERIOD 
<NUM>'<NUM> ,COMMA we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at india ,COMMA rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country .PERIOD 
and there are only two vehicles in india -- one real ,COMMA one scripted .PERIOD 
the scripted one is what you see in the movies ,COMMA the real one was cricket .PERIOD 
and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ,COMMA ravi dhariwal from pepsi ,COMMA decided he's going to take it all over the world .PERIOD 
and pepsi was this big revolution ,COMMA because they started taking cricket all over .PERIOD 
and so cricket started becoming big ;SEMICOLON cricket started bringing riches in .PERIOD 
television started covering cricket .PERIOD for a long time television said ,COMMA we won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it .PERIOD 
then they said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA the next rights are sold for <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
the next rights are sold for <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's a bit of a curve ,COMMA that .PERIOD 
and then another big accident happened in our cricket .PERIOD 
england invented <NUM> overs cricket ,COMMA and said ,COMMA the world must play <NUM> overs cricket .PERIOD 
just as england invented cricket ,COMMA and made the rest of the world play it .PERIOD 
thank god for them .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA india had to go and play the t20 world cup ,COMMA you see .PERIOD 
india didn't want to play the t20 world cup .PERIOD 
but we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin .PERIOD 
and then something very dramatic happened .PERIOD 
we got to the final ,COMMA and then this moment ,COMMA that will remain enshrined forever ,COMMA for everybody ,COMMA take a look .PERIOD 
the pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder .PERIOD 
announcer :COLON and zishan takes it !EXCLAMATIONMARK india wins !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
what a match for a twenty20 final .PERIOD 
india ,COMMA the world champions .PERIOD 
india ,COMMA t20 champions .PERIOD 
harsha bhogle :COLON suddenly india discovered this power of 20-overs cricket .PERIOD 
the accident ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there ,COMMA was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast .PERIOD 
if he had bowled fast ,COMMA the ball would have gone where it was meant to go ,COMMA but it didn't go .PERIOD and we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game .PERIOD 
and what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that india could be the best in the world .PERIOD 
it was at a time when investment was coming in ,COMMA india was feeling a little more confident about itself .PERIOD 
and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do .PERIOD 
and thankfully for all of us ,COMMA the english are very good at inventing things ,COMMA and then the gracious people that they are ,COMMA they let the world become very good at it .PERIOD 
and so england invented t20 cricket ,COMMA and allowed india to hijack it .PERIOD 
it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine ,COMMA we just took it straight away ,COMMA as is .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA we launched our own t20 league .PERIOD 
six weeks ,COMMA city versus city .PERIOD 
it was a new thing for us .PERIOD we had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country ,COMMA representing itself on the field .PERIOD 
one was war ,COMMA the indian army ,COMMA which we don't like to happen very often .PERIOD 
the other was indian cricket .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA suddenly we had to support city leagues .PERIOD 
but the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the west .PERIOD 
america is a home of leagues .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA right ,COMMA we'll build some glitzy leagues here in india .PERIOD 
but was india ready for it ?QUESTIONMARK 
because cricket ,COMMA for a long time in india was always organized .PERIOD 
it was never promoted ,COMMA it was never sold -- it was organized .PERIOD 
and look what they did with our beautiful ,COMMA nice ,COMMA simple family game .PERIOD 
all of a sudden ,COMMA you had that happening .PERIOD 
an opening ceremony to match every other .PERIOD 
this was an india that was buying corvettes .PERIOD this was an india that was buying jaguar .PERIOD 
this was an india that was adding more mobile phones per month than new zealand's population twice over .PERIOD 
but it was also a slightly more orthodox india that was very happy to be modern ,COMMA but didn't want to say that to people .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived .PERIOD 
everyone secretly watched them ,COMMA but everyone claimed not to .PERIOD 
the new owners of indian cricket were not the old princes .PERIOD 
they were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it ;SEMICOLON these were people who ran serious companies .PERIOD 
and so they started promoting cricket big time ,COMMA started promoting clubs big time .PERIOD 
and they've started promoting them with huge money behind it .PERIOD 
i mean the ipl had <NUM> billion dollars before a ball was bowled ,COMMA <NUM> billion dollars for television revenue over <NUM> years ,COMMA and another <NUM> million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money .PERIOD and then they had to appeal to their cities ,COMMA but they had to do it like the west ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK because we are setting up leagues .PERIOD 
but what they were very good at doing was making it very localized .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA just to give you an example of how they did it -- not manchester united style promotion ,COMMA but very mumbai style promotion .PERIOD take a look .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA maybe they dance better than they play .PERIOD 
but that's all right .PERIOD what it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket .PERIOD 
all along ,COMMA if you wanted a young cricketer ,COMMA you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality ,COMMA your own city ,COMMA and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers .PERIOD 
this was the new india ,COMMA wasn't it ?QUESTIONMARK this was the new world ,COMMA where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .PERIOD 
and all of a sudden ,COMMA indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the mumbai indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago ,COMMA overnight .PERIOD and when he had to go back to represent the west indies ,COMMA they asked him ,COMMA when do you have to reach ?QUESTIONMARK 
he said ,COMMA i have to be there by a certain time ,COMMA so i have to leave today .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD it's not about when you have to leave ;SEMICOLON it's about when do you have to reach there ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so he said ,COMMA i've got to reach on date x .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA fine ,COMMA you play to date x ,COMMA minus one .PERIOD 
never would india have thought on this scale before .PERIOD 
never would india have said ,COMMA i want a player to play one game for me ,COMMA and i will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to kingston ,COMMA jamaica to play a game .PERIOD 
and i just thought to myself ,COMMA wow ,COMMA we've arrived somewhere in the world ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have arrived somewhere .PERIOD we are thinking big .PERIOD 
but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket ,COMMA which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment .PERIOD 
there is cricket and the movies .PERIOD 
and they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA people started going to the cricket to watch preity zinta .PERIOD 
and something very interesting happened .PERIOD 
we started getting song and dance in indian cricket .PERIOD 
and so it started resembling the indian movies more and more .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA if you were on preity zinta's team -- as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well ,COMMA you got a hug from preity zinta .PERIOD 
so that was the ultimate reason to do well .PERIOD take a look -- everyone's watching preity zinta .PERIOD 
and then of course there was shah rukh playing the kolkata crowd .PERIOD 
we'd all seen matches in kolkata ,COMMA but we'd never seen anything like this :COLON shah rukh ,COMMA with the bengali song ,COMMA getting the audiences all worked up for kolkata -- not for india ,COMMA but for kolkata .PERIOD 
but take a look at this .PERIOD 
an indian film star hugging a pakistani cricketer because they'd won in kolkata .PERIOD 
can you imagine ?QUESTIONMARK 
and do you know what the pakistani cricketer said ?QUESTIONMARK 
i wish i was playing for preity zinta's team .PERIOD 
but i thought i'd take this opportunity -- there's a few people from pakistan in here .PERIOD 
i'm so happy that you're here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can play cricket together ,COMMA we can be friends .PERIOD 
so thank you very much for coming ,COMMA all of you from pakistan .PERIOD 
there was criticism too because they said ,COMMA players are being bought and sold ?QUESTIONMARK 
are they grain ?QUESTIONMARK 
are they cattle ?QUESTIONMARK 
because we had this auction ,COMMA you see .PERIOD 
how do you fix a price for a player ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so the auction that followed literally had people saying ,COMMA bang !EXCLAMATIONMARK so many million dollars for so-and-so player .PERIOD 
there it is .PERIOD 
auctioneer :COLON going at <NUM> dollars .PERIOD chennai .PERIOD 
shane warne sold for <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
suddenly ,COMMA a game which earned its players <NUM> rupees a day -- so <NUM> rupees for a test match ,COMMA but if you finish in four days you only got <NUM> .PERIOD 
the best indian players who played every test match -- every one of the internationals ,COMMA the top of the line players -- standard contracts are <NUM> dollars in a whole year .PERIOD 
now they were getting <NUM> for six days' work .PERIOD 
then andrew flintoff came by from england ,COMMA he got one and a half million dollars ,COMMA and he went back and said ,COMMA for four weeks ,COMMA i'm earning more than frank lampard and steven gerrard ,COMMA and i'm earning more than the footballers ,COMMA wow .PERIOD 
and where was he earning it from ?QUESTIONMARK from a little club in india .PERIOD 
could you have imagined that day would come ?QUESTIONMARK 
one and a half million dollars for six weeks' work .PERIOD 
that's not bad ,COMMA is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA at <NUM> billion dollars before the first ball was bowled .PERIOD 
what india was doing ,COMMA though ,COMMA was benchmarking itself against the best in the world ,COMMA and it became a huge brand .PERIOD 
lalit modi was on the cover of business today .PERIOD 
ipl became the biggest brand in india and ,COMMA because our elections ,COMMA had to be moved to south africa ,COMMA and we had to start the tournament in three weeks .PERIOD 
move a whole tournament to south africa in three weeks .PERIOD 
but we did it .PERIOD you know why ?QUESTIONMARK 
because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event ,COMMA and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks .PERIOD 
our population ,COMMA which for a long time we thought was a problem ,COMMA suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching -- the huge consuming class -- everybody came to watch the cricket .PERIOD 
we'd also made cricket the only sport in india ,COMMA which is a pity ,COMMA but in india every other sport pushes cricket to become big ,COMMA which is a bit of a tragedy of our times .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this last minute before i go -- there's a couple of side effects of all this .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA india was this land of opportunity .PERIOD 
cricketers all over the world said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we love india .PERIOD we love to play in india .PERIOD 
and that felt good ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
we said ,COMMA the dollar's quite powerful actually .PERIOD 
can you imagine ,COMMA you've got the dollar on view and there's no delhi belly in there anymore .PERIOD 
there's no filth ,COMMA there's no beggars ,COMMA all the snake charmers have vanished ,COMMA everybody's gone .PERIOD this tells you how the capitalist world rules .PERIOD 
right so ,COMMA finally ,COMMA an english game that india usurped a little bit ,COMMA but t20 is going to be the next missionary in the world .PERIOD 
if you want to take the game around the world ,COMMA it's got to be the shortest form of the game .PERIOD 
you can't take a timeless test to china and sit through <NUM> days with no result in the end ,COMMA or you can't take it all over the world .PERIOD 
so that's what t20 is doing .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
it turns out that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the world was given this gift in <NUM> by a dutch polymath named daniel bernoulli .PERIOD 
and what i want to talk to you about today is what that gift is ,COMMA and i also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is bernoulli's gift .PERIOD this is a direct quote .PERIOD 
and if it looks like greek to you ,COMMA it's because ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's greek .PERIOD 
but the simple english translation -- much less precise ,COMMA but it captures the gist of what bernoulli had to say -- was this :COLON the expected value of any of our actions -- that is ,COMMA the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things :COLON the odds that this action will allow us to gain something ,COMMA and the value of that gain to us .PERIOD 
in a sense ,COMMA what bernoulli was saying is ,COMMA if we can estimate and multiply these two things ,COMMA we will always know precisely how we should behave .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this simple equation ,COMMA even for those of you who don't like equations ,COMMA is something that you're quite used to .PERIOD 
here's an example :COLON if i were to tell you ,COMMA let's play a little coin toss game ,COMMA and i'm going to flip a coin ,COMMA and if it comes up heads ,COMMA i'm going to pay you <NUM> dollars ,COMMA but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me ,COMMA most of you would say ,COMMA sure ,COMMA i'll take that bet .PERIOD because you know that the odds of you winning are one half ,COMMA the gain if you do is <NUM> dollars ,COMMA that multiplies to five ,COMMA and that's more than i'm charging you to play .PERIOD so ,COMMA the answer is ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA it's not very simple in everyday life .PERIOD 
people are horrible at estimating both of these things ,COMMA and that's what i want to talk to you about today .PERIOD 
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do ,COMMA and those are errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed ,COMMA and errors in estimating the value of their own success .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me talk about the first one first .PERIOD 
you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads .PERIOD 
but as it turns out ,COMMA this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life .PERIOD that's why americans spend more -- i should say ,COMMA lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined .PERIOD 
the reason is ,COMMA this isn't how people do odds .PERIOD 
the way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the question i'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in oxford .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA you all know that the answer is dogs .PERIOD 
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes .PERIOD 
it was very easy to remember seeing dogs ,COMMA not so easy to remember pigs .PERIOD and each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind ,COMMA then dogs on leashes are more probable .PERIOD 
that's not a bad rule of thumb ,COMMA except when it is .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for example ,COMMA here's a word puzzle .PERIOD 
are there more four-letter english words with r in the third place or r in the first place ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you check memory very briefly ,COMMA make a quick scan ,COMMA and it's awfully easy to say to yourself ,COMMA ring ,COMMA rang ,COMMA rung ,COMMA and very hard to say to yourself ,COMMA pare ,COMMA park :COLON they come more slowly .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place .PERIOD 
the reason words with r in the third place come slowly to your mind isn't because they're improbable ,COMMA unlikely or infrequent .PERIOD 
you kind of shout out the sound ,COMMA s -- and the word comes .PERIOD 
it's like the dictionary ;SEMICOLON it's hard to look things up by the third letter .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray .PERIOD it's not just puzzles ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA when americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per <NUM> million us .PERIOD citizens .PERIOD 
and these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado ,COMMA fireworks ,COMMA asthma ,COMMA drowning ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
compare these to the actual numbers .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you see a very interesting pattern here ,COMMA which is first of all ,COMMA two things are vastly over-estimated ,COMMA namely tornadoes and fireworks .PERIOD 
two things are vastly underestimated :COLON dying by drowning and dying by asthma .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
when was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was ,COMMA boy dies of asthma ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not interesting because it's so common .PERIOD 
it's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we've seen tornadoes devastating cities ,COMMA or some poor schmuck who's blown his hands off with a firework on the fourth of july .PERIOD 
drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage .PERIOD 
they don't come quickly to mind ,COMMA and as a result ,COMMA we vastly underestimate them .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA this is kind of like the sesame street game of which thing doesn't belong ?QUESTIONMARK and you're right to say it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong ,COMMA because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous .PERIOD 
the way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide .PERIOD 
the lottery is an excellent example ,COMMA of course -- an excellent test-case of people's ability to compute probabilities .PERIOD 
and economists -- forgive me ,COMMA for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists ,COMMA at least among themselves ,COMMA refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax ,COMMA because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything .PERIOD 
we see this on tv ;SEMICOLON we read about it in the paper .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner ,COMMA the <NUM> million losers in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say ,COMMA me ?QUESTIONMARK i lost .PERIOD me ?QUESTIONMARK i lost .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television -- no sleep ,COMMA no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss ,COMMA and then at the end there's <NUM> seconds of ,COMMA and i won ,COMMA the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA i can prove this to you :COLON here's a little lottery .PERIOD 
there's <NUM> tickets in this lottery .PERIOD 
nine of them have been sold to these individuals .PERIOD 
it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and ,COMMA if you win ,COMMA you get <NUM> bucks .PERIOD is this a good bet ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA bernoulli tells us it is .PERIOD 
the expected value of this lottery is two dollars ;SEMICOLON this is a lottery in which you should invest your money .PERIOD 
and most people say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA i'll play .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA a slightly different version of this lottery :COLON imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named leroy .PERIOD 
leroy has nine tickets ;SEMICOLON there's one left .PERIOD 
do you want it ?QUESTIONMARK most people won't play this lottery .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you can see the odds of winning haven't changed ,COMMA but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win .PERIOD 
it's easy to see leroy getting the check ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
the fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play ,COMMA even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA estimating odds ,COMMA as difficult as it may seem ,COMMA is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value :COLON trying to say what something is worth ,COMMA how much we'll enjoy it ,COMMA how much pleasure it will give us .PERIOD 
i want to talk now about errors in value .PERIOD 
how much is this big mac worth ?QUESTIONMARK is it worth <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
most of you have the intuition that it's not -- you wouldn't pay that for it .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA to decide whether a big mac is worth <NUM> dollars requires that you ask one ,COMMA and only one question ,COMMA which is :COLON what else can i do with <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to australia and realized that they're not going to serve you any food ,COMMA but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the mcdonald's bag ,COMMA and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat ,COMMA you think ,COMMA i can't do anything else with this <NUM> dollars for <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
i can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
suddenly ,COMMA <NUM> dollars for a big mac might be a good deal .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA if you're visiting an underdeveloped country ,COMMA and <NUM> dollars buys you a gourmet meal ,COMMA it's exorbitant for a big mac .PERIOD 
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no ,COMMA before i'd even told you anything about the context ?QUESTIONMARK 
because most of you compared the price of this big mac to the price you're used to paying .PERIOD rather than asking ,COMMA what else can i do with my money ,COMMA comparing this investment to other possible investments ,COMMA you compared to the past .PERIOD 
and this is a systematic error people make .PERIOD 
what you knew is ,COMMA you paid three dollars in the past ;SEMICOLON <NUM> is outrageous .PERIOD 
this is an error ,COMMA and i can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA this is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA one of the most delicious tricks in marketing ,COMMA is to say something used to be higher ,COMMA and suddenly it seems like a very good deal .PERIOD 
when people are asked about these two different jobs :COLON a job where you make 60k ,COMMA then 50k ,COMMA then 40k ,COMMA a job where you're getting a salary cut each year ,COMMA and one in which you're getting a salary increase ,COMMA people like the second job better than the first ,COMMA despite the fact they're all told they make much less money .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
assuming you wanted to go to hawaii ,COMMA would you buy this package ?QUESTIONMARK 
most people say they would .PERIOD here's a slightly different story :COLON $2000 hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA so you decide to mull it over for a week .PERIOD 
by the time you get to the ticket agency ,COMMA the best fares are gone -- the package now costs <NUM> .PERIOD would you buy it ?QUESTIONMARK most people say ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because it used to cost <NUM> ,COMMA and there's no way i'm paying <NUM> for something that was <NUM> last week .PERIOD 
here's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions .PERIOD 
imagine that you're going to the theater .PERIOD 
you're on your way to the theater .PERIOD 
in your wallet you have a ticket ,COMMA for which you paid <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
you also have a 20-dollar bill .PERIOD 
when you arrive at the theater ,COMMA you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket .PERIOD 
would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?QUESTIONMARK 
most people answer ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let's just change one thing in this scenario .PERIOD 
you're on your way to the theater ,COMMA and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills .PERIOD 
when you arrive you discover you've lost one of them .PERIOD 
would you spend your remaining <NUM> dollars on a ticket ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i went to the theater to see the play .PERIOD 
what does the loss of <NUM> dollars along the way have to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
along the way ,COMMA you lost something .PERIOD 
in both cases ,COMMA it was a piece of paper .PERIOD 
in one case ,COMMA it had a us .PERIOD president on it ;SEMICOLON in the other case it didn't .PERIOD 
what the hell difference should it make ?QUESTIONMARK 
you compare the cost of the play now -- <NUM> dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- <NUM> dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal .PERIOD 
comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people's attempts to assign value .PERIOD 
but even when we compare with the possible ,COMMA instead of the past ,COMMA we still make certain kinds of mistakes .PERIOD 
and i'm going to show you one or two of them .PERIOD 
one of the things we know about comparison :COLON that when we compare one thing to the other ,COMMA it changes its value .PERIOD 
so in <NUM> ,COMMA this fellow ,COMMA george bush ,COMMA for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum ,COMMA didn't seem like such a great guy .PERIOD 
suddenly ,COMMA we're almost longing for him to return .PERIOD 
the comparison changes how we evaluate him .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA retailers knew this long before anybody else did ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money .PERIOD 
and so a retailer ,COMMA if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine ,COMMA and you see them here for eight ,COMMA <NUM> and <NUM> dollars ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
most people don't want the most expensive ,COMMA they don't want the least expensive .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they will opt for the item in the middle .PERIOD 
if you're a smart retailer ,COMMA then ,COMMA you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf ,COMMA because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison .PERIOD 
so i'm telling you something you already knew :COLON namely ,COMMA that comparison changes the value of things .PERIOD 
here's why that's a problem :COLON the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home ,COMMA it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to .PERIOD 
the comparisons we make when we are appraising value ,COMMA where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things ,COMMA are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them .PERIOD 
this problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions .PERIOD 
let me just give you an example .PERIOD 
i have to show you something from my own lab ,COMMA so let me sneak this in .PERIOD 
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions :COLON how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?QUESTIONMARK 
they're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .PERIOD 
for some of the subjects ,COMMA sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of godiva chocolates ,COMMA and for others is a can of spam .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips .PERIOD 
namely ,COMMA those who are looking at spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty ;SEMICOLON those who are looking at godiva chocolate think they won't be nearly so tasty .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA what happens when they eat the potato chips ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA look ,COMMA you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy ,COMMA salty ,COMMA crispy ,COMMA delicious snacks ,COMMA what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience .PERIOD 
you've all experienced this yourself ,COMMA even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips .PERIOD so here's a question :COLON you want to buy a car stereo .PERIOD 
the dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for <NUM> dollars ,COMMA but if you drive across town ,COMMA you can get it for <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
so would you drive to get <NUM> percent off ,COMMA saving <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
most people say they would .PERIOD 
they can't imagine buying it for twice the price when ,COMMA with one trip across town ,COMMA they can get it for half off .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo ,COMMA and the dealer near your house had it for <NUM> .PERIOD 
but if you drove across town ,COMMA you could get it for <NUM> .PERIOD 
would you drive to get it ?QUESTIONMARK at this point ,COMMA <NUM> savings -- the <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
most people say ,COMMA no ,COMMA i'm going to schlep across town to save <NUM> bucks on the purchase of a car ?QUESTIONMARK 
this kind of thinking drives economists crazy ,COMMA and it should .PERIOD 
because this <NUM> dollars that you save -- hello !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- doesn't know where it came from .PERIOD 
it doesn't know what you saved it on .PERIOD 
that's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking <NUM> percent or <NUM> percent of their investment ,COMMA but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA this is the problem of shifting comparisons ,COMMA because what you're doing is ,COMMA you're comparing the <NUM> bucks to the purchase that you're making ,COMMA but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison .PERIOD 
you've all had this experience .PERIOD 
if you're an american ,COMMA for example ,COMMA you've probably traveled in france .PERIOD 
and at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown ,COMMA and you thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA these people are so warm .PERIOD they're so nice to me .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA compared to all these people who hate me when i try to speak their language and hate me more when i don't ,COMMA these people are just wonderful .PERIOD and so you tour france with them ,COMMA and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner ,COMMA and what do you find ?QUESTIONMARK 
compared to your regular friends ,COMMA they are boring and dull ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK because in this new context ,COMMA the comparison is very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for french citizenship .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo .PERIOD 
you go to the stereo store ,COMMA you see two sets of speakers -- these big ,COMMA boxy ,COMMA monoliths ,COMMA and these little ,COMMA sleek speakers ,COMMA and you play them ,COMMA and you go ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i do hear a difference :COLON the big ones sound a little better .PERIOD 
and so you buy them ,COMMA and you bring them home ,COMMA and you entirely violate the décor of your house .PERIOD 
and the problem ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you'll never make again .PERIOD 
what are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go ,COMMA sounds so much better than those little ones ,COMMA which you can't even remember hearing .PERIOD 
the problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time .PERIOD 
people have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time .PERIOD 
and what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules .PERIOD 
so let me give you one very easy problem ,COMMA a second very easy problem and then a third ,COMMA hard ,COMMA problem .PERIOD 
here's the first easy problem :COLON you can have <NUM> dollars now or <NUM> dollars now .PERIOD which would you prefer ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is what we call a one-item iq test ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
all of us ,COMMA i hope ,COMMA prefer more money ,COMMA and the reason is ,COMMA we believe more is better than less .PERIOD 
here's the second problem :COLON you can have <NUM> dollars today or <NUM> dollars in a month .PERIOD which would you prefer ?QUESTIONMARK 
again ,COMMA an easy decision ,COMMA because we all know that now is better than later .PERIOD 
what's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA when you're offered <NUM> dollars now or <NUM> dollars in a month .PERIOD 
this typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting ,COMMA but you have to be patient .PERIOD 
what do we know ?QUESTIONMARK what do people do in these kinds of situations ?QUESTIONMARK 
that is ,COMMA they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
maybe that isn't so remarkable ,COMMA but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen .PERIOD 
what do we find now ?QUESTIONMARK 
people are gladly willing to wait :COLON as long as they're waiting <NUM> ,COMMA they might as well wait <NUM> .PERIOD 
what makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
comparison .PERIOD troubling comparison .PERIOD let me show you .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why in the world do you get this pattern of results ?QUESTIONMARK 
these guys can tell us .PERIOD 
what you see here are two lads ,COMMA one of them larger than the other :COLON the fireman and the fiddler .PERIOD 
they are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon ,COMMA and i want you to notice two things .PERIOD 
at no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler .PERIOD no point .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .PERIOD 
first it's an inch in your view ,COMMA then it's a quarter-inch ,COMMA then a half-inch ,COMMA and then finally they go off the edge of the earth .PERIOD 
here are the results of what i just showed you .PERIOD 
this is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points .PERIOD 
and i want you to see that two things are true .PERIOD 
one ,COMMA the farther away they are ,COMMA the smaller they look ;SEMICOLON and two ,COMMA the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler .PERIOD 
but watch what happens when we make some of them disappear .PERIOD right .PERIOD 
at a very close distance ,COMMA the fiddler looks taller than the fireman ,COMMA but at a far distance their normal ,COMMA their true ,COMMA relations are preserved .PERIOD 
as plato said ,COMMA what space is to size ,COMMA time is to value .PERIOD 
these are the results of the hard problem i gave you :COLON <NUM> now or <NUM> in a month ?QUESTIONMARK 
and these are subjective values ,COMMA and what you can see is ,COMMA our two rules are preserved .PERIOD 
people always think more is better than less :COLON <NUM> is always better than <NUM> ,COMMA and they always think now is better than later :COLON the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side .PERIOD 
watch what happens when we drop some out .PERIOD 
suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us .PERIOD 
we have the tendency for people to go for <NUM> dollars now over waiting a month ,COMMA but not if that decision is far in the future .PERIOD 
notice something interesting that this implies -- namely ,COMMA that when people get to the future ,COMMA they will change their minds .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA as that month <NUM> approaches ,COMMA you will say ,COMMA what was i thinking ,COMMA waiting an extra month for <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'll take the <NUM> dollars now .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the question with which i'd like to end is this :COLON if we're so damn stupid ,COMMA how did we get to the moon ?QUESTIONMARK 
because i could go on for about two hours with evidence of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value .PERIOD 
the answer to this question ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is an answer you've already heard in some of the talks ,COMMA and i dare say you will hear again :COLON namely ,COMMA that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living .PERIOD 
they were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups ,COMMA rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves ,COMMA had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today .PERIOD 
bernoulli's gift ,COMMA bernoulli's little formula ,COMMA allows us ,COMMA it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us .PERIOD 
that explains why we are so bad at using it ,COMMA but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good ,COMMA fast .PERIOD 
we are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands .PERIOD 
we have no significant predators ,COMMA we're the masters of our physical environment ;SEMICOLON the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us .PERIOD 
the only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions .PERIOD 
if we're not here in <NUM> years ,COMMA it's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young dutch fellow in <NUM> ,COMMA because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON that was remarkable .PERIOD 
we have time for some questions for dan gilbert .PERIOD one and two .PERIOD 
bill lyell :COLON would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us ,COMMA and is there some way that we could counteract that ?QUESTIONMARK 
dan gilbert :COLON i actually was consulting recently with the department of homeland security ,COMMA which generally believes that american security dollars should go to making borders safer .PERIOD 
i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events ,COMMA and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified ,COMMA rather than -- not rather than ,COMMA but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about .PERIOD 
surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and forgive me ,COMMA but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents .PERIOD 
we already know ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the united states ,COMMA more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways ,COMMA than were killed in <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
if i told you that there was a plague that was going to kill <NUM> americans next year ,COMMA you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu .PERIOD 
these are small-scale accidents ,COMMA and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play ,COMMA the kind of coverage ,COMMA that they do .PERIOD 
surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways ,COMMA and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us .PERIOD 
dan ,COMMA i'd like to hear more on this .PERIOD so ,COMMA you're saying that our response to terror is ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's a form of mental bug ?QUESTIONMARK 
talk more about it .PERIOD 
it's out-sized .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA look .PERIOD 
if australia disappears tomorrow ,COMMA terror is probably the right response .PERIOD 
that's an awful large lot of very nice people .PERIOD on the other hand ,COMMA when a bus blows up and <NUM> people are killed ,COMMA more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country .PERIOD 
is terror the right response ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by ,COMMA quote ,COMMA outsiders ?QUESTIONMARK 
what is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes .PERIOD it's a number of things ,COMMA and you hit on several of them .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA it's a human agent trying to kill us -- it's not a tree falling on us by accident .PERIOD 
second ,COMMA these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again .PERIOD 
people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there's good reason ,COMMA but sometimes people think there are .PERIOD 
so there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event ,COMMA but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read .PERIOD so there's a large role here played by the media ,COMMA who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA go to israel .PERIOD you know ,COMMA go to israel .PERIOD and a mall blows up ,COMMA and then everybody's unhappy about it ,COMMA and an hour-and-a-half later -- at least when i was there ,COMMA and i was <NUM> feet from the mall when it blew up -- i went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on .PERIOD 
and as the israeli mother said ,COMMA she said ,COMMA we never let them win by stopping weddings .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it ,COMMA shall i say ,COMMA as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .PERIOD 
but is there a rational fear that actually ,COMMA the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA of course .PERIOD so ,COMMA if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be ,COMMA there might be more and more buses of <NUM> people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened .PERIOD 
that's not my point at all .PERIOD 
i think in the case of terrorism ,COMMA it isn't .PERIOD 
and many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said ,COMMA poverty !EXCLAMATIONMARK i can't believe what poverty is doing to us .PERIOD 
people get up in the morning ;SEMICOLON they don't care about poverty .PERIOD 
it's not making headlines ,COMMA it's not making news ,COMMA it's not flashy .PERIOD 
there are no guns going off .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA if you had to solve one of these problems ,COMMA chris ,COMMA which would you solve ?QUESTIONMARK terrorism or poverty ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's a tough one .PERIOD 
poverty ,COMMA by an order of magnitude ,COMMA a huge order of magnitude ,COMMA unless someone can show that there's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come .PERIOD 
the latest i've read ,COMMA seen ,COMMA thought is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that .PERIOD 
if that turns out to be wrong ,COMMA we all look silly ,COMMA but with poverty it's a bit -- dg :COLON even if that were true ,COMMA still more people die from poverty .PERIOD 
we've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks .PERIOD is that because in the past ,COMMA in the ancient past ,COMMA we just didn't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth ,COMMA and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things ?QUESTIONMARK 
people died ;SEMICOLON so be it .PERIOD 
but if you got attacked ,COMMA that was something you could do something about .PERIOD 
is that what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves .PERIOD 
my guess is that there's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past .PERIOD but rather ,COMMA if you're looking for an evolutionary explanation ,COMMA you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is ,COMMA they're a little scared of stuff that's new and different .PERIOD 
and there's a good reason to be ,COMMA because old stuff didn't eat you .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK 
any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you've never seen before .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before ,COMMA our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated .PERIOD 
i don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to ,COMMA but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it .PERIOD 
jay walker :COLON you know ,COMMA economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets .PERIOD but i suspect you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of ,COMMA which is the error of value .PERIOD 
i know ,COMMA because i've interviewed about <NUM> lottery buyers over the years .PERIOD 
the average lottery buyer buys about <NUM> tickets a year ,COMMA so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose ,COMMA and yet she buys <NUM> tickets a year .PERIOD why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not because she is stupid or he is stupid .PERIOD 
it's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain ,COMMA and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you've lost .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA to put it another way ,COMMA for the dollar investment ,COMMA you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet ,COMMA which you cannot have a good feeling from .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses ,COMMA which is :COLON this is just a bunch of stupid people .PERIOD 
and so fundamentally ,COMMA the reason we got to the moon is ,COMMA we didn't listen to the economists .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA no ,COMMA it's a great point .PERIOD it remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery .PERIOD because remember ,COMMA people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either ,COMMA even though they don't feel great during the drawing .PERIOD 
i would disagree that people know they're not going to win .PERIOD 
i think they think it's unlikely ,COMMA but it could happen ,COMMA which is why they prefer that to the flushing .PERIOD 
but certainly i see your point :COLON that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists .PERIOD 
that isn't one of them ,COMMA for me ,COMMA but there's many others .PERIOD 
last question .PERIOD 
aubrey de grey :COLON my name's aubrey de grey ,COMMA from cambridge .PERIOD 
i work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- i work on aging -- and i'm interested in doing something about it ,COMMA as we'll all hear tomorrow .PERIOD 
i very much resonate with what you're saying ,COMMA because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever .PERIOD do you have any advice ?QUESTIONMARK 
for you or for them ?QUESTIONMARK 
adg :COLON in persuading them .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA for you in persuading them .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted .PERIOD 
but one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly .PERIOD 
one of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future .PERIOD 
to the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future ,COMMA people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA would you like to have an extra <NUM> dollars when you're <NUM> is a question that's very different than ,COMMA imagine who you'll be when you're <NUM> :COLON will you be living ,COMMA what will you look like ,COMMA how much hair will you have ,COMMA who will you be living with .PERIOD 
once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario ,COMMA suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money .PERIOD 
but these are tricks around the margins .PERIOD 
i think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency ,COMMA which is to say ,COMMA i'm here today ,COMMA and so now is more important than later .PERIOD 
dan ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD members of the audience ,COMMA that was a fantastic session .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
so for the past year and a half ,COMMA my team at push pop press and charlie melcher and melcher media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book .PERIOD 
it's called our choice and the author is al gore .PERIOD 
the book starts like this .PERIOD this is the cover .PERIOD 
as the globe spins ,COMMA we can see our location ,COMMA and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book .PERIOD 
and if we wanted to zoom into a page ,COMMA we can just open it up .PERIOD

so you can open this one .PERIOD 
most modern wind turbines consist of a large . .PERIOD 
it starts playing immediately .PERIOD 
or we can zoom out to the table of contents ,COMMA and the video keeps playing .PERIOD 
but one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics .PERIOD 
this one shows the wind potential all around the united states .PERIOD 
but instead of just showing us the information ,COMMA we can take our finger and explore ,COMMA and see ,COMMA state by state ,COMMA exactly how much wind potential there is .PERIOD 
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .PERIOD 
this is one of my favorites .PERIOD 
so this shows . .PERIOD 
when the wind is blowing ,COMMA any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery .PERIOD 
and as the wind starts dying down ,COMMA any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out .PERIOD

and he sort of ,COMMA he showed a handful of figurines .PERIOD

and we expected huge masterpieces !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
but what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man’s life ,COMMA search ,COMMA thought ,COMMA everything -- just in a reduced ,COMMA small version .PERIOD

i feel like i’m coming home to talk about what i’ve been away doing for <NUM> years .PERIOD

newton aduaka :COLON thank you .PERIOD the first clip ,COMMA really ,COMMA is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me ,COMMA and where i'm coming from in terms of cinema .PERIOD 
these are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home .PERIOD 
and that was something that i went through ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i'm still going through .PERIOD 
i've not been home for quite a while ,COMMA for about five years now .PERIOD 
i've been away <NUM> years in total .PERIOD 
and so it’s really -- it's really how suddenly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this was made in <NUM> ,COMMA which is the time of abacha -- the military dictatorship ,COMMA the worst part of nigerian history ,COMMA this post-colonial history .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is .PERIOD 
how -- and it's sort of ,COMMA perhaps romantic ,COMMA but i think beautiful ,COMMA because you just need something to hold on to ,COMMA especially in a society where you feel alienated .PERIOD 
which takes us to the next piece ,COMMA where the young man talks about lack of opportunity :COLON living as a black person in europe ,COMMA the glass ceiling that we all know about ,COMMA that we all talk about ,COMMA and his reality .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was ,COMMA again ,COMMA the time of multiculturalism in the united kingdom ,COMMA and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say ,COMMA what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what would a child -- what does a child like jamie -- the young boy -- think ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA with all this anger that's built up inside of him ?QUESTIONMARK 
what happens with that ?QUESTIONMARK 
what ,COMMA of course ,COMMA happens with that is violence ,COMMA which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA south central la .PERIOD and this kind of stuff ,COMMA and which eventually ,COMMA when channeled ,COMMA becomes ,COMMA you know ,COMMA evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in france two years ago ,COMMA where i live ,COMMA which shocked everybody ,COMMA because everyone thought ,COMMA oh well ,COMMA france is a liberal society .PERIOD 
but i lived in england for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i've lived in france for about four ,COMMA and i feel actually thrown back <NUM> years ,COMMA living in france .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA the third piece .PERIOD the third piece for me is the question :COLON what is cinema to you ?QUESTIONMARK what do you do with cinema ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's a young director ,COMMA hollywood director ,COMMA with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means .PERIOD 
i suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me .PERIOD

thank you .PERIOD just very quickly to say that my point really here ,COMMA is that while we’re making all these huge advancements ,COMMA what we're doing ,COMMA which for me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i think we should -- africa should move forward ,COMMA but we should remember ,COMMA so we do not go back here again .PERIOD 
emeka okafor :COLON thank you ,COMMA newton .PERIOD 
one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers .PERIOD 
and considering where you are coming from ,COMMA and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously as it should be ,COMMA what would you have to say about that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i remember i met a lot of child soldiers -- ex-combatants ,COMMA as they like to be called .PERIOD 
i met psychiatrists who spent time with them ,COMMA aid workers ,COMMA ngos ,COMMA the whole lot .PERIOD 
but i remember on the flight back on my last trip ,COMMA i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself ,COMMA if any kid in the west ,COMMA in the western world ,COMMA went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through ,COMMA they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives .PERIOD 
so for me ,COMMA the thought that we have all these children -- it’s a generation ,COMMA we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage ,COMMA and africa has to live with that .PERIOD 
but i’m just saying to factor that in ,COMMA factor that in with all this great advancement ,COMMA all this pronouncement of great achievement .PERIOD 
that’s really my thinking .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we thank you again for coming to the ted stage .PERIOD 
that was a very moving piece .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
dr .PERIOD mullis was talking about his experiments ,COMMA and i realized that i almost became a scientist .PERIOD 
when i was <NUM> my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i made a hydrogen generator and i made an oxygen generator ,COMMA and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in .PERIOD

rsw :COLON . .PERIOD huh .PERIOD 
i'd like to start this session again .PERIOD 
the gentleman to my left is the very famous ,COMMA perhaps overly famous ,COMMA frank gehry .PERIOD 
and frank ,COMMA you've come to a place in your life ,COMMA which is astonishing .PERIOD 
i mean you have become ,COMMA whether you can giggle at it because it's a funny . .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's a strange thought ,COMMA but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building ,COMMA it can be used in ads -- and you've had not rock star status ,COMMA but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life .PERIOD 
and i know the road was extremely difficult .PERIOD 
and it didn't seem ,COMMA at least ,COMMA that your sell outs ,COMMA whatever they were ,COMMA were very big .PERIOD 
you kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent on working for somebody .PERIOD 
but that's an interesting thing for a creative person .PERIOD 
a lot of us work for people ;SEMICOLON we're in the hands of other people .PERIOD 
and that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session -- it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity :COLON how to do work that's big enough and not sell out .PERIOD 
and you've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big ,COMMA triply big .PERIOD 
it's not quite a question but you can comment on it .PERIOD 
it's a big issue .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i've always just . .PERIOD 
i've never really gone out looking for work .PERIOD 
i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head .PERIOD 
and when i started out ,COMMA i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff .PERIOD 
but i couldn't do anything else .PERIOD 
that was my response to the people in the time .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA it was responding to clients that i had who didn't have very much money ,COMMA so they couldn't afford very much .PERIOD 
i think it was circumstantial .PERIOD 
until i got to my house ,COMMA where the client was my wife .PERIOD 
we bought this tiny little bungalow in santa monica and for like <NUM> grand i built a house around it .PERIOD 
and a few people got excited about it .PERIOD 
i was visiting with an artist ,COMMA michael heizer ,COMMA out in the desert near las vegas somewhere .PERIOD 
he's building this huge concrete place .PERIOD 
and it was late in the evening .PERIOD we'd had a lot to drink .PERIOD 
we were standing out in the desert all alone and ,COMMA thinking about my house ,COMMA he said ,COMMA did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent ,COMMA somewhere in <NUM> years somebody's going to like it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA that's probably a good idea .PERIOD 
luckily i started to get some clients that had a little more money ,COMMA so the stuff was a little more permanent .PERIOD 
but i just found out the world ain't going to last that long ,COMMA this guy was telling us the other day .PERIOD 
so where do we go now ?QUESTIONMARK 
back to -- everything's so temporary .PERIOD 
i don't see it the way you characterized it .PERIOD 
for me ,COMMA every day is a new thing .PERIOD 
i approach each project with a new insecurity ,COMMA almost like the first project i ever did ,COMMA and i get the sweats ,COMMA i go in and start working ,COMMA i'm not sure where i'm going -- if i knew where i was going ,COMMA i wouldn't do it .PERIOD 
when i can predict or plan it ,COMMA i don't do it .PERIOD 
i discard it .PERIOD 
so i approach it with the same trepidation .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA over time i have a lot more confidence that it's going to be ok .PERIOD 
i do run a kind of a business -- i've got <NUM> people and you've got to pay them ,COMMA so there's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a healthy insecurity .PERIOD 
when bilbao was finished and i looked at it ,COMMA i saw all the mistakes ,COMMA i saw . .PERIOD 
they weren't mistakes ;SEMICOLON i saw everything that i would have changed and i was embarrassed by it .PERIOD 
i felt an embarrassment -- how could i have done that ?QUESTIONMARK 
how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street ,COMMA and it appears to have a relationship -- that i started to like it .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON what's the status of the new york project ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't really know .PERIOD 
tom krens came to me with bilbao and explained it all to me ,COMMA and i thought he was nuts .PERIOD 
i didn't think he knew what he was doing ,COMMA and he pulled it off .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i think he's icarus and phoenix all in one guy .PERIOD 
he gets up there and then he . .PERIOD comes back up .PERIOD 
they're still talking about it .PERIOD 
september <NUM> generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero ,COMMA and i'm totally against that .PERIOD 
i just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on ground zero i think for a long time .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON the picture on the screen ,COMMA is that disney ?QUESTIONMARK 
rsw :COLON how much further along is it than that ,COMMA and when will that be finished ?QUESTIONMARK 
that will be finished in <NUM> -- september ,COMMA october -- and i'm hoping kyu ,COMMA and herbie ,COMMA and yo-yo and all those guys come play with us at that place .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA today most of the people i'm working with are people i really like .PERIOD 
richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me .PERIOD 
he's been a cheerleader for quite a long time .PERIOD 
nothing that you would call architecture ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so to find one ,COMMA a guy like that ,COMMA you hang on to him .PERIOD 
he's become the head of art center ,COMMA and there's a building by craig ellwood there .PERIOD 
they want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful ,COMMA minimalist ,COMMA black steel building -- and richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage .PERIOD 
i convinced him to let me bring in another architect from portugal :COLON alvaro siza .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON why did you want that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was intuitive .PERIOD 
alvaro siza grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture .PERIOD 
i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work ,COMMA and his early work had a resemblance to my early work .PERIOD 
when i came out of college ,COMMA i started to try to do things contextually in southern california ,COMMA and you got into the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that .PERIOD 
i just stopped .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA charlie moore did a bunch of it ,COMMA but it didn't feel good to me .PERIOD 
and i always felt that he should come to southern california and do a building .PERIOD 
i like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you .PERIOD 
i've done it with claes oldenburg and with richard serra ,COMMA who doesn't think architecture is art .PERIOD 
did you see that thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
rsw :COLON no .PERIOD what did he say ?QUESTIONMARK 
he calls architecture plumbing .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA the siza thing .PERIOD 
it's a richer experience .PERIOD 
it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians -- it's similar to that i would imagine -- where you . .PERIOD huh ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON liquid architecture .PERIOD 
liquid architecture .PERIOD 
and i think for me ,COMMA it's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON is it going to be near the current campus ?QUESTIONMARK 
or is it going to be down near . .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA it's near the current campus .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA he's that kind of patron .PERIOD 
it's not his money ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON what's his schedule on that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know .PERIOD 
what's the schedule ,COMMA richard ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment ,COMMA and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other's work and play off each other ,COMMA you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect .PERIOD 
like the rockefeller center model ,COMMA which is kind of from another era .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON i found the most remarkable thing .PERIOD 
my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building ,COMMA you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces .PERIOD 
the surprise of bilbao was in its context to the city .PERIOD 
that was the surprise of going across the river ,COMMA of going on the highway around it ,COMMA of walking down the street and finding it .PERIOD 
that was the real surprise of bilbao .PERIOD 
but you know ,COMMA richard ,COMMA most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know ,COMMA you get up and you talk about your work ,COMMA and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy by saying ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm worried about the context ,COMMA i'm worried about the city ,COMMA i'm worried about my client ,COMMA i worry about budget ,COMMA that i'm on time .PERIOD 
blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah and all that stuff .PERIOD 
and it's like cleansing yourself so that you can . .PERIOD 
by saying all that ,COMMA it means your work is good somehow .PERIOD 
and i think everybody -- i mean that should be a matter of fact ,COMMA like gravity .PERIOD 
you're not going to defy gravity .PERIOD 
you've got to work with the building department .PERIOD 
if you don't meet the budgets ,COMMA you're not going to get much work .PERIOD 
if it leaks -- bilbao did not leak .PERIOD 
i was so proud .PERIOD 
the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao .PERIOD 
i met them in bilbao .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON this is the computer building ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA the computer building .PERIOD 
they were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- i noticed they were looking under things and looking for things ,COMMA and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
people put buckets out . .PERIOD 
i was clean .PERIOD there wasn't a bloody leak in the place ,COMMA it was just fantastic .PERIOD 
but you've got to -- yeah ,COMMA well up until then every building leaked ,COMMA so this . .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON frank had a sort of . .PERIOD 
ask miriam !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
 .PERIOD sort of had a fame .PERIOD his fame was built on that in la .PERIOD for a while .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA madam ,COMMA move your chair .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA some years later i was doing a building ,COMMA a little house on the beach for norton simon ,COMMA and his secretary ,COMMA who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady ,COMMA called me and said ,COMMA mr .PERIOD simon's sitting at his desk and the water's coming in on his head .PERIOD 
and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD not now either .PERIOD 
but my point is that . .PERIOD and i call it the then what ?QUESTIONMARK 
ok ,COMMA you solved all the problems ,COMMA you did all the stuff ,COMMA you made nice ,COMMA you loved your clients ,COMMA you loved the city ,COMMA you're a good guy ,COMMA you're a good person . .PERIOD 
and then what ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think that's what i've always been interested in ,COMMA is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .PERIOD 
bilbao ,COMMA i think ,COMMA shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city .PERIOD 
and i think that's the issue ,COMMA you know ;SEMICOLON it's the then what that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that .PERIOD 
they're hiring them to get it done ,COMMA get it on budget ,COMMA be polite ,COMMA and they're missing out on the real value of an architect .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON at a certain point a number of years ago ,COMMA people -- when michael graves was a fashion ,COMMA before teapots . .PERIOD 
i did a teapot and nobody bought it .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON did it leak ?QUESTIONMARK 
no .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON . .PERIOD people wanted a michael graves building .PERIOD 
is that a curse ,COMMA that people want a bilbao building ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD 
since bilbao opened ,COMMA which is now four ,COMMA five years ,COMMA both krens and i have been called with at least <NUM> opportunities -- china ,COMMA brazil ,COMMA other parts of spain -- to come in and do the bilbao effect .PERIOD 
and i've met with some of these people .PERIOD 
usually i say no right away ,COMMA but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings .PERIOD 
in one case ,COMMA i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city ,COMMA and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port .PERIOD 
i asked them what kind of building it was .PERIOD 
when you get here we'll explain it .PERIOD blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah .PERIOD 
so four of us went .PERIOD 
and they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay ,COMMA and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor .PERIOD 
each one was more beautiful than the other .PERIOD 
and then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga .PERIOD 
it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here ,COMMA and i was here ,COMMA and my guys .PERIOD 
and the guy looked at me and said ,COMMA now what can i do for you ,COMMA mr .PERIOD gehry ?QUESTIONMARK 
rsw :COLON oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD 
i said to my team ,COMMA let's get out of here .PERIOD 
we stood up ,COMMA we walked out .PERIOD 
they followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said ,COMMA you mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA nope .PERIOD 
you're not going to have dinner at all ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we get a lot of that .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA i'm old enough that i can complain i can't travel .PERIOD 
i don't have my own plane yet .PERIOD 
rsw :COLON well ,COMMA i'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long .PERIOD 
but let me just say a couple words .PERIOD 
can i say something ?QUESTIONMARK 
are you going to talk about me or you ?QUESTIONMARK 
rsw :COLON once a shit ,COMMA always a shit !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
rsw :COLON you're going to get one !EXCLAMATIONMARK you're going to get one !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i'm going to make it for you !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
no ,COMMA no .PERIOD wait a minute !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
'theme and variations' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity ,COMMA because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .PERIOD 
you might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject .PERIOD 
i was asked ,COMMA i guess about six years ago ,COMMA to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of piero della francesca .PERIOD 
and it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on piero until i realized that i could look at piero as nature -- that i would have the same attitude towards looking at piero della francesca as i would if i were looking out a window at a tree .PERIOD 
and that was enormously liberating to me .PERIOD 
perhaps it's not a very insightful observation ,COMMA but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by piero ,COMMA in this case that remarkable painting that's in the uffizi ,COMMA the duke of montefeltro ,COMMA who faces his consort ,COMMA battista .PERIOD 
once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject ,COMMA i did the following series of drawings .PERIOD 
that's the real piero della francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history .PERIOD 
and these ,COMMA i'll just show these without comment .PERIOD 
it's just a series of variations on the head of the duke of montefeltro ,COMMA who's a great ,COMMA great figure in the renaissance ,COMMA and probably the basis for machiavelli's the prince .PERIOD 
he apparently lost an eye in battle ,COMMA which is why he is always shown in profile .PERIOD 
and this is battista .PERIOD 
and then i decided i could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history ,COMMA they're facing the same direction .PERIOD 
whoops !EXCLAMATIONMARK passed each other .PERIOD 
and then a visitor from another painting by piero ,COMMA this is from the resurrection of christ -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA four large panels :COLON this is upper left ;SEMICOLON upper right ;SEMICOLON lower left ;SEMICOLON lower right .PERIOD 
incidentally ,COMMA i've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism .PERIOD 
since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there .PERIOD 
on another subject -- -- i was driving in the country one day with my wife ,COMMA and i saw this sign ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA that is a fabulous piece of design .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA what are you talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's so persuasive ,COMMA because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage ,COMMA and since most people are so suspicious of garages ,COMMA and know that they're going to be ripped off ,COMMA they use the word 'reliable' but everybody says they're reliable .PERIOD 
because as soon as you hear the word dutchman -- which is an archaic word ,COMMA nobody calls dutch people dutchmen anymore -- but as soon as you hear dutchman ,COMMA you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike ,COMMA preventing the thing from falling and flooding holland ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of dutchman .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if you think i'm exaggerating at all in this ,COMMA all you have to do is substitute something else ,COMMA like indonesian .PERIOD 
or even french .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA swiss works ,COMMA but you know it's going to cost a lot of money .PERIOD 
i'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster .PERIOD 
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts ,COMMA where i teach ,COMMA and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named silas rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says ,COMMA do something with this .PERIOD 
and so he did .PERIOD 
i could make nothing of that .PERIOD 
and i really struggled with this one .PERIOD 
and the first thing i did ,COMMA which was sort of in the absence of another idea ,COMMA was say i'll sort of write it out and make some words big ,COMMA and i'll have some kind of design on the back somehow ,COMMA and i was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something .PERIOD 
so i took another crack at it -- you've got to keep it moving -- and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board .PERIOD 
i thought that something would come out of it ,COMMA like words rule fantastic new old first last pope because it's by alexander pope ,COMMA but i sort of made a mess out of it ,COMMA and then i thought i'd repeat it in some way so it was legible .PERIOD 
sometimes ,COMMA in the middle of a resistant problem ,COMMA i write down things that i know about it .PERIOD 
but you can see the beginning of an idea there ,COMMA because you can see the word new emerging from the old .PERIOD 
there's a relationship between the old and the new ;SEMICOLON the new emerges from the context of the old .PERIOD 
and then i did some variations of it ,COMMA but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all .PERIOD 
i had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues .PERIOD 
the w was clearly a w ,COMMA the n was clearly an n ,COMMA even though they were very fragmentary and there wasn't a lot of information in it .PERIOD 
then i got the words new and old and now i had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return .PERIOD 
i was really desperate at this point .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i do something i'm truthfully ashamed of ,COMMA which is that i took two drawings i had made for another purpose and i put them together .PERIOD 
it says dreams at the top .PERIOD 
and i was going to do a thing ,COMMA i say ,COMMA well ,COMMA change the copy .PERIOD 
let it say something about dreams ,COMMA and come to sva and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA to my credit ,COMMA i was so embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA finally ,COMMA i arrived at the following solution .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it doesn't look terribly interesting ,COMMA but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters .PERIOD 
for one thing ,COMMA it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be ,COMMA which is to be understood and seen immediately ,COMMA and not explained .PERIOD 
i remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- if you have to explain it ,COMMA it ain't working .PERIOD 
and one day i woke up and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA suppose that's not true ?QUESTIONMARK 
so here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left .PERIOD 
it says ,COMMA thoughts :COLON this poem is impossible .PERIOD 
this one generates no imagery at all .PERIOD 
i am now exposing myself to my audience ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
which is something you never want to do professionally .PERIOD 
maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening .PERIOD 
what's the heart of this poem ?QUESTIONMARK 
is doing the poster this way trendy in itself ?QUESTIONMARK 
i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old ,COMMA like this .PERIOD 
and then i show you a little drawing -- you see ,COMMA you remember that old thing i discarded ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i found a way to use it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's that little alternative over there ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA not bad ,COMMA -- criticizing myself -- but more didactic than visual .PERIOD 
maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace ,COMMA a kind of dance where each defines the other .PERIOD 
and then more self-questioning -- am i being simple-minded ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this the kind of simple that looks obvious ,COMMA or the kind that looks profound ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's a significant difference .PERIOD 
this could be embarrassing .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition .PERIOD 
do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things .PERIOD 
one is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience ,COMMA and not to suggest that i am confident about what i'm doing .PERIOD 
and as you know ,COMMA you have to have a front .PERIOD 
i mean -- you've got to be confident ;SEMICOLON if you don't believe in your work ,COMMA who else is going to believe in it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that's one thing ,COMMA to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .PERIOD 
that can be a big contribution .PERIOD 
the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ;SEMICOLON you get the big one and if you don't like that ,COMMA how about the little one ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that too is a relatively new idea .PERIOD 
and here's just a series of experiments where i ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA this is a little illusion .PERIOD 
that poster is not folded .PERIOD 
it's not folded ,COMMA that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal .PERIOD 
same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA a very peculiar poster because ,COMMA simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer ,COMMA it won't sit still in the space .PERIOD 
at times ,COMMA it seems to be wider at the back than the front ,COMMA and then it shifts .PERIOD 
and if you sit here long enough ,COMMA it'll float off the page into the audience .PERIOD 
and then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective ,COMMA where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective ,COMMA but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally .PERIOD 
and another piece for the art directors' club is anna rees casting long shadows .PERIOD 
this is another poster from the school of visual arts .PERIOD 
the idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have <NUM> posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster ,COMMA all of which had a different idea of what art is .PERIOD 
but then i gave up and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA art is whatever .PERIOD 
and as soon as i said that ,COMMA i discovered that the word hat was hidden in the word whatever ,COMMA and that led me to the inevitable conclusion .PERIOD 
but then again ,COMMA it's on my list of didactic posters .PERIOD 
my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster ,COMMA in case you don't get it .PERIOD 
now this says ,COMMA note to the viewer :COLON i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time -- magritte's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery ,COMMA continuity and history .PERIOD 
i'm also convinced that ,COMMA in an age of computer manipulation ,COMMA surrealism has become banal ,COMMA a shadow of its former self .PERIOD 
the phrase 'art is whatever' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making -- a sort of 'it ain't what you do ,COMMA it's the way that you do it' notion .PERIOD 
the shadow of magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat' hidden in the word 'whatever' the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined :COLON as a thing itself ,COMMA the worth of the thing ,COMMA the shadow of the thing ,COMMA and the shape of the thing .PERIOD 
whatever .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD 
and the one that i did not submit ,COMMA which i still like ,COMMA i wanted to use the same phrase .PERIOD 
there were wonderful experiments by bruno munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of ,COMMA see how far you could go and still be able to read them .PERIOD 
and that idea stuck in my head .PERIOD 
but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course those are the remains ,COMMA and they're so labeled .PERIOD 
but what really happens is that you read it as :COLON art is whatever remains .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .PERIOD 
the first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious ,COMMA and that's that our species ,COMMA homo sapiens ,COMMA is actually really ,COMMA really smart -- like ,COMMA ridiculously smart -- like you're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now .PERIOD 
and this is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA not the first time you've probably recognized this .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA in addition to being smart ,COMMA we're also an extremely vain species .PERIOD 
so we like pointing out the fact that we're smart .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA so i could turn to pretty much any sage from shakespeare to stephen colbert to point out things like the fact that we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA there's a second observation about the human species that i want to focus on a little bit more ,COMMA and that's the fact that even though we're actually really smart ,COMMA sometimes uniquely smart ,COMMA we can also be incredibly ,COMMA incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making .PERIOD 
now i'm seeing lots of smirks out there .PERIOD 
don't worry ,COMMA i'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude .PERIOD 
and we've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face .PERIOD 
but both of these two embarrassing examples ,COMMA i think ,COMMA don't highlight what i think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make ,COMMA which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of fail blog-worthy decisions .PERIOD 
but it turns out ,COMMA what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us ,COMMA when put in certain contexts ,COMMA will actually make very specific mistakes .PERIOD 
the errors we make are actually predictable .PERIOD 
we make them again and again .PERIOD 
and they're actually immune to lots of evidence .PERIOD 
when we get negative feedback ,COMMA we still ,COMMA the next time we're face with a certain context ,COMMA tend to make the same errors .PERIOD 
and so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature .PERIOD 
what i'm most curious about is ,COMMA how is a species that's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA we're the smartest thing out there ,COMMA why can't we figure this out ?QUESTIONMARK 
in some sense ,COMMA where do our mistakes really come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
and having thought about this a little bit ,COMMA i see a couple different possibilities .PERIOD 
one possibility is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA it's not really our fault .PERIOD 
because we're a smart species ,COMMA we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super ,COMMA super complicated ,COMMA sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand ,COMMA even though we've actually created them .PERIOD 
we create financial markets that are super complex .PERIOD 
we create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with .PERIOD 
if this was the case ,COMMA we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error .PERIOD 
we'd actually just say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with ,COMMA the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those ,COMMA design things better ,COMMA and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be .PERIOD 
but there's another possibility that i find a little bit more worrying ,COMMA which is ,COMMA maybe it's not our environments that are messed up .PERIOD 
maybe it's actually us that's designed badly .PERIOD 
this is a hint that i've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors .PERIOD 
and what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD 
this is a possibility that i worry a little bit more about ,COMMA because ,COMMA if it's us that's messed up ,COMMA it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it .PERIOD 
we might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone and try to design things around it .PERIOD 
how can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two ?QUESTIONMARK 
what we need is a population that's basically smart ,COMMA can make lots of decisions ,COMMA but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have ,COMMA any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology ,COMMA human culture ,COMMA maybe even not human language .PERIOD 
and so this is why we turned to these guys here .PERIOD 
these are one of the guys i work with .PERIOD this is a brown capuchin monkey .PERIOD 
these guys are new world primates ,COMMA which means they broke off from the human branch about <NUM> million years ago .PERIOD 
this means that your great ,COMMA great ,COMMA great great ,COMMA great ,COMMA great -- with about five million greats in there -- grandmother was probably the same great ,COMMA great ,COMMA great ,COMMA great grandmother with five million greats in there as holly up here .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant ,COMMA but albeit evolutionary ,COMMA relative .PERIOD 
the good news about holly though is that she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA she's a smart ,COMMA very cut creature ,COMMA a primate as well ,COMMA but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up .PERIOD 
so she's the perfect test case .PERIOD 
does she make the same mistakes as us ?QUESTIONMARK 
does she not learn from them ?QUESTIONMARK and so on .PERIOD 
and so this is the kind of thing we decided to do .PERIOD 
my students and i got very excited about this a few years ago .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA all right ,COMMA let's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA throw so problems at holly ,COMMA see if she messes these things up .PERIOD 
first problem is just ,COMMA well ,COMMA where should we start ?QUESTIONMARK 
we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA where are we actually going to start with this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse ,COMMA around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news ,COMMA we said ,COMMA hhmm ,COMMA maybe we should actually start in the financial domain .PERIOD 
maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that ,COMMA maybe you guys don't know ,COMMA but monkeys don't actually use money .PERIOD i know ,COMMA you haven't met them .PERIOD 
but this is why ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the atm -- you know ,COMMA they don't do this stuff .PERIOD 
so now we faced ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a little bit of a problem here .PERIOD 
how are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe we should just ,COMMA actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money .PERIOD 
so that's just what we did .PERIOD 
what you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that i know of of non-human currency .PERIOD 
we weren't very creative at the time we started these studies ,COMMA so we just called it a token .PERIOD 
but this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans ,COMMA to actually buy different pieces of food .PERIOD 
it doesn't look like much -- in fact ,COMMA it isn't like much .PERIOD 
like most of our money ,COMMA it's just a piece of metal .PERIOD 
as those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know ,COMMA once you get home ,COMMA it's actually pretty useless .PERIOD 
it was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it .PERIOD 
when we first gave it to them in their enclosures ,COMMA they actually kind of picked them up ,COMMA looked at them .PERIOD 
but very quickly ,COMMA the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food .PERIOD 
and so you see one of our monkeys ,COMMA mayday ,COMMA up here doing this .PERIOD 
this is a and b are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- doesn't know .PERIOD 
there's this waiting hand from a human experimenter ,COMMA and mayday quickly figures out ,COMMA apparently the human wants this .PERIOD 
hands it over ,COMMA and then gets some food .PERIOD 
it turns out not just mayday ,COMMA all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman .PERIOD 
so here's just a quick video of what this looks like .PERIOD 
here's mayday .PERIOD she's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food .PERIOD 
here's felix ,COMMA i think .PERIOD he's our alpha male ;SEMICOLON he's a kind of big guy .PERIOD 
but he too waits patiently ,COMMA gets his food and goes on .PERIOD 
they're surprisingly good at this with very little training .PERIOD 
we just allowed them to pick this up on their own .PERIOD 
the question is :COLON is this anything like human money ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this a market at all ,COMMA or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick by getting monkeys to do something ,COMMA looking smart ,COMMA but not really being smart .PERIOD 
and so we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency ,COMMA if they were really using it like money ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other .PERIOD 
you might have them start paying attention to price ,COMMA paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token ,COMMA as it were .PERIOD 
do the monkeys do anything like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so our monkey marketplace was born .PERIOD 
the way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure .PERIOD 
when they get a hankering for some treats ,COMMA we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market .PERIOD 
upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because ,COMMA as the monkeys entered the door of the market ,COMMA a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from .PERIOD 
the salesmen were students from my lab .PERIOD 
they dressed differently ;SEMICOLON they were different people .PERIOD 
and over time ,COMMA they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn ,COMMA you know ,COMMA who sold what at what price -- you know ,COMMA who was reliable ,COMMA who wasn't ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little ,COMMA yellow food dish .PERIOD 
and that's what the monkey can for a single token .PERIOD 
so everything costs one token ,COMMA but as you can see ,COMMA sometimes tokens buy more than others ,COMMA sometimes more grapes than others .PERIOD 
so i'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like .PERIOD 
here's a monkey-eye-view .PERIOD monkeys are shorter ,COMMA so it's a little short .PERIOD 
but here's honey .PERIOD 
she's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently .PERIOD 
all of a sudden the market opens .PERIOD here's her choice :COLON one grapes or two grapes .PERIOD 
you can see honey ,COMMA very good market economist ,COMMA goes with the guy who gives more .PERIOD 
she could teach our financial advisers a few things or two .PERIOD 
so not just honey ,COMMA most of the monkeys went with guys who had more .PERIOD 
most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food .PERIOD 
when we introduced sales ,COMMA we saw the monkeys paid attention to that .PERIOD 
they really cared about their monkey token dollar .PERIOD 
the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools ,COMMA they basically matched ,COMMA not just qualitatively ,COMMA but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .PERIOD 
so much so that ,COMMA if you saw the monkeys' numbers ,COMMA you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .PERIOD 
and what we'd really thought we'd done is like we'd actually introduced something that ,COMMA at least for the monkeys and us ,COMMA works like a real financial currency .PERIOD 
question is :COLON do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might .PERIOD 
one thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know ,COMMA just like our own species .PERIOD 
the monkeys entered the market ,COMMA spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else .PERIOD 
the other thing we also spontaneously saw ,COMMA embarrassingly enough ,COMMA is spontaneous evidence of larceny .PERIOD 
so we said ,COMMA this looks bad .PERIOD 
can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do ?QUESTIONMARK 
one possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out ,COMMA you know ,COMMA see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years .PERIOD 
so we said ,COMMA let's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges ,COMMA or certain kinds of economic experiments .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself ,COMMA i'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action .PERIOD 
so imagine that right now i handed each and every one of you a thousand us .PERIOD dollars -- so <NUM> crisp hundred dollar bills .PERIOD 
take these ,COMMA put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it .PERIOD 
because it's yours now ;SEMICOLON you can buy whatever you want .PERIOD 
donate it ,COMMA take it ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and here's your choice :COLON you can either be risky ,COMMA in which case i'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens .PERIOD 
if it comes up heads ,COMMA you're going to get a thousand dollars more .PERIOD 
if it comes up tails ,COMMA you get nothing .PERIOD 
so it's a chance to get more ,COMMA but it's pretty risky .PERIOD 
i'm just going to give you <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
you can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately .PERIOD 
most people actually go with the play-it-safe option .PERIOD 
this seems like a good bet .PERIOD i'm going to go with that .PERIOD 
you might say ,COMMA eh ,COMMA that's not really irrational .PERIOD 
people are a little risk-averse .PERIOD so what ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the so what ?QUESTIONMARK comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently .PERIOD 
so now imagine that i give each and every one of you <NUM> dollars -- <NUM> crisp hundred dollar bills .PERIOD 
now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before .PERIOD 
think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money ,COMMA but you're going to get the same choice .PERIOD 
you can either take a risky loss -- so i'll flip a coin .PERIOD if it comes up heads ,COMMA you're going to actually lose a lot .PERIOD 
if it comes up tails ,COMMA you lose nothing ,COMMA you're fine ,COMMA get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe ,COMMA which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $100 bills ,COMMA for certain .PERIOD 
and i'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there .PERIOD 
so maybe you're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this ,COMMA which is when presented with these options ,COMMA people don't choose to play it safe .PERIOD 
the reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations the same choice .PERIOD 
it's a <NUM>/<NUM> shot of a thousand or <NUM> ,COMMA or just <NUM> dollars with certainty .PERIOD 
but people's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with .PERIOD 
so what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level .PERIOD 
one is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms .PERIOD 
you really have to do work to figure out ,COMMA well ,COMMA one option's a thousand ,COMMA <NUM> ;SEMICOLON one is <NUM> .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another .PERIOD 
so we think of things as ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i'm going to get more ,COMMA or oh ,COMMA i'm going to get less .PERIOD 
this is all well and good ,COMMA except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not .PERIOD 
and this leads to the second bias ,COMMA which economists have called loss aversion .PERIOD 
the idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red .PERIOD 
we really hate it when we have to lose out on some money .PERIOD 
that means when we're in a risk mindset -- excuse me ,COMMA when we're in a loss mindset ,COMMA we actually become more risky ,COMMA which can actually be really worrying .PERIOD 
these kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans .PERIOD 
they're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they don't want to sell at a loss .PERIOD 
if we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market ,COMMA would they do the same thing as people ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so this is what we did ,COMMA we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time .PERIOD 
and then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more ,COMMA or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got .PERIOD 
and so this is what this looks like .PERIOD 
we introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen .PERIOD 
the guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape ,COMMA so it looks pretty good .PERIOD 
but they're going to give the monkeys bonuses .PERIOD 
the guy on the left is a safe bonus .PERIOD 
all the time ,COMMA he adds one ,COMMA to give the monkeys two .PERIOD 
the guy on the right is actually a risky bonus .PERIOD 
sometimes the monkeys get two extra .PERIOD 
for a big bonus ,COMMA now they get three .PERIOD 
but this is the same choice you guys just faced .PERIOD 
do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial ,COMMA or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky ,COMMA but big ,COMMA bonus ,COMMA but risk the possibility of getting no bonus .PERIOD 
people here played it safe .PERIOD 
turns out ,COMMA the monkeys play it safe too .PERIOD 
qualitatively and quantitatively ,COMMA they choose exactly the same way as people ,COMMA when tested in the same thing .PERIOD 
you might say ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe the monkeys just don't like risk .PERIOD 
maybe we should see how they do with losses .PERIOD 
and so we ran a second version of this .PERIOD 
so they look like they're starting out with a big amount .PERIOD 
these are three grapes ;SEMICOLON the monkey's really psyched for this .PERIOD 
but now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect .PERIOD 
they guy on the left is a safe loss .PERIOD 
every single time ,COMMA he's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two .PERIOD 
the guy on the right is the risky loss .PERIOD 
sometimes he gives no loss ,COMMA so the monkeys are really psyched ,COMMA but sometimes he actually gives a big loss ,COMMA taking away two to give the monkeys only one .PERIOD 
and so what do the monkeys do ?QUESTIONMARK 
again ,COMMA same choice ;SEMICOLON they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time ,COMMA or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three .PERIOD 
the remarkable thing to us is that ,COMMA when you give monkeys this choice ,COMMA they do the same irrational thing that people do .PERIOD 
they actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started .PERIOD 
this is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains .PERIOD 
so what does all of this mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA what we've shown is that ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency ,COMMA and they do very similar things with it .PERIOD 
they do some of the smart things we do ,COMMA some of the kind of not so nice things we do ,COMMA like steal it and so on .PERIOD 
but they also do some of the irrational things we do .PERIOD 
they systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do .PERIOD 
this is the first take-home message of the talk ,COMMA which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser .PERIOD 
they're way cuter than the one at . .PERIOD you know -- don't do that ;SEMICOLON they're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have .PERIOD 
a little bad for monkey investors .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too .PERIOD 
because we've answered the question we started out with .PERIOD 
we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from .PERIOD 
and we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions ,COMMA tweak our technologies to make ourselves better .PERIOD 
but what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA maybe it's not just humans at the right side of this chain that's duncey .PERIOD 
maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA if we believe the capuchin monkey results ,COMMA means that these duncey strategies might be <NUM> million years old .PERIOD 
that's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really ,COMMA really old .PERIOD 
what do we know about other old strategies like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things ,COMMA fatty things like cheesecake .PERIOD 
you can't just shut that off .PERIOD 
you can't just look at the dessert cart as say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD that looks disgusting to me .PERIOD 
we're just built differently .PERIOD 
we're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after .PERIOD 
my guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions .PERIOD 
this means that the biases that lead investors to do badly ,COMMA that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome .PERIOD 
so that's the bad news .PERIOD the question is :COLON is there any good news ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the good news ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is what i started with at the beginning of the talk ,COMMA which is that humans are not only smart ;SEMICOLON we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom .PERIOD 
we're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know ,COMMA i flew over here in an airplane .PERIOD 
i didn't have to try to flap my wings .PERIOD 
i'm wearing contact lenses now so that i can see all of you .PERIOD 
i don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness .PERIOD 
we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means ,COMMA seemingly pretty easily .PERIOD 
and here's the rub .PERIOD 
it was camus who once said that ,COMMA man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is .PERIOD 
but the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them .PERIOD 
the hope is that you all will think about your limitations ,COMMA not necessarily as unovercomable ,COMMA but to recognize them ,COMMA accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out .PERIOD 
that might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
walk around for four months with three wishes ,COMMA and all the ideas will start to percolate up .PERIOD 
i think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes .PERIOD 
and what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK it's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important ,COMMA and really reflect on the world around us .PERIOD 
and thinking that ,COMMA can an individual actually do something ,COMMA or come up with something ,COMMA that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ?QUESTIONMARK 
inspired by nature -- that's the theme here .PERIOD 
and i think ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA that's where i started .PERIOD 
i became very interested in the landscape as a canadian .PERIOD 
so i really had a chance to experience that .PERIOD 
and i could never really understand exactly what it was ,COMMA or how it was informing me .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA was a reference point that i think i needed to have to be able to make the work that i did .PERIOD 
and i did go out ,COMMA and i did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring ,COMMA along a roadside .PERIOD 
but as a fine-art photographer i somehow felt that it wouldn't catch on out there ,COMMA that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career .PERIOD 
and i kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture ,COMMA or something of that nature ,COMMA and i couldn't get away from it .PERIOD 
so i started to think of ,COMMA how can i rethink the landscape ?QUESTIONMARK 
i decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we've transformed .PERIOD 
i had a bit of an epiphany being lost in pennsylvania ,COMMA and i took a left turn trying to get back to the highway .PERIOD 
and i ended up in a town called frackville .PERIOD 
i got out of the car ,COMMA and i stood up ,COMMA and it was a coal-mining town .PERIOD i did a <NUM> turnaround ,COMMA and that became one of the most surreal landscapes i've ever seen .PERIOD 
totally transformed by man .PERIOD 
and that got me to go out and look at mines like this ,COMMA and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that i could find .PERIOD 
and that became the baseline of what i was doing .PERIOD 
and it also became the theme that i felt that i could hold onto ,COMMA and not have to re-invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life's work ,COMMA to become something that i could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are .PERIOD 
and i think one of the things i also wanted to say in my thanks ,COMMA which i kind of missed ,COMMA was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in .PERIOD 
because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs -- to get into that place to make those photographs ,COMMA and if it wasn't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations ,COMMA i would have never made this body of work .PERIOD 
so in that respect ,COMMA to me ,COMMA i'm not against the corporation .PERIOD 
i own a corporation .PERIOD i work with them ,COMMA and i feel that we all need them and they're important .PERIOD 
but i am also for sustainability .PERIOD 
and i'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here ,COMMA but it is a slow progression .PERIOD 
so i started thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA we live in all these ages of man :COLON the stone age ,COMMA and the iron age ,COMMA and the copper age .PERIOD 
and these ages of man are still at work today .PERIOD 
there's something that we're not seeing there .PERIOD 
and it's a scary thing as well .PERIOD because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles ,COMMA and what we're doing to that landscape -- that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate .PERIOD 
and through my photographs ,COMMA i'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work ,COMMA and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image .PERIOD 
not to say ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA what is it ?QUESTIONMARK but to be challenged by it -- to say ,COMMA wow ,COMMA this is beautiful ,COMMA on one level ,COMMA but on the other level ,COMMA this is scary .PERIOD i shouldn't be enjoying it .PERIOD 
like a forbidden pleasure .PERIOD and it's that forbidden pleasure that i think is what resonates out there ,COMMA and it gets people to look at these things ,COMMA and it gets people to enter it .PERIOD and it also ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA defines kind of what i feel ,COMMA too -- that i'm drawn to have a good life .PERIOD 
i want a house ,COMMA and i want a car .PERIOD 
but there's this consequence out there .PERIOD 
and how do i begin to have that attraction ,COMMA repulsion ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's even in my own conscience i'm having it ,COMMA and here in my work ,COMMA i'm trying to build that same toggle .PERIOD 
these things that i photographed -- this tire pile here had <NUM> million tires in it .PERIOD it was the largest one .PERIOD 
it was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me ,COMMA and it caught fire about four years ago .PERIOD it's around westley ,COMMA california ,COMMA around modesto .PERIOD 
and i decided to start looking at something that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature ,COMMA in the recycling work that you're seeing here was starting to point to a direction .PERIOD to me ,COMMA it was our redemption .PERIOD 
that in the recycling work that i was doing ,COMMA i'm looking for a practice ,COMMA a human activity that is sustainable .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA listening at the conference ,COMMA there's many ,COMMA many things that are coming .PERIOD bio-mimicry ,COMMA and there's many other things that are coming on stream -- nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart .PERIOD 
and we all look forward to those things .PERIOD 
but in the meantime ,COMMA these things are scaling up .PERIOD 
these things are continuing to happen .PERIOD 
what you're looking at here -- i went to bangladesh ,COMMA so i started to move away from north america ;SEMICOLON i started to look at our world globally .PERIOD 
these images of bangladesh came out of a radio program i was listening to .PERIOD 
they were talking about exxon valdez ,COMMA and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries .PERIOD 
and that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned ,COMMA and <NUM> was going to be the pinnacle .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA my god ,COMMA wouldn't that be something ?QUESTIONMARK 
to see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand ,COMMA literally ,COMMA in third-world countries .PERIOD 
so originally i was going to go to india .PERIOD 
and i was shut out of india because of a greenpeace situation there ,COMMA and then i was able to get into bangladesh ,COMMA and saw for the first time a third world ,COMMA a view of it ,COMMA that i had never actually thought was possible .PERIOD 
<NUM> million people living in an area the size of wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense ,COMMA and the working conditions were horrible .PERIOD 
here you're looking at some oil fields in california ,COMMA some of the biggest oil fields .PERIOD and again ,COMMA i started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world i was living in was a result of having plentiful oil .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA was again something that i started building on ,COMMA and i continued to build on .PERIOD 
so this is a series i'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years ,COMMA under the heading of the oil party .PERIOD 
and for me china -- i started photographing it four years ago ,COMMA and china truly is a question of sustainability in my mind ,COMMA not to mention that china ,COMMA as well ,COMMA has a great effect on the industries that i grew up around .PERIOD 
i came out of a blue-collar town ,COMMA a gm town ,COMMA and my father worked at gm ,COMMA so i was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work .PERIOD but you know ,COMMA to see china and the scale at which it's evolving ,COMMA is quite something .PERIOD 
so what you see here is the three gorges dam ,COMMA and this is the largest dam by <NUM> percent ever attempted by man .PERIOD 
most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said ,COMMA it's just too big .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago ,COMMA they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning .PERIOD 
it took fifteen days to fill it .PERIOD 
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving <NUM> full-size cities up out of the reservoir ,COMMA and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .PERIOD 
this is a before and after .PERIOD so that was before .PERIOD 
and this is like <NUM> weeks later ,COMMA demolished by hand .PERIOD 
i think <NUM> of the buildings they used dynamite ,COMMA everything else was by hand .PERIOD that was <NUM> weeks later .PERIOD 
and this gives you an idea .PERIOD 
and it was all the people who lived in those homes ,COMMA were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working ,COMMA and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart .PERIOD 
and these are some of the images from that .PERIOD 
so i spent about three trips to the three gorges dam ,COMMA looking at that massive transformation of a landscape .PERIOD 
and it looks like a bombed-out landscape ,COMMA but it isn't .PERIOD 
what it is ,COMMA it's a landscape that is an intentional one .PERIOD 
this is a need for power ,COMMA and they're willing to go through this massive transformation ,COMMA on this scale ,COMMA to get that power .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA it's actually a relief for what's going on in china because i think on the table right now ,COMMA there's <NUM> nuclear power stations to be built .PERIOD 
there hasn't been one built in north america for <NUM> years because of the nimby problem -- not in my backyard .PERIOD 
but in china they're saying ,COMMA no ,COMMA we're putting in <NUM> in the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and coal-burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly .PERIOD 
so coal itself is probably one of the largest problems .PERIOD 
and one of the other things that happened in the three gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost ;SEMICOLON some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that .PERIOD 
and <NUM> to <NUM> million people were relocated ,COMMA depending on whose statistics you're looking at .PERIOD 
and this is what they were building .PERIOD 
this is wushan ,COMMA one of the largest cities that was relocated .PERIOD 
this is the town hall for the city .PERIOD 
there were no parks ;SEMICOLON there were no green spaces .PERIOD 
very high-density living on the side of a hill .PERIOD 
and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up ,COMMA but somehow were not connecting with them .PERIOD 
here is a sign that ,COMMA translated ,COMMA says ,COMMA obey the birth control law .PERIOD 
build our science ,COMMA civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth .PERIOD 
so here ,COMMA if you look at this poster ,COMMA it has all the trappings of western culture .PERIOD 
you're seeing the tuxedos ,COMMA the bouquets .PERIOD 
but what's really ,COMMA to me ,COMMA frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background .PERIOD 
so it's like marrying up all the things that we have and it's an adaptation of our way of life ,COMMA full stop .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA when you start seeing that kind of embrace ,COMMA and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very ,COMMA very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint ,COMMA it starts to become very sobering .PERIOD 
and there's about <NUM> million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times ,COMMA and in the next <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA are expecting another <NUM> to <NUM> million people to migrate into the urban centers like shanghai and the manufacturing centers .PERIOD 
the manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms .PERIOD 
so they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms .PERIOD 
this is one of the biggest shoe factories ,COMMA the yuyuan shoe factory near shenzhen .PERIOD it has <NUM> employees making shoes .PERIOD 
this is a shift change ,COMMA one of three .PERIOD 
there's two factories of this scale in the same town .PERIOD 
the next round comes in .PERIOD it's an incredible workforce that's building there .PERIOD shanghai -- i'm looking at the urban renewal in shanghai ,COMMA and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years .PERIOD 
what's also happening in shanghai is -- china is changing because this wouldn't have happened five years ago ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD this is a holdout .PERIOD 
they're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground .PERIOD 
they won't move .PERIOD they're not negotiating .PERIOD 
and so they're holding off until they get a deal with them .PERIOD 
and they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal .PERIOD 
they're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years ,COMMA or maybe even thousands of years ,COMMA are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of shanghai .PERIOD but these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of shanghai .PERIOD 
probably the largest urban-renewal project ,COMMA i think ,COMMA ever attempted on the planet .PERIOD 
and then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with -- again ,COMMA one of my wishes ,COMMA and i never ended up going there ,COMMA was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house .PERIOD 
the kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something ,COMMA and these are called the villas .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA like right now ,COMMA they're just moving .PERIOD 
the scaffolding is still on ,COMMA and this is an e-waste area ,COMMA and if you looked in the foreground on the big print ,COMMA you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling .PERIOD 
so the industry's already growing around these new developments .PERIOD 
this is a five-level bridge in shanghai .PERIOD 
so that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by volkswagen .PERIOD 
there's <NUM> of them here ,COMMA and they're being built for most of the big cities ,COMMA beijing and shanghai ,COMMA shenzhen .PERIOD 
and this isn't even the domestic car market ;SEMICOLON this is the taxi market .PERIOD 
and what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing ,COMMA but they're all high-rises .PERIOD 
so they'll put <NUM> or <NUM> up at a time ,COMMA and they just go up in the same way as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area .PERIOD 
and the density is quite incredible .PERIOD 
and one of the things in this picture that i wanted to point out is that when i saw these kinds of buildings ,COMMA i was shocked to see that they're not using a central air-conditioning system ;SEMICOLON every window has an air conditioner in it .PERIOD 
and i'm sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about efficiencies ,COMMA but i can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .PERIOD 
and when you start looking at that ,COMMA and then you start factoring up into a city the size of shanghai ,COMMA it's literally a forest of skyscrapers .PERIOD 
it's breathtaking ,COMMA in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming .PERIOD 
and you can see in the foreground of this picture ,COMMA it's still one of the last areas that was being held up .PERIOD 
right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high-rises are now going up into that central spot .PERIOD 
so a skyscraper is built ,COMMA literally ,COMMA overnight in shanghai .PERIOD 
most recently i went in ,COMMA and i started looking at some of the biggest industries in china .PERIOD 
and this is baosteel ,COMMA right outside of shanghai .PERIOD 
this is the coal supply for the steel factory -- <NUM> square kilometers .PERIOD 
it's an incredibly massive operation ,COMMA i think <NUM> workers ,COMMA five cupolas ,COMMA and the sixth one's coming in here .PERIOD 
so they're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in china .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA looking at these images ,COMMA there's this constant ,COMMA like ,COMMA haze that you're seeing .PERIOD 
this is going to show you ,COMMA real time ,COMMA an assembler .PERIOD it's a circuit breaker .PERIOD 
<NUM> hours a day at this speed .PERIOD 
in that one ,COMMA there were <NUM> people that worked on the floor .PERIOD 
and i asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers ,COMMA and then i went and looked at each one of them for about <NUM> or <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and picked this one woman .PERIOD 
and it was just lightning fast ;SEMICOLON the way she was working was almost unbelievable .PERIOD 
there's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs .PERIOD 
that condition's going to be there for the next <NUM> to <NUM> years if they realize what they want ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> million more people coming into the cities .PERIOD 
in this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw ;SEMICOLON this is a shot of it .PERIOD 
i had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field .PERIOD 
it took me five fake tries because they were just going .PERIOD to slow them down was literally impossible .PERIOD 
they were just wound up doing these things all day long ,COMMA until the manager had to ,COMMA with a stern voice ,COMMA say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA everybody freeze .PERIOD 
it wasn't too bad ,COMMA but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .PERIOD 
this is a textile mill doing synthetic silk ,COMMA an oil byproduct .PERIOD 
and what you're seeing here is ,COMMA again ,COMMA one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills .PERIOD 
the machines are all running ,COMMA absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are .PERIOD 
and i started getting in further and further into the factories .PERIOD 
and that's a diptych .PERIOD i do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places .PERIOD 
this is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together ,COMMA pre-going into the textile mills .PERIOD 
here's something that's far more labor-intensive ,COMMA which is the making of shoes .PERIOD 
this floor has about <NUM> workers on this floor .PERIOD 
the company itself had about <NUM> employees ,COMMA and they're doing domestic shoes .PERIOD 
it was very hard to get into the international companies because i had to get permission from companies like nike and adidas ,COMMA and that's very hard to get .PERIOD 
and they don't want to let me in .PERIOD 
but the domestic was much easier to do .PERIOD 
it just gives you a sense of ,COMMA again -- and that's where ,COMMA really ,COMMA the whole migration of jobs started going over to china and making the shoes .PERIOD nike was one of the early ones .PERIOD 
it was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market .PERIOD 
this is a high-tech mobile phone :COLON bird mobile phone ,COMMA one of the largest mobile makers in china .PERIOD 
i think mobile phone companies are popping up ,COMMA literally ,COMMA on a weekly basis ,COMMA and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones .PERIOD 
this is a textile where they're doing shirts -- youngor ,COMMA the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in china .PERIOD 
and this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms .PERIOD 
everything is very efficient .PERIOD 
while setting up this shot ,COMMA people on average would spend eight to <NUM> minutes having a lunch .PERIOD 
they make coffeemakers here ,COMMA the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make <NUM> million of them in the world .PERIOD 
there's <NUM> employees .PERIOD this one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long .PERIOD 
these are just recently shot -- i just came back about a month ago ,COMMA so you're the first ones to be seeing these ,COMMA these new factory pictures i've taken .PERIOD 
so it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places .PERIOD 
the other aspect of what's happening in china is that there's a real need for materials there .PERIOD 
so a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to china by ships .PERIOD 
that's cubed metal .PERIOD this is armatures ,COMMA electrical armatures ,COMMA where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel from electrical motors out ,COMMA and recycling them .PERIOD 
this is certainly connected to california and silicon valley .PERIOD 
fifty percent of the world's computers end up in china to be recycled .PERIOD 
it's referred to as e-waste there .PERIOD 
and it is a bit of a problem .PERIOD the way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes ,COMMA which are used all through china ,COMMA but they heat up the boards ,COMMA and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components .PERIOD 
they're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components .PERIOD 
but the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards ,COMMA you can smell it a good five or <NUM> kilometers before you get there .PERIOD 
here's another operation .PERIOD it's all cottage industries ,COMMA so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches ,COMMA in their backyards ,COMMA even in their homes they're burning boards ,COMMA if there's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in china to be illegal ,COMMA doing it ,COMMA but they can't stop the product from coming in .PERIOD 
this portrait -- i'm not usually known for portraits ,COMMA but i couldn't resist this one ,COMMA where she's been through mao ,COMMA and she's been through the great leap forward ,COMMA and the cultural revolution ,COMMA and now she's sitting on her porch with this e-waste beside her .PERIOD it's quite something .PERIOD 
this is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling .PERIOD 
so that's the photographs that i wanted to show you .PERIOD 
i want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls .PERIOD 
they've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while i've been thinking .PERIOD 
one's megan ,COMMA the one of the right ,COMMA and katja there .PERIOD 
and to me the whole notion -- the things i'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress .PERIOD 
and it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world ,COMMA but it starts to go up -- because i think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in asia ,COMMA and is growing at a rapid ,COMMA rapid rate ,COMMA and so i don't think we can equalize it .PERIOD so ultimately the strategy ,COMMA i think ,COMMA here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution ,COMMA because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .PERIOD 
so part of my thinking ,COMMA and part of my wishes ,COMMA is sitting with these thoughts in mind ,COMMA and thinking about ,COMMA how is their life going to be when they want to have children ,COMMA or when they're ready to get married <NUM> years from now -- or whatever ,COMMA <NUM> years from now ?QUESTIONMARK 
and to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking -- in my work ,COMMA and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes .PERIOD 
wish one :COLON world-changing .PERIOD i want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability .PERIOD 
and it is through communications today that i believe that that is not an unreal idea .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA and i went in search -- i wanted to put what i had in mind ,COMMA hitch it onto something .PERIOD i didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere .PERIOD 
one of them i'm starting from almost nothing ,COMMA but the other one ,COMMA i wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now .PERIOD 
and worldchangingcom is a fantastic blog ,COMMA and that blog is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month .PERIOD 
and it just started about <NUM> months ago .PERIOD 
and the beauty of what's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that i like .PERIOD 
what they're doing there is that they're not -- i think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much ;SEMICOLON it's used the apocalyptic tone too much ;SEMICOLON it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out .PERIOD 
whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements ,COMMA about how to change our world in a better way ,COMMA quickly .PERIOD 
and it's looking at technology ,COMMA and it's looking at new energy-saving devices ,COMMA and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize the movement towards sustainability .PERIOD 
and so for me ,COMMA one of the things that i thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the worldchangingcom website .PERIOD 
they could be posted through the web ;SEMICOLON they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter ,COMMA or anything of that nature .PERIOD 
and what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text ,COMMA and the text is blasted all over .PERIOD 
what was unusual ,COMMA according to stephen ,COMMA is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .PERIOD 
and so in this case ,COMMA because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent ,COMMA and the kinds of questions they bring up ,COMMA that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say ,COMMA well ,COMMA what's worldchangingcom ,COMMA with these images ,COMMA have to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and hopefully inspire people to go to that website .PERIOD 
so worldchangingcom ,COMMA and building that blog ,COMMA and it is a blog ,COMMA and i'm hoping that it isn't -- i don't see it as the kind of blog where we're all going to follow each other to death .PERIOD 
this one is one that will spoke out ,COMMA and will go out ,COMMA and to start reaching .PERIOD because right now there's conversations in india ,COMMA in china ,COMMA in south america -- there's entries coming from all around the world .PERIOD 
i think there's a chance to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation about sustainability at worldchangingcom .PERIOD 
wish two is more of the bottom-up ,COMMA ground-up one that i'm trying to work with .PERIOD 
and this one is :COLON i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on ,COMMA and invent ideas on ,COMMA sustainability .PERIOD 
and one of the things that came out -- allison ,COMMA who actually nominated me ,COMMA said something earlier on in a brainstorming .PERIOD she said that recycling in canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six .PERIOD 
and you think about it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA grade four -- my wife and i ,COMMA we say age seven is the age of reason ,COMMA so they're into the age of reason .PERIOD and they're pre-puberty .PERIOD 
so it's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them .PERIOD you know what happens at puberty ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA we know that from earlier presentations .PERIOD 
so my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas .PERIOD let them understand what sustainability is ,COMMA and that they have a vested interest in it to happen .PERIOD 
and one of the ways i thought of doing it is to use my prize ,COMMA so i would take <NUM> or <NUM> dollars of the winnings ,COMMA and the rest is going to be to manage this project ,COMMA but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands .PERIOD 
but the other thing that i thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them prize targets .PERIOD 
and so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in-school project ,COMMA the best one for a household project ,COMMA or it could be the best community project for sustainability .PERIOD 
and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for in my world .PERIOD and what would happen -- it's a scalable thing .PERIOD and if we can get people to put in things -- whether it's equipment ,COMMA like a media lab ,COMMA or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools ,COMMA or schools that are with kids that age ,COMMA and make it a wide-open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them .PERIOD 
and the prize has to be a verifiable thing ,COMMA so it's not about just ideas .PERIOD 
the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them ,COMMA but the actual things have to be verifiable .PERIOD 
in that way ,COMMA what's happening is that we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking .PERIOD 
and they're going to push that up ,COMMA from the bottom -- up into ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA into the households .PERIOD and parents will be reacting to it ,COMMA and trying to help them with the projects .PERIOD 
and i think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way ,COMMA and starts to teach them .PERIOD they know about recycling now ,COMMA but they don't really ,COMMA i think ,COMMA get sustainability in all the things ,COMMA and the energy footprint ,COMMA and how that matters .PERIOD 
and to teach them ,COMMA to me ,COMMA would be a fantastic wish ,COMMA and it would be something that i would certainly put my shoulder into .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA in in my world ,COMMA the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it .PERIOD 
and i like the words ,COMMA in my world ,COMMA because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it .PERIOD 
it is my world ;SEMICOLON it's not someone else's .PERIOD i want to help it ;SEMICOLON i want to do something with it .PERIOD so i think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas ,COMMA i think ,COMMA come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project ,COMMA and do something for schools .PERIOD 
i think all schools could use extra equipment ,COMMA extra cash -- it's going to be an incentive for them to do that .PERIOD 
and these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for in my world .PERIOD 
and wish three is :COLON imax film .PERIOD so i was told i should do one for myself ,COMMA and i've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .PERIOD 
and the scale of my work ,COMMA and the kinds of ideas i'm playing with -- when i first saw an imax film ,COMMA i almost immediately thought ,COMMA there's a real resonance between what i'm trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photographer .PERIOD 
and i think there's a real possibility to reach new audiences if i had a chance .PERIOD 
so i'm looking ,COMMA really ,COMMA for a mentor ,COMMA because i just had my birthday .PERIOD 
i'm <NUM> ,COMMA and i don't have time to go back to school right now -- i'm too busy .PERIOD so i need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that ,COMMA and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this .PERIOD 
i'm a garbage man .PERIOD 
and you might find it interesting that i became a garbage man ,COMMA because i absolutely hate waste .PERIOD 
i hope ,COMMA within the next <NUM> minutes ,COMMA to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .PERIOD 
think back when you were just a kid .PERIOD 
how did look at the stuff in your life ?QUESTIONMARK 
perhaps it was like these toddler rules :COLON it's my stuff if i saw it first .PERIOD 
the entire pile is my stuff if i'm building something .PERIOD 
well after spending about <NUM> years in the recycling industry ,COMMA it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .PERIOD 
and let me tell you why i have that perspective .PERIOD 
because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff .PERIOD 
now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff ,COMMA but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the united nations estimates that there's about <NUM> billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .PERIOD 
and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth ,COMMA that number well more than doubles .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA the more developed the country ,COMMA the bigger these mountains .PERIOD 
now when you see these mountains ,COMMA most people think of garbage .PERIOD 
we see above-ground mines .PERIOD 
and the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .PERIOD 
and it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .PERIOD 
because as we've heard all week at ted ,COMMA the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .PERIOD 
and what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .PERIOD 
and the metals ,COMMA we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .PERIOD 
and the plastics ,COMMA we get from oil ,COMMA which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .PERIOD 
and these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today .PERIOD 
the good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff ,COMMA particularly in regions of the world like here in europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .PERIOD 
most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff ,COMMA if it makes it to a recycler ,COMMA are the metals .PERIOD 
to put that in perspective -- and i'm using steel as a proxy here for metals ,COMMA because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler ,COMMA probably over <NUM> percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .PERIOD 
plastics are a whole other story :COLON well less than <NUM> percent are recovered .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it's more like five percent .PERIOD 
most of it's incinerated or landfilled .PERIOD 
now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material ,COMMA have very little value .PERIOD 
but actually ,COMMA plastics are several times more valuable than steel .PERIOD 
and there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .PERIOD 
so why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?QUESTIONMARK 
well it's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .PERIOD 
they have very different densities .PERIOD 
they have different electrical and magnetic properties .PERIOD 
and they even have different colors .PERIOD 
so it's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .PERIOD 
plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .PERIOD 
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .PERIOD 
and any plastic can be any color ,COMMA as you probably well know .PERIOD 
so the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don't work for plastics .PERIOD 
another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say ,COMMA particularly from the united states ,COMMA where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling .PERIOD 
people ,COMMA for as little as a dollar a day ,COMMA pick through our stuff .PERIOD 
they extract what they can ,COMMA which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover ,COMMA which is ,COMMA again ,COMMA mostly the plastics .PERIOD 
or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .PERIOD 
now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution ,COMMA this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution .PERIOD 
i call this environmental arbitrage .PERIOD 
and it's not fair ,COMMA it's not safe and it's not sustainable .PERIOD 
now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way ,COMMA those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics ,COMMA obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics .PERIOD 
this is just one example .PERIOD 
this is a photo i took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in mumbai ,COMMA india .PERIOD 
they store the plastics on the roofs .PERIOD 
they bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these ,COMMA and people try very hard to separate the plastics ,COMMA by color ,COMMA by shape ,COMMA by feel ,COMMA by any technique they can .PERIOD 
and sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the burn and sniff technique where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic .PERIOD 
none of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .PERIOD 
and by the way ,COMMA please don't try this technique at home .PERIOD 
so what are we to do about this space-age material ,COMMA at least what we used to call a space-aged material ,COMMA these plastics ?QUESTIONMARK 
well i certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke .PERIOD 
because after all ,COMMA we're doing above-ground mining .PERIOD 
and we eventually broke the code .PERIOD 
this is the last frontier of recycling .PERIOD 
it's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the earth .PERIOD 
and we finally figured out how to do it .PERIOD 
and in the process ,COMMA we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics .PERIOD 
the traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .PERIOD 
you breakdown the molecules ,COMMA you recombine them in very specific ways ,COMMA to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .PERIOD 
and not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint ,COMMA sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .PERIOD 
well a good place to start is with waste .PERIOD 
it certainly doesn't cost as much as oil ,COMMA and it's plentiful ,COMMA as i hope that you've been able to see from the photographs .PERIOD 
and because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them ,COMMA we're using a mining approach to extract the materials .PERIOD 
we have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .PERIOD 
we have enormous energy savings .PERIOD 
i don't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save <NUM> to <NUM> percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .PERIOD 
and we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals .PERIOD 
our customers get to enjoy huge co2 savings .PERIOD 
they get to close the loop with their products .PERIOD 
and they get to make more sustainable products .PERIOD 
in the short time period i have ,COMMA i want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .PERIOD 
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .PERIOD 
they recover the metals and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials ,COMMA but predominantly plastics .PERIOD 
we take out the things that aren't plastics ,COMMA such as the metals they missed ,COMMA carpeting ,COMMA foam ,COMMA rubber ,COMMA wood ,COMMA glass ,COMMA paper ,COMMA you name it .PERIOD 
even an occasional dead animal ,COMMA unfortunately .PERIOD 
and it goes in the first part of our process here ,COMMA which is more like traditional recycling .PERIOD 
we're sieving the material ,COMMA we're using magnets ,COMMA we're using air classification .PERIOD 
it looks like the willy wonka factory at this point .PERIOD 
at the end of this process ,COMMA we have a mixed plastic composite :COLON many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .PERIOD 
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process ,COMMA and the really hard work ,COMMA multi-step separation process begins .PERIOD 
we grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .PERIOD 
and out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic :COLON one type ,COMMA one grade .PERIOD 
we then use optical sorting to color sort this material .PERIOD 
we blend it in 50000-lb .PERIOD blending silos .PERIOD 
we push that material to extruders where we melt it ,COMMA push it through small die holes ,COMMA make spaghetti-like plastic strands .PERIOD 
and we chop those strands into what are called pellets .PERIOD 
and this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .PERIOD 
this is the same material that you would get from oil .PERIOD 
and today ,COMMA we're producing it from your old stuff ,COMMA and it's going right back into your new stuff .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke ,COMMA you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products ,COMMA in your office ,COMMA or back at work in your home .PERIOD 
and these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic ,COMMA replacing virgin plastic ,COMMA to make their new products .PERIOD 
we took our clues from mother nature .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to :COLON if it's broken ,COMMA it's my stuff .PERIOD 
thank you for your time .PERIOD 
compassion :COLON what does it look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
come with me to <NUM> south bloodworth street in raleigh ,COMMA north carolina ,COMMA where i grew up .PERIOD 
if you come in you will see us :COLON evening time ,COMMA at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served .PERIOD 
since mom had eight kids ,COMMA sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were .PERIOD 
before we could eat ,COMMA she would ask ,COMMA are all the children in ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if someone happened to be missing ,COMMA we would have to ,COMMA we say ,COMMA fix a plate for that person ,COMMA put it in the oven ,COMMA then we could say grace ,COMMA and we could eat .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA while we were at the table ,COMMA there was a ritual in our family :COLON when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the pta ,COMMA or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination ,COMMA or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was ,COMMA once the announcement is made ,COMMA we must take five ,COMMA ten minutes to do what we call make over that person -- that is ,COMMA to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way .PERIOD 
for when one is honored ,COMMA all are honored .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA we had to make a report on our extended visited members ,COMMA that is ,COMMA extended members of the family ,COMMA sick and elderly ,COMMA shut in .PERIOD 
my task was ,COMMA at least once a week ,COMMA to visit mother lassiter who lived on east street ,COMMA mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue ,COMMA and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK because they were old and infirm ,COMMA and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything .PERIOD 
for mom said ,COMMA to be family ,COMMA is to care and share and to look out for one another .PERIOD 
they are our family .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA sometimes there was a bonus for going .PERIOD 
they would offer sweets or money .PERIOD 
mom says ,COMMA if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them ,COMMA you must always say ,COMMA 'nothing' and if they insist ,COMMA say ,COMMA 'whatever you mind to give me' this was the nature of being at that table .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA she indicated that if we would do that ,COMMA not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family ,COMMA but she said ,COMMA even god will smile ,COMMA and when god smiles ,COMMA there is peace ,COMMA and justice ,COMMA and joy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA at the table at <NUM> ,COMMA i learned something about compassion .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA it was a minister's family ,COMMA so we had to add god into it .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i came to think that mama eternal ,COMMA mama eternal ,COMMA is always wondering :COLON are all the children in ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we had been faithful in caring and sharing ,COMMA we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world .PERIOD 
let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion .PERIOD 
it was christmas ,COMMA and at our family ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what a morning .PERIOD 
christmas morning ,COMMA where we open up our gifts ,COMMA where we have special prayers ,COMMA and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols .PERIOD it was a very intimate moment .PERIOD 
there was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular christmas to celebrate .PERIOD 
and daddy brought elder revels to the christmas family celebration .PERIOD 
we thought he must be out of his mind .PERIOD 
this is our time .PERIOD this is intimate time .PERIOD 
this is when we can just be who we are ,COMMA and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on ,COMMA while we are still in our pjs .PERIOD 
why would daddy bring elder revels ?QUESTIONMARK 
any other time ,COMMA but not to the christmas celebration .PERIOD 
and mom overheard us and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK if you really understand the nature of this celebration ,COMMA it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love .PERIOD 
that's what the celebration is all about .PERIOD 
it's time to make space ,COMMA to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we sucked up .PERIOD 
but growing up at <NUM> ,COMMA compassion was not a word to be debated ;SEMICOLON it was a sensibility to how we are together .PERIOD 
we are sisters and brothers united together .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA like chief seattle said ,COMMA we did not spin the web of life .PERIOD 
we're all strands in it .PERIOD 
and whatever we do to the web ,COMMA we do to ourselves .PERIOD 
i see pictures ,COMMA and something says ,COMMA now ,COMMA that's compassion .PERIOD 
a harvested field of grain ,COMMA with some grain in the corners ,COMMA reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest ,COMMA but you must always leave some on the edges ,COMMA just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture .PERIOD 
talk about a picture of compassion .PERIOD 
walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled ,COMMA walking across the bridge and going into selma .PERIOD 
just a photograph .PERIOD 
arm in arm for struggle .PERIOD 
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's another picture .PERIOD here ,COMMA this one .PERIOD i really do like this picture .PERIOD 
when dr .PERIOD martin luther king ,COMMA jr .PERIOD was assassinated ,COMMA that day ,COMMA everybody in my community was upset .PERIOD 
you heard about riots all across the land .PERIOD 
bobby kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in indianapolis .PERIOD 
he insisted ,COMMA i must go .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA sitting on a flatbed truck ,COMMA the elders of the community are there ,COMMA and bobby stands up and says to the people ,COMMA i have bad news for you .PERIOD 
some of you may not have heard that dr .PERIOD king has been assassinated .PERIOD 
i know that you are angry ,COMMA and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge .PERIOD but ,COMMA he said ,COMMA what i really want you to know is that i know how you feel .PERIOD 
because i had someone dear to me snatched away .PERIOD 
i know how you feel .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .PERIOD 
i allowed my anger ,COMMA my bitterness ,COMMA my grief to simmer a while ,COMMA and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world ,COMMA and we can do that together .PERIOD 
that's a picture .PERIOD compassion ?QUESTIONMARK i think i see it .PERIOD 
i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor ,COMMA and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world .PERIOD 
he asked them to give a message ,COMMA and they each read in their own language a central affirmation ,COMMA and that was some version of the golden rule :COLON as you would that others would do unto you ,COMMA do also unto them .PERIOD 
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message .PERIOD 
one more picture while i'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church :COLON <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD last night at chagrin fall ,COMMA a newspaperman and a television guy said ,COMMA that evening ,COMMA when a service was held at the riverside church ,COMMA we carried it on our station in this city .PERIOD 
it was ,COMMA he said ,COMMA one of the most powerful moments of life together .PERIOD 
we were all suffering .PERIOD 
but you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come ,COMMA and you invited them .PERIOD 
'find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated ,COMMA when we have been despised and rejected' and they all spoke out of their own traditions ,COMMA a word about the healing power of solidarity ,COMMA one with the other .PERIOD 
i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature ,COMMA but i became a preacher .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA as a preacher ,COMMA i got a job .PERIOD i got to preach the stuff ,COMMA but i got to do it too .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA as father divine in harlem used to say to folks ,COMMA some people preach the gospel .PERIOD 
i have to tangibilitate the gospel .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the real issue is :COLON how do you tangibilitate compassion ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you make it real ?QUESTIONMARK 
my faith has constantly lifted up the ideal ,COMMA and challenged me when i fell beneath it .PERIOD 
in my tradition ,COMMA there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the good samaritan .PERIOD 
many people think of it primarily in terms of charity ,COMMA random acts of kindness .PERIOD 
but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly ,COMMA you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable .PERIOD 
the question was :COLON what is the greatest commandment ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA according to jesus ,COMMA the word comes forth ,COMMA you must love yourself ,COMMA you must love the lord your god with all your heart ,COMMA mind and soul ,COMMA and your neighbor as yourself .PERIOD 
and then the person asked ,COMMA well ,COMMA what do you mean ,COMMA 'neighbor' and he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves ,COMMA and how religious authorities went the other way ,COMMA and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way ;SEMICOLON but an unsuspecting ,COMMA despised person came along ,COMMA saw the man in need ,COMMA provided oil and wine for his wounds ,COMMA put him on his own transportation ,COMMA and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper ,COMMA take care of him .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA here ,COMMA this is the initial investment ,COMMA but if needs continue ,COMMA make sure that you provide them .PERIOD 
a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity ,COMMA but one who provides a system of sustained care -- i like that ,COMMA 'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn ,COMMA take care .PERIOD 
i think maybe it's one time when the bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all god's children would have their needs cared for ,COMMA so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks ,COMMA in regards to health ,COMMA are all the children in ?QUESTIONMARK and we could say yes .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion .PERIOD 
i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs ;SEMICOLON being concerned for housing ,COMMA for healthcare ,COMMA for the prisoners ,COMMA for the infirm ,COMMA for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off ,COMMA where they are going .PERIOD 
to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs .PERIOD 
compassion takes on a corporate dynamic .PERIOD 
i believe that whatever we did around that table at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family ,COMMA that family together that understands the nature of our unity .PERIOD 
we are one people together .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA let me explain to you what i mean when i think about compassion ,COMMA and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history .PERIOD 
we would decide to establish this charter of compassion .PERIOD 
the reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history .PERIOD 
it is the time that ,COMMA biblically ,COMMA we would speak of as the day ,COMMA or the year ,COMMA of god's favor .PERIOD 
this is a season of grace .PERIOD 
unusual things are beginning to happen .PERIOD 
please pardon me ,COMMA as a black man ,COMMA for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA there is so much more that needs to be done .PERIOD 
we need to bring health and food and education and respect for all god's citizens ,COMMA all god's children ,COMMA remembering mama eternal .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me close my comments by telling you that whenever i feel something very deeply ,COMMA it usually takes the form of verse .PERIOD 
and so i want to close with a little song .PERIOD 
i close with this song -- it's a children's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal .PERIOD 
and this is why we do it .PERIOD 
the song says ,COMMA ♫ i made heaven so happy today ,COMMA ♫ ♫ receiving god's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ when i looked up ,COMMA heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ now ,COMMA i'm so happy .PERIOD can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ i'm happy .PERIOD look at me .PERIOD i'm happy .PERIOD can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ sharing makes me happy ,COMMA makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ i'm happy .PERIOD look at me .PERIOD i'm happy .PERIOD can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ let me share my happy loving smile with you .PERIOD ♫ that's compassion .PERIOD 
and i come from a long way .PERIOD 
i've been telling a story that has been so painful for me .PERIOD 
it's been a tough journey for me ,COMMA traveling the world ,COMMA telling my story in form of a book .PERIOD 
so i have branded myself as a war child .PERIOD 
i'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now ,COMMA who have lost her children .PERIOD 
there is no newspaper to cover her pain ,COMMA and what she wants to change in this society .PERIOD 
and i'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he can't write .PERIOD 
or there is no internet ,COMMA like facebook ,COMMA myspace ,COMMA youtube ,COMMA for them to talk .PERIOD 
also one thing that kept me pushing this story ,COMMA this painful stories out ,COMMA the dreams i have ,COMMA sometimes ,COMMA is like the voices of the dead ,COMMA that i have seen would tell me ,COMMA don't give up .PERIOD keep on going .PERIOD 
because sometime i feel like stopping and not doing it ,COMMA because i didn't know what i was putting myself into .PERIOD 
well i was born in the most difficult time ,COMMA when my country was at war .PERIOD 
i saw my village burned down .PERIOD 
the world that meant a lot to me ,COMMA i saw it vanish in my face .PERIOD 
i saw my aunt in rape when i was only five .PERIOD 
my mother was claimed by the war .PERIOD 
my brothers and sisters were scattered .PERIOD 
and up to now ,COMMA me and my father were detached and i still have issues with him .PERIOD 
seeing people die every day ,COMMA my mother crying ,COMMA it's like i was raised in a violence .PERIOD 
and that made me call myself a war child .PERIOD 
and not only that ,COMMA when i was eight i became a child soldier .PERIOD 
i didn't know what was the war for .PERIOD 
but one thing i knew was an image that i saw that stuck in my head .PERIOD 
when i went to the training camp i say ,COMMA i want to kill as many muslims ,COMMA and as many arabs ,COMMA as possible .PERIOD 
the training wasn't easy ,COMMA but that was the driving force ,COMMA because i wanted to revenge for my family .PERIOD 
luckily now things have changed because i came to discover the truth .PERIOD 
what was actually killing us wasn't the muslims ,COMMA wasn't the arabs .PERIOD 
it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system ,COMMA and using religion to get what they want to get out of us ,COMMA which is the oil ,COMMA the diamond ,COMMA the gold and the land .PERIOD 
so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose :COLON should i continue to hate ,COMMA or let it go ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i happened to forgive .PERIOD now i sing music with the muslims .PERIOD i dance with them .PERIOD 
i even had a movie out called war child ,COMMA funded by muslim people .PERIOD 
so that pain has gone out .PERIOD 
but my story is huge .PERIOD 
so i'm just going to go into a different step now ,COMMA which is easier for me .PERIOD 
i'm going to give you poem called forced to sin ,COMMA which is from my album war child .PERIOD 
i talk about my story .PERIOD 
one of the journey that i tread when i was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around <NUM> .PERIOD 
and only <NUM> people survived that journey .PERIOD 
so i hope you're going to hear this .PERIOD 
my dreams are like torment .PERIOD 
voices in my brain ,COMMA of friends that was slain .PERIOD 
friends like lual who died by my side ,COMMA of starvation .PERIOD 
in the burning jungle ,COMMA and the desert plain .PERIOD 
next was i ,COMMA but jesus heard my cry .PERIOD 
as i was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade ,COMMA he gave me comfort .PERIOD 
we used to raid villages ,COMMA stealing chickens ,COMMA goats and sheeps ,COMMA anything we could eat .PERIOD 
i knew it was rude ,COMMA but we needed food .PERIOD 
and therefore i was forced to sin ,COMMA forced to sin to make a living ,COMMA forced to sin to make a living .PERIOD 
sometimes you gotta lose to win .PERIOD 
never give up .PERIOD never give in .PERIOD 
left home at the age of seven .PERIOD 
one year later ,COMMA live with an ak-47 by my side .PERIOD 
slept with one eye open wide .PERIOD 
i've seen my people die like flies .PERIOD 
but i've never seen a dead body ,COMMA at least one that i've killed .PERIOD 
guns barking like lightning and thunder .PERIOD 
as a child so young and tender ,COMMA words i can't forget i still remember .PERIOD 
i saw sergeant command raising his hand ,COMMA no retreat ,COMMA no surrender .PERIOD 
i carry the banner of the trauma .PERIOD 
war child ,COMMA child without a mama ,COMMA still fighting in the saga .PERIOD 
yet as i wage this new war i'm not alone in this drama .PERIOD 
no sit or stop ,COMMA as i reach for the top i'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop .PERIOD 
i'm on a fight ,COMMA day and night .PERIOD 
sometime i do wrong in order to make things right .PERIOD 
it's like i'm living a dream .PERIOD 
first time i'm feeling like a human being .PERIOD 
ah !EXCLAMATIONMARK the children of darfur .PERIOD 
your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you that i'm fighting for .PERIOD 
left home .PERIOD 
don't even know the day i'll ever return .PERIOD 
my country is war-torn .PERIOD 
music i used to hear was bombs and fire of guns .PERIOD 
so many people die that i don't even cry no more .PERIOD 
ask god question ,COMMA what am i here for .PERIOD 
and why are my people poor .PERIOD 
and why ,COMMA why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write ,COMMA i was learning how to fight .PERIOD 
i ate snails ,COMMA vultures ,COMMA rabbits ,COMMA snakes ,COMMA and anything that had life .PERIOD 
i know it's a shame .PERIOD but who is to be blamed ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's my story shared in the form of a lesson .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
what energized me and kept me going is the music i do .PERIOD 
i never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy .PERIOD 
so the music had been my therapy for me .PERIOD 
it's been where i actually see heaven ,COMMA where i can be happy ,COMMA where i can be a child again ,COMMA in dances ,COMMA through music .PERIOD 
so one thing i know about music :COLON music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system ,COMMA your mind ,COMMA your heart ,COMMA influence your soul and your spirit ,COMMA and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing .PERIOD 
music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg ,COMMA without even wanting to do it .PERIOD 
and so the power music has i normally compare to the power love when love doesn't see a color .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if you fall in love with a frog ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD 
one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when i was still a soldier back then .PERIOD 
i hated the people in the north .PERIOD 
but i don't know why i don't hate their music .PERIOD 
so we party and dance to their music .PERIOD 
and one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers .PERIOD 
and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music .PERIOD 
but i had this question .PERIOD 
so now i'm doing music so i know what the power of music is .PERIOD 
so what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've been in a painful journey .PERIOD 
today is day number <NUM> in which i only eat dinner .PERIOD 
i don't eat breakfast .PERIOD no lunch .PERIOD 
and i've done a campaign called lose to win .PERIOD 
where i'm losing so that i could win the battle that i'm fighting now .PERIOD 
so my breakfast ,COMMA my lunch ,COMMA i donate it to a charity that i founded because we want to build a school in sudan .PERIOD 
and i'm doing this because also it's a normal thing in my home ,COMMA people eat one meal a day .PERIOD 
here i am in the west .PERIOD i choose not to .PERIOD 
so in my village now ,COMMA kids there ,COMMA they normally listen to bbc ,COMMA or any radio ,COMMA and they are waiting to know ,COMMA the day emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school .PERIOD 
and so i made a commitment .PERIOD i say ,COMMA i'm gonna not eat my breakfast .PERIOD 
i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month ,COMMA but i've been humbled .PERIOD 
so it's taken me <NUM> days .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA no stop until we get it .PERIOD 
and like it's been done on facebook ,COMMA myspace .PERIOD 
the people are giving three dollars .PERIOD 
the lowest amount we ever got was <NUM> cents .PERIOD 
somebody donated <NUM> cents online .PERIOD 
i don't know how they did it .PERIOD 
but that moved me .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA the importance of education to me is what i'm willing to die for .PERIOD 
i'm willing to die for this ,COMMA because i know what it can do to my people .PERIOD 
education enlighten your brain ,COMMA give you so many chances ,COMMA and you're able to survive .PERIOD 
as a nation we have been crippled .PERIOD 
for so many years we have fed on aid .PERIOD 
you see a 20-years-old ,COMMA 30-years-old families in a refugee camps .PERIOD 
they only get the food that drops from the sky ,COMMA from the un .PERIOD 
so these people ,COMMA you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid .PERIOD 
if anybody want to help us this is what we need .PERIOD 
it's rain .PERIOD africa is fertile .PERIOD they can grow the crops .PERIOD 
invest in education .PERIOD 
education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything .PERIOD 
because we have all those old men that are creating wars in africa .PERIOD they will die soon .PERIOD 
but if you invest in education then we'll be able to change africa .PERIOD 
that's what i'm asking .PERIOD 
so in order to do that ,COMMA i founded a charter called gua africa ,COMMA where we put kids in school .PERIOD 
we have like <NUM> kids ,COMMA ex-child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support .PERIOD 
and i said i'm going to put it in practice .PERIOD 
and with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things .PERIOD 
that's what i want to do to change ,COMMA to make a difference in the world .PERIOD 
well now ,COMMA my time is going ,COMMA so i want to sing a song .PERIOD 
but i'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here .PERIOD 
i'm gonna sing this song ,COMMA just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference .PERIOD 
she came to my country and saw the importance of education .PERIOD 
she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women ,COMMA educating them ,COMMA educating the children ,COMMA so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society .PERIOD 
so she even ended up marrying a commander from the spla .PERIOD 
and she rescued over <NUM> child soldiers .PERIOD 
one of them happened to be me now .PERIOD 
and so at this moment i want to ask to celebrate emma with me .PERIOD 
are you guys ready to celebrate emma ?QUESTIONMARK

go save a life of a child .PERIOD 
martin luther king did not say ,COMMA i have a nightmare ,COMMA when he inspired the civil rights movements .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA i have a dream .PERIOD 
and i have a dream .PERIOD 
i have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare ,COMMA and this is going to be a challenge ,COMMA because ,COMMA if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times ,COMMA nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic .PERIOD 
i think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times ,COMMA the road .PERIOD 
it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking ,COMMA but everything is desolate ,COMMA everything is dead .PERIOD 
and just a father and son trying to survive ,COMMA walking along the road .PERIOD 
and i think the environmental movement of which i am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future .PERIOD 
for too long ,COMMA we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what's going to happen .PERIOD 
we have focused on the worst-case scenario .PERIOD 
we have focused on the problems .PERIOD 
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .PERIOD 
and any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism .PERIOD 
it's part of the fight and flight mechanism ,COMMA that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer .PERIOD 
people are freezing and running away because we're using fear .PERIOD 
and i think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .PERIOD 
what would it be like to be improving the human lot ?QUESTIONMARK 
and one of the problems that we face ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is ,COMMA an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow ,COMMA if we get the right numbers to go up ,COMMA we're going to be better off ,COMMA whether that's on the stock market ,COMMA whether that's with gdp and economic growth ,COMMA that somehow life is going to get better .PERIOD 
this is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better .PERIOD 
come on .PERIOD in the western world ,COMMA we have enough .PERIOD 
maybe some parts of the world don't ,COMMA but we have enough .PERIOD 
and we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the architect of our national accounting system ,COMMA simon kuznets ,COMMA in the 1930s ,COMMA said that ,COMMA a nation's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income .PERIOD 
but we've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA this is probably historical ,COMMA and it had its time .PERIOD 
in the second world war ,COMMA we needed to produce a lot of stuff .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of europe ,COMMA and we had to rebuild it afterwards .PERIOD 
and so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .PERIOD 
but as early as <NUM> ,COMMA this visionary man ,COMMA robert kennedy ,COMMA at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign ,COMMA gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .PERIOD 
and he finished his talk with the phrase ,COMMA that ,COMMA the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile .PERIOD 
how crazy is that ?QUESTIONMARK that our measure of progress ,COMMA our dominant measure of progress in society ,COMMA is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?QUESTIONMARK 
i believe ,COMMA if kennedy was alive today ,COMMA he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile .PERIOD 
he'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice ,COMMA sustainability and people's well-being .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .PERIOD 
this is from a global survey .PERIOD 
it's asking people ,COMMA what do they want .PERIOD 
it's there ,COMMA but it's not nearly as important as happiness ,COMMA and it's not nearly as important as love .PERIOD 
we all need to love and be loved in life .PERIOD 
it's not nearly as important as health .PERIOD 
we want to be healthy and live a full life .PERIOD 
these seem to be natural human aspirations .PERIOD 
why are statisticians not measuring these ?QUESTIONMARK 
why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms ,COMMA instead of just how much stuff we have ?QUESTIONMARK 
and really ,COMMA this is what i've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness ,COMMA how do we measure well-being ,COMMA how can we do that within environmental limits .PERIOD 
and we created ,COMMA at the organization that i work for ,COMMA the new economics foundation ,COMMA something we call the happy planet index ,COMMA because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .PERIOD 
why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what we do ,COMMA is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens .PERIOD 
that should be the goal of every nation on the planet .PERIOD 
but we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that ,COMMA and that is how many of the planet's resources we use .PERIOD 
we all have one planet .PERIOD we all have to share it .PERIOD 
it is the ultimate scarce resource ,COMMA the one planet that we share .PERIOD 
and economics is very interested in scarcity .PERIOD 
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome ,COMMA it thinks in terms of efficiency .PERIOD 
and this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .PERIOD 
it is an efficiency measure .PERIOD 
and probably the easiest way to show you that ,COMMA is to show you this graph .PERIOD 
running horizontally along the graph ,COMMA is ecological footprint ,COMMA which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet .PERIOD 
more is bad .PERIOD 
running vertically upwards ,COMMA is a measure called happy life years .PERIOD 
it's about the well-being of nations .PERIOD 
it's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .PERIOD 
it's like quality and quantity of life in nations .PERIOD 
and the yellow dot there you see ,COMMA is the global average .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's a huge array of nations around that global average .PERIOD 
to the top right of the graph ,COMMA are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being ,COMMA but they're using a lot of planet to get there .PERIOD 
they are the usa ,COMMA other western countries going across in those triangles and a few gulf states in there actually .PERIOD 
conversely ,COMMA at the bottom left of the graph ,COMMA are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically ,COMMA sub-saharan africa .PERIOD 
in hobbesian terms ,COMMA life is short and brutish there .PERIOD 
the average life expectancy in many of these countries is only <NUM> years .PERIOD 
malaria ,COMMA hiv/aids are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world .PERIOD 
but now for the good news !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
there are some countries up there ,COMMA yellow triangles ,COMMA that are doing better than global average ,COMMA that are heading up towards the top left of the graph .PERIOD 
this is an aspirational graph .PERIOD 
we want to be top left ,COMMA where good lives don't cost the earth .PERIOD 
they're latin american .PERIOD 
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven't been to .PERIOD 
maybe some of you have .PERIOD 
costa rica .PERIOD 
costa rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .PERIOD 
that is longer than in the usa .PERIOD 
they are ,COMMA according to the latest gallup world poll ,COMMA the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody ;SEMICOLON more than switzerland and denmark .PERIOD 
they are the happiest place .PERIOD 
what's going on there ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can look at some of the data .PERIOD 
their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by <NUM> .PERIOD 
they abolished the army in <NUM> -- <NUM> .PERIOD 
and they invested in social programs -- health and education .PERIOD 
they have one of the highest literacy rates in latin america and in the world .PERIOD 
and they have that latin vibe ,COMMA don't they .PERIOD 
they have the social connectedness .PERIOD 
the challenge is ,COMMA that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be north american ,COMMA might not be western european .PERIOD 
it might be latin american .PERIOD 
and the challenge ,COMMA really ,COMMA is to pull the global average up here .PERIOD 
that's what we need to do .PERIOD 
and if we're going to do that ,COMMA we need to pull countries from the bottom ,COMMA and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph .PERIOD 
and then we're starting to create a happy planet .PERIOD 
that's one way of looking at it .PERIOD 
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .PERIOD 
we don't have good data going back for every country in the world ,COMMA but for some of the richest countries ,COMMA the oecd group ,COMMA we do .PERIOD 
and this is the trend in well-being over that time ,COMMA a small increase ,COMMA but this is the trend in ecological footprint .PERIOD 
and the point really is ,COMMA is that i think ,COMMA probably everybody in this room would like society to get to <NUM> without an apocalyptic something happening .PERIOD 
it's actually not very long away .PERIOD 
it's half a human lifetime away .PERIOD 
this is not the very distant future .PERIOD 
this is what the uk .PERIOD government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .PERIOD 
that is changing our business .PERIOD 
that is changing the way we create our organizations ,COMMA we do our government policy and we live our lives .PERIOD 
and the point is ,COMMA we need to carry on increasing well-being .PERIOD 
no one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce .PERIOD 
none of us ,COMMA i think ,COMMA want human progress to stop .PERIOD 
i think we want it to carry on .PERIOD 
and i think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .PERIOD 
i think this is what they want .PERIOD they want quality of life to keep increasing .PERIOD 
they want to hold on to what they've got .PERIOD 
and if we're going to engage them ,COMMA i think that's what we've got to do .PERIOD 
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .PERIOD 
now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that ,COMMA but the point is we need to turn those curves .PERIOD 
and this is where i think we can take a leaf out of systems theory ,COMMA systems engineers ,COMMA where they create feedback loops ,COMMA put the right information at the right point of time .PERIOD 
human beings are very motivated by the now .PERIOD 
you put a smart meter in your home ,COMMA and you see how much electricity you're using right now ,COMMA how much it's costing you ,COMMA your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .PERIOD 
what would that look like for society ?QUESTIONMARK 
why is it ,COMMA on the radio news every evening ,COMMA i hear the ftse <NUM> ,COMMA the dow jones ,COMMA the dollar pound ratio -- i don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news .PERIOD 
and why do i hear that ?QUESTIONMARK 
why don't i hear how much energy britain used yesterday ,COMMA or american used yesterday ?QUESTIONMARK 
did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's how you create a collective goal .PERIOD 
you put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .PERIOD 
and we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being at a government level ,COMMA they might create national accounts of well-being .PERIOD 
at a business level ,COMMA you might look at the well-being of your employees ,COMMA which we know is really linked to creativity ,COMMA which is linked to innovation ,COMMA and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues .PERIOD 
at a personal level ,COMMA we need these nudges too .PERIOD 
maybe we don't quite need the data ,COMMA but we need reminders .PERIOD 
in the uk ,COMMA we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing .PERIOD 
what are these for happiness ?QUESTIONMARK 
what are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ?QUESTIONMARK 
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago ,COMMA a big program called the foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .PERIOD 
but a piece of work we did was on :COLON what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the first of these is to connect ,COMMA is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .PERIOD 
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do ,COMMA and energy ?QUESTIONMARK 
the fastest way out of a bad mood :COLON step outside ,COMMA go for a walk ,COMMA turn the radio on and dance .PERIOD 
being active is great for our positive mood .PERIOD 
the third one is take notice .PERIOD 
how aware are you of things going on around the world ,COMMA the seasons changing ,COMMA people around you ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ?QUESTIONMARK 
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course .PERIOD 
older people who keep learning and are curious ,COMMA they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down .PERIOD 
but it doesn't have to be formal learning ;SEMICOLON it's not knowledge based .PERIOD 
it's more curiosity .PERIOD 
it can be learning to cook a new dish ,COMMA picking up an instrument you forgot as a child .PERIOD 
keep learning .PERIOD 
and the final one is that most anti-economic of activities ,COMMA but give .PERIOD 
our generosity ,COMMA our altruism ,COMMA our compassion ,COMMA are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain .PERIOD 
we feel good if we give .PERIOD 
you can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .PERIOD 
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .PERIOD 
you measure their happiness at the end of the day ,COMMA those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves .PERIOD 
and these five ways ,COMMA which we put onto these handy postcards ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA don't have to cost the earth .PERIOD 
they don't have any carbon content .PERIOD 
and so i think it's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA martin luther king ,COMMA on the eve of his death ,COMMA gave an incredible speech .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA i know there are challenges ahead ,COMMA there may be trouble ahead ,COMMA but i fear no one .PERIOD i don't care .PERIOD 
i have been to the mountain top ,COMMA and i have seen the promised land .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA he was a preacher ,COMMA but i believe the environmental movement and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the business community ,COMMA government ,COMMA needs to go to the top of the mountain top ,COMMA and it needs to look out ,COMMA and it needs to see the promised land ,COMMA or the land of promise ,COMMA and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want .PERIOD 
and not only that ,COMMA we need to create a great transition to get there ,COMMA and we need to pave that great transition with good things .PERIOD 
human beings want to be happy .PERIOD 
pave them with the five ways .PERIOD 
and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the happy planet index .PERIOD 
and then i believe that we can all create a world we all want ,COMMA where happiness does not cost the earth .PERIOD 
on september <NUM> ,COMMA the morning of my seventh birthday ,COMMA i came downstairs to the kitchen ,COMMA where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something ,COMMA and i sort of presented myself to them in the doorway ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA happy birthday !EXCLAMATIONMARK and i said ,COMMA i'm seven .PERIOD 
and my father smiled and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know what that means ,COMMA don't you ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA that i'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents ?QUESTIONMARK and my dad said ,COMMA well ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA being seven means that you've reached the age of reason ,COMMA and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i had heard this phrase ,COMMA age of reason ,COMMA before .PERIOD 
sister mary kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school .PERIOD but when she said it ,COMMA the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession ,COMMA and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil ,COMMA and anyway ,COMMA i hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase ,COMMA age of reason .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA age of reason .PERIOD what does that mean again ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my dad said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we believe in the catholic church that god knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong ,COMMA but when you're seven ,COMMA you're old enough to know better .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you've grown up ,COMMA and reached the age of reason ,COMMA and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA oh .PERIOD wait a minute .PERIOD you mean all that time ,COMMA up till today ,COMMA all that time i was so good ,COMMA god didn't notice it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my mom said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i noticed it .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA how could i not have known this before ?QUESTIONMARK 
how could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA worst of all ,COMMA how could i not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA santa claus knows if you're naughty or nice ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
and my dad said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA but ,COMMA honey ,COMMA i think that's technically just between thanksgiving and christmas .PERIOD 
and my mother said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA bob ,COMMA stop it .PERIOD let's just tell her .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA she's seven .PERIOD julie ,COMMA there is no santa claus .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this was actually not that upsetting to me .PERIOD 
my parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus :COLON how they had talked to santa claus himself and agreed that instead of santa delivering our presents over the night of christmas eve ,COMMA like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning ,COMMA our family would give santa more time .PERIOD 
which made me very suspicious .PERIOD 
it was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style ,COMMA and my mother's handwriting was so close to santa's .PERIOD 
plus ,COMMA why would santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief .PERIOD 
i left the kitchen not really in shock about santa ,COMMA but rather i was just dumbfounded about how i could have missed this whole age of reason thing .PERIOD 
it was too late for me ,COMMA but maybe i could help someone else ,COMMA someone who could use the information .PERIOD 
the answer was clear :COLON my brother bill .PERIOD he was six .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i finally found bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground .PERIOD it was a saturday ,COMMA and he was all by himself ,COMMA just kicking a ball against the side of a wall .PERIOD 
i ran up to him and said ,COMMA bill !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
but when i got to the top of the steps ,COMMA i turned around dramatically and said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA bill ,COMMA there is no santa claus .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i didn't know it at the time ,COMMA but i really wasn't turning seven on september <NUM> .PERIOD 
for my 13th birthday ,COMMA i planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends ,COMMA but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said ,COMMA i need to speak to you privately .PERIOD 
september <NUM> is not your birthday .PERIOD it's october <NUM> .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA what ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i told them that your birthday was on september <NUM> ,COMMA and then i wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place ,COMMA so i started to tell you your birthday was september <NUM> .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA julie ,COMMA you were so ready to start school ,COMMA honey .PERIOD you were so ready .PERIOD 
i thought about it ,COMMA and when i was four ,COMMA i was already the oldest of four children ,COMMA and my mother even had another child to come ,COMMA so what i think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready ,COMMA she was so ready .PERIOD then she said ,COMMA don't worry ,COMMA julie ,COMMA every year on october <NUM> when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it ,COMMA i made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day .PERIOD 
which was comforting ,COMMA but troubling .PERIOD 
my mother had been celebrating my birthday with me ,COMMA without me .PERIOD 
what was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that i was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends ,COMMA what was most upsetting was that this meant that i was not a virgo .PERIOD 
i had a huge virgo poster in my bedroom ,COMMA and i read my horoscope every single day ,COMMA and it was so totally me .PERIOD 
and this meant that i was a libra ?QUESTIONMARK 
the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair ,COMMA sort of lounging by some water ,COMMA but the libra poster is just a huge scale .PERIOD 
this was around the time that i started filling out physically ,COMMA and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls ,COMMA and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing .PERIOD 
but i got the new libra poster ,COMMA and i started to read my new libra horoscope ,COMMA and i was astonished to find that it was also totally me .PERIOD 
it wasn't until years later ,COMMA looking back on this whole age-of-reason/change-of-birthday thing ,COMMA that it dawned on me :COLON i wasn't turning seven when i thought i turned seven .PERIOD i had a whole other month to do anything i wanted to before god started keeping tabs on me .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA life can be so cruel .PERIOD 
one day ,COMMA two mormon missionaries came to my door .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles ,COMMA and my block is -- well ,COMMA it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door .PERIOD 
sometimes i get little old ladies from the seventh day adventist church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven .PERIOD 
and sometimes i get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people if i only buy some magazine subscriptions from them .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA normally i just ignore the doorbell ,COMMA but on this day i answered .PERIOD 
and there stood two boys ,COMMA each about <NUM> ,COMMA in white starched short-sleeved shirts ,COMMA and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ,COMMA and they said they had a message for me from god .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA a message for me ?QUESTIONMARK from god ?QUESTIONMARK and they said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
don't touch my hair ,COMMA that's the thing .PERIOD 
you can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD so i sat them down and i got them glasses of water ,COMMA and after niceties they said ,COMMA do you believe that god loves you with all his heart ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA of course i believe in god ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't like that word ,COMMA heart ,COMMA because it anthropomorphizes god ,COMMA and i don't like the word ,COMMA 'his' either ,COMMA because that sexualizes god .PERIOD 
but i didn't want to argue semantics with these boys ,COMMA so after a very long ,COMMA uncomfortable pause ,COMMA i said yes ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i do .PERIOD i feel very loved .PERIOD 
and they looked at each other and smiled ,COMMA like that was the right answer .PERIOD and then they said ,COMMA do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i do .PERIOD yes ,COMMA i do .PERIOD and i was so relieved that it was a question i could answer so quickly .PERIOD 
and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA then we have a story to tell you .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA apparently in jerusalem in <NUM> bc ,COMMA everyone was completely bad and evil .PERIOD every single one of them :COLON man ,COMMA woman ,COMMA child ,COMMA infant ,COMMA fetus .PERIOD 
and god came to lehi and said to him ,COMMA put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here .PERIOD and god did lead them .PERIOD 
he led them to america .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA america ?QUESTIONMARK from jerusalem to america by boat in <NUM> bc ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
then they told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced ,COMMA and over the course of <NUM> years there were two great races of them ,COMMA the nephites and the lamanites ,COMMA and the nephites were totally ,COMMA totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA after jesus died on the cross for our sins ,COMMA on his way up to heaven he stopped by america and visited the nephites .PERIOD 
and he told them that if they all remained totally ,COMMA totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil lamanites .PERIOD 
but apparently somebody blew it ,COMMA because the lamanites were able to kill all the nephites .PERIOD 
all but one guy ,COMMA this guy named mormon ,COMMA who managed to survive by hiding in the woods .PERIOD 
and he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates ,COMMA which he then buried near palmyra ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i was just on the edge of my seat .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA what happened to the lamanites ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA they became our native americans here in the us .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA so ,COMMA you believe the native americans are descended from a people who were totally evil ?QUESTIONMARK and they said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
then they told me how this guy named joseph smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard ,COMMA and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into ,COMMA and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed egyptian into english .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA at this point i just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA even the scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about xenu ,COMMA the evil intergalactic overlord .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA then they said ,COMMA do you believe that god speaks to us through his righteous prophets ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't .PERIOD 
because i was ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA upset about this lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story ,COMMA but the truth was ,COMMA i hadn't really thought this through ,COMMA so i backpedaled a little and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what exactly do you mean by righteous ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what do you mean by prophets ?QUESTIONMARK like ,COMMA could the prophets be women ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA no .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's because god gave women a gift that is so spectacular ,COMMA it is so wonderful ,COMMA that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy .PERIOD 
what is this wonderful gift god gave women ,COMMA i wondered ?QUESTIONMARK 
maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?QUESTIONMARK 
women's longer lifespan ?QUESTIONMARK the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ?QUESTIONMARK but ,COMMA no ,COMMA it wasn't any of these gifts .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's her ability to bear children .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more ,COMMA but they had more to say .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that if you're a mormon and if you're in good standing with the church ,COMMA when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA dear -- -- that wouldn't be such a good incentive for me .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA if you'd lost a leg ,COMMA well ,COMMA you get it back .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA oh -- now ,COMMA i don't have a uterus because i had cancer a few years ago .PERIOD so ,COMMA does this mean that if i went to heaven i would get my old uterus back ?QUESTIONMARK and they said ,COMMA sure .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA i don't want it back .PERIOD i'm happy without it .PERIOD gosh .PERIOD 
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?QUESTIONMARK 
would god force you to get your old nose back ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA then they gave me this book of mormon ,COMMA and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter ,COMMA and they said they'd come back some day and check in on me ,COMMA and i think i said something like ,COMMA please don't hurry ,COMMA or maybe it was just ,COMMA please don't ,COMMA and they were gone .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so ,COMMA i initially felt really superior to these boys ,COMMA and smug in my more conventional faith .PERIOD but then ,COMMA the more i thought about it ,COMMA the more i had to be honest with myself .PERIOD 
i'm just so used to that story .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys .PERIOD 
but the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head :COLON did i believe that god loved me with all his heart ?QUESTIONMARK 
because i wasn't exactly sure how i felt about that question .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if they'd asked me ,COMMA do you feel that god loves you with all his heart ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA that would have been much different ,COMMA i think i would have instantly answered ,COMMA yes ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i feel it all the time .PERIOD i feel god's love when i'm hurt and confused ,COMMA and i feel consoled and cared for .PERIOD i take shelter in god's love when i don't understand why tragedy hits ,COMMA and i feel god's love when i look with gratitude at all the beauty i see .PERIOD 
but since they asked me that question with the word believe in it ,COMMA somehow it was all different ,COMMA because i wasn't exactly sure if i believed what i so clearly felt .PERIOD 
[sanskrit] this is an ode to the mother goddess ,COMMA that most of us in india learn when we are children .PERIOD 
i learned it when i was four at my mother's knee .PERIOD 
that year she introduced me to dance ,COMMA and thus began my tryst with classical dance .PERIOD 
since then -- it's been four decades now -- i've trained with the best in the field ,COMMA performed across the globe ,COMMA taught young and old alike ,COMMA created ,COMMA collaborated ,COMMA choreographed ,COMMA and wove a rich tapestry of artistry ,COMMA achievement and awards .PERIOD 
the crowning glory was in <NUM> ,COMMA when i received this country's fourth highest civilian award ,COMMA the padma shri ,COMMA for my contribution to art .PERIOD 
but nothing ,COMMA nothing prepared me for what i was to hear on the first of july <NUM> .PERIOD 
i heard the word carcinoma .PERIOD 
as i sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office ,COMMA i heard other words :COLON cancer ,COMMA stage ,COMMA grade .PERIOD 
until then ,COMMA cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend ,COMMA stage was what i performed on ,COMMA and grades were what i got in school .PERIOD 
that day ,COMMA i realized i had an unwelcome ,COMMA uninvited ,COMMA new life partner .PERIOD 
as a dancer ,COMMA i know the nine rasas or the navarasas :COLON anger ,COMMA valor ,COMMA disgust ,COMMA humor and fear .PERIOD 
i thought i knew what fear was .PERIOD 
that day ,COMMA i learned what fear was .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA is this it ?QUESTIONMARK is this the end of the road ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this the end of my dance ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he ,COMMA the positive soul that he is ,COMMA said ,COMMA no ,COMMA this is just a hiatus ,COMMA a hiatus during the treatment ,COMMA and you'll get back to doing what you do best .PERIOD 
i realized then that i ,COMMA who thought i had complete control of my life ,COMMA had control of only three things :COLON my thought ,COMMA my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it .PERIOD 
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you ,COMMA with the enormity of the situation ,COMMA wanting to go to a place of healing ,COMMA health and happiness .PERIOD 
i wanted to go from where i was to where i wanted to be ,COMMA for which i needed something .PERIOD 
i needed something that would pull me out of all this .PERIOD 
so i dried my tears ,COMMA and i declared to the world at large . .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA cancer's only one page in my life ,COMMA and i will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life .PERIOD 
i also declared to the world at large that i would ride it out ,COMMA and i would not allow cancer to ride me .PERIOD 
but to go from where i was to where i wanted to be ,COMMA i needed something .PERIOD 
i needed an anchor ,COMMA an image ,COMMA a peg to peg this process on ,COMMA so that i could go from there .PERIOD 
and i found that in my dance ,COMMA my dance ,COMMA my strength ,COMMA my energy ,COMMA my passion ,COMMA my very life breath .PERIOD 
but it wasn't easy .PERIOD 
believe me ,COMMA it definitely wasn't easy .PERIOD 
how do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you not despair when ,COMMA with the body ravaged by chemotherapy ,COMMA climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture ,COMMA that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ?QUESTIONMARK 
all i wanted to do was curl up and weep .PERIOD 
but i kept telling myself fear and tears are options i did not have .PERIOD 
so i would drag myself into my dance studio -- body ,COMMA mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio ,COMMA and learn everything i learned when i was four ,COMMA all over again ,COMMA reworked ,COMMA relearned ,COMMA regrouped .PERIOD 
it was excruciatingly painful ,COMMA but i did it .PERIOD 
difficult .PERIOD 
i focused on my mudras ,COMMA on the imagery of my dance ,COMMA on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself .PERIOD 
and slowly ,COMMA i moved out of that miserable state of mind .PERIOD 
but i needed something else .PERIOD 
i needed something to go that extra mile ,COMMA and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .PERIOD 
the metaphor of mahishasura mardhini ,COMMA of durga .PERIOD 
durga ,COMMA the mother goddess ,COMMA the fearless one ,COMMA created by the pantheon of hindu gods .PERIOD 
durga ,COMMA resplendent ,COMMA bedecked ,COMMA beautiful ,COMMA her <NUM> arms ready for warfare ,COMMA as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur .PERIOD 
durga ,COMMA the epitome of creative feminine energy ,COMMA or shakti .PERIOD 
durga ,COMMA the fearless one .PERIOD 
i made that image of durga and her every attribute ,COMMA her every nuance ,COMMA my very own .PERIOD 
powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training ,COMMA i brought laser-sharp focus into my dance ,COMMA laser-sharp focus to such an extent that i danced a few weeks after surgery .PERIOD 
i danced through chemo and radiation cycles ,COMMA much to the dismay of my oncologist .PERIOD 
what i had done is i had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA cancer has just been one page in my life .PERIOD 
my story is a story of overcoming setbacks ,COMMA obstacles and challenges that life throws at you .PERIOD 
my story is the power of thought .PERIOD 
my story is the power of choice .PERIOD 
it's the power of focus .PERIOD 
my story is the power of a metaphor .PERIOD 
mine was that of durga ,COMMA durga the fearless one .PERIOD 
she was also called simhanandini ,COMMA the one who rode the lion .PERIOD 
as i ride out ,COMMA as i ride my own inner strength ,COMMA my own inner resilience ,COMMA armed as i am with what medication can provide and continue treatment ,COMMA as i ride out into the battlefield of cancer ,COMMA asking my rogue cells to behave ,COMMA i want to be known not as a cancer survivor ,COMMA but as a cancer conqueror .PERIOD 
i present to you an excerpt of that work simhanandini .PERIOD 
time flies .PERIOD 
it's actually almost <NUM> years ago when i wanted to reframe the way we use information ,COMMA the way we work together :COLON i invented the world wide web .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA <NUM> years on ,COMMA at ted ,COMMA i want to ask your help in a new reframing .PERIOD 
so going back to <NUM> ,COMMA i wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system .PERIOD 
but <NUM> months later -- this is how innovation happens -- <NUM> months later ,COMMA my boss said i could do it on the side ,COMMA as a sort of a play project ,COMMA kick the tires of a new computer we'd got .PERIOD 
and so he gave me the time to code it up .PERIOD 
so i basically roughed out what html should look like :COLON hypertext protocol ,COMMA http ;SEMICOLON the idea of urls ,COMMA these names for things which started with http .PERIOD 
i wrote the code and put it out there .PERIOD 
why did i do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA it was basically frustration .PERIOD 
i was frustrated -- i was working as a software engineer in this huge ,COMMA very exciting lab ,COMMA lots of people coming from all over the world .PERIOD 
they had all sorts of different data formats ,COMMA all sorts ,COMMA all kinds of documentation systems .PERIOD 
and these were all incompatible .PERIOD 
it was just very frustrating .PERIOD 
the frustration was all this unlocked potential .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA on all these discs there were documents .PERIOD 
so if you just imagined them all being part of some big ,COMMA virtual documentation system in the sky ,COMMA say on the internet ,COMMA then life would be so much easier .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did ,COMMA it was found after he died ,COMMA his copy .PERIOD 
he had written ,COMMA vague ,COMMA but exciting ,COMMA in pencil ,COMMA in the corner .PERIOD 
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .PERIOD 
it's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .PERIOD 
but then -- ok ,COMMA when ted started ,COMMA there was no web so things like click didn't have the same meaning .PERIOD 
i can show somebody a piece of hypertext ,COMMA a page which has got links ,COMMA and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page .PERIOD 
not impressive .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on cd-roms .PERIOD 
what was difficult was to get them to imagine :COLON so ,COMMA imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine .PERIOD 
alright ,COMMA that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA some people did .PERIOD 
so yeah ,COMMA it was difficult to explain ,COMMA but there was a grassroots movement .PERIOD 
that has been the most exciting thing ,COMMA not the technology ,COMMA not the things people have done with it ,COMMA but actually the community ,COMMA the spirit of all these people getting together ,COMMA sending the emails .PERIOD 
that's what it was like then .PERIOD 
do you know what ?QUESTIONMARK it's funny ,COMMA but right now it's kind of like that again .PERIOD 
i asked everybody ,COMMA more or less ,COMMA to put their documents -- i said ,COMMA could you put your documents on this web thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you did .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
it's been a blast ,COMMA hasn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA it has been quite interesting because we've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i want you to put your data on the web .PERIOD 
turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential .PERIOD 
there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data .PERIOD 
what do you mean ,COMMA data ?QUESTIONMARK what's the difference -- documents ,COMMA data ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA documents you read ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
more or less ,COMMA you read them ,COMMA you can follow links from them ,COMMA and that's it .PERIOD 
data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer .PERIOD 
who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling's talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
he put up a slide a little bit like this .PERIOD 
because data you can't naturally use by itself but in fact ,COMMA data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it .PERIOD 
he had put it together ,COMMA combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he'd put it into this software ,COMMA which i think his son developed ,COMMA originally ,COMMA and produces this wonderful presentation .PERIOD 
and hans made a point of saying ,COMMA look ,COMMA it's really important to have a lot of data .PERIOD 
and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying ,COMMA very forcibly ,COMMA it's really important to have a lot of data .PERIOD 
so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected ,COMMA or six like he did ,COMMA but i want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data .PERIOD 
the technology is linked data ,COMMA and it's extremely simple .PERIOD 
if you want to put something on the web there are three rules :COLON first thing is that those http names -- those things that start with http :COLON -- we're using them not just for documents now ,COMMA we're using them for things that the documents are about .PERIOD 
all kinds of conceptual things ,COMMA they have names now that start with http .PERIOD 
second rule ,COMMA if i take one of these http names and i look it up and i do the web thing with it and i fetch the data using the http protocol from the web ,COMMA i will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing ,COMMA about that event .PERIOD 
who's at the event ?QUESTIONMARK whatever it is about that person ,COMMA where they were born ,COMMA things like that .PERIOD 
so the second rule is i get important information back .PERIOD 
third rule is that when i get back that information it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born ,COMMA it's got relationships .PERIOD 
data is relationships .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA data is relationships .PERIOD 
this person was born in berlin ;SEMICOLON berlin is in germany .PERIOD 
and when it has relationships ,COMMA whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it's related to is given one of those names that starts http .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i can go ahead and look that thing up .PERIOD 
so i look up a person -- i can look up then the city where they were born ;SEMICOLON then i can look up the region it's in ,COMMA and the town it's in ,COMMA and the population of it ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
so i can browse this stuff .PERIOD 
so that's it ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
that is linked data .PERIOD 
the idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that hans had ,COMMA and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting .PERIOD 
it's not just a whole lot of other plants .PERIOD 
it's not just a root supplying a plant ,COMMA but for each of those plants ,COMMA whatever it is -- a presentation ,COMMA an analysis ,COMMA somebody's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together ,COMMA and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together ,COMMA the more powerful it is .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA linked data .PERIOD 
the meme went out there .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up ,COMMA he noticed that wikipedia -- you know wikipedia ,COMMA the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA in those documents ,COMMA there are little squares ,COMMA little boxes .PERIOD 
and in most information boxes ,COMMA there's data .PERIOD 
so he wrote a program to take the data ,COMMA extract it from wikipedia ,COMMA and put it into a blob of linked data on the web ,COMMA which he called dbpedia .PERIOD 
dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up berlin ,COMMA you'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about berlin ,COMMA and they're linked together .PERIOD 
so if you pull the data from dbpedia about berlin ,COMMA you'll end up pulling up these other things as well .PERIOD 
and the exciting thing is it's starting to grow .PERIOD 
this is just the grassroots stuff again ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's think about data for a bit .PERIOD 
data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms think of the diversity of the web .PERIOD it's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there .PERIOD 
so it is with data .PERIOD i could talk about all kinds of data .PERIOD 
we could talk about government data ,COMMA enterprise data is really important ,COMMA there's scientific data ,COMMA there's personal data ,COMMA there's weather data ,COMMA there's data about events ,COMMA there's data about talks ,COMMA and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff .PERIOD 
i'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it ,COMMA so that you also see how much unlocked potential .PERIOD 
let's start with government data .PERIOD 
barack obama said in a speech ,COMMA that he -- american government data would be available on the internet in accessible formats .PERIOD 
and i hope that they will put it up as linked data .PERIOD 
that's important .PERIOD why is it important ?QUESTIONMARK 
not just for transparency ,COMMA yeah transparency in government is important ,COMMA but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in america .PERIOD 
it's actual useful .PERIOD it's got value .PERIOD 
i can use it in my company .PERIOD 
i could use it as a kid to do my homework .PERIOD 
so we're talking about making the place ,COMMA making the world run better by making this data available .PERIOD 
in fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department ,COMMA often you find that these people ,COMMA they're very tempted to keep it -- hans calls it database hugging .PERIOD 
you hug your database ,COMMA you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i'd like to suggest that rather -- yes ,COMMA make a beautiful website ,COMMA who am i to say don't make a beautiful website ?QUESTIONMARK 
make a beautiful website ,COMMA but first give us the unadulterated data ,COMMA we want the data .PERIOD 
we want unadulterated data .PERIOD 
and i'm going to ask you to practice that ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
can you say raw ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON raw .PERIOD 
tim berners-lee :COLON can you say data ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON data .PERIOD 
tbl :COLON can you say now ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON now !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
tbl :COLON alright ,COMMA raw data now !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
audience :COLON raw data now !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and it's not just america .PERIOD it's all over the world .PERIOD 
and it's not just governments ,COMMA of course -- it's enterprises as well .PERIOD 
so i'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data .PERIOD 
here we are at ted ,COMMA and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer ,COMMA understanding the brain for alzheimer's ,COMMA understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable ,COMMA understanding how the world works .PERIOD 
but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases ,COMMA often sitting in their computers ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA currently not shared .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at alzheimer's ,COMMA for example ,COMMA drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos ,COMMA because they had their genomics data in one database in one building ,COMMA and they had their protein data in another .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question ,COMMA that you probably wouldn't ask ,COMMA i wouldn't ask -- they would .PERIOD 
what proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA you take that mouthful and you put it into google .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA there's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before .PERIOD 
you get <NUM> hits -- no results you can use .PERIOD 
you ask the linked data -- which they've now put together -- <NUM> hits ,COMMA each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at .PERIOD 
the power of being able to ask those questions ,COMMA as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change .PERIOD 
it's very very important .PERIOD 
scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems .PERIOD 
now if i go on like this ,COMMA you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA that's not true .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA data is about our lives .PERIOD 
you just -- you log on to your social networking site ,COMMA your favorite one ,COMMA you say ,COMMA this is my friend .PERIOD 
bing !EXCLAMATIONMARK relationship .PERIOD data .PERIOD 
you say ,COMMA this photograph ,COMMA it's about -- it depicts this person .PERIOD bing !EXCLAMATIONMARK that's data .PERIOD data ,COMMA data ,COMMA data .PERIOD 
every time you do things on the social networking site ,COMMA the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it -- and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA when you go to another linked data site -- and let's say this is one about travel ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA i want to send this photo to all the people in that group ,COMMA you can't get over the walls .PERIOD 
the economist wrote an article about it ,COMMA and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration .PERIOD 
the way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability between social networking sites .PERIOD 
we need to do that with linked data .PERIOD 
one last type of data i'll talk about ,COMMA maybe it's the most exciting .PERIOD 
before i came down here ,COMMA i looked it up on openstreetmap the openstreetmap's a map ,COMMA but it's also a wiki .PERIOD 
zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- the terrace theater .PERIOD it didn't have a name on it .PERIOD 
so i could go into edit mode ,COMMA i could select the theater ,COMMA i could add down at the bottom the name ,COMMA and i could save it back .PERIOD 
and now if you go back to the openstreetmap .PERIOD org ,COMMA and you find this place ,COMMA you will find that the terrace theater has got a name .PERIOD 
i did that .PERIOD me !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i did that to the map .PERIOD i just did that !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i put that up on there .PERIOD hey ,COMMA you know what ?QUESTIONMARK 
if i -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs .PERIOD 
it's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit ,COMMA and it all connecting .PERIOD 
that's how linked data works .PERIOD 
you do your bit .PERIOD everybody else does theirs .PERIOD 
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .PERIOD 
and we've practiced that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA linked data -- it's huge .PERIOD 
i've only told you a very small number of things there are data in every aspect of our lives ,COMMA every aspect of work and pleasure ,COMMA and it's not just about the number of places where data comes ,COMMA it's about connecting it together .PERIOD 
and when you connect data together ,COMMA you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web ,COMMA with documents .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea .PERIOD 
and all the people -- and i think there's a lot of people at ted who do things because -- even though there's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so it's called linked data .PERIOD 
i want you to make it .PERIOD 
i want you to demand it .PERIOD 
and i think it's an idea worth spreading .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of ted is compassion ,COMMA these very moving demonstrations we've just seen :COLON hiv in africa ,COMMA president clinton last night .PERIOD 
and i'd like to do a little collateral thinking ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal .PERIOD 
i'm a psychologist ,COMMA but rest assured ,COMMA i will not bring it to the scrotal .PERIOD 
there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help ,COMMA we do sometimes ,COMMA and we don't other times .PERIOD 
a group of divinity students at the princeton theological seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic .PERIOD 
half of those students were given ,COMMA as a topic ,COMMA the parable of the good samaritan :COLON the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road .PERIOD 
half were given random bible topics .PERIOD 
then one by one ,COMMA they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon .PERIOD 
as they went from the first building to the second ,COMMA each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning ,COMMA clearly in need .PERIOD the question is :COLON did they stop to help ?QUESTIONMARK 
the more interesting question is :COLON did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the good samaritan ?QUESTIONMARK answer :COLON no ,COMMA not at all .PERIOD 
what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late ,COMMA or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about .PERIOD 
and this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the predicament of our lives :COLON that we don't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .PERIOD 
there's a new field in brain science ,COMMA social neuroscience .PERIOD 
this studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact .PERIOD 
and the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help .PERIOD 
that is to say ,COMMA if we attend to the other person ,COMMA we automatically empathize ,COMMA we automatically feel with them .PERIOD 
there are these newly identified neurons ,COMMA mirror neurons ,COMMA that act like a neuro wi-fi ,COMMA activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs .PERIOD we feel with automatically .PERIOD 
and if that person is in need ,COMMA if that person is suffering ,COMMA we're automatically prepared to help .PERIOD at least that's the argument .PERIOD 
but then the question is :COLON why don't we ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption ,COMMA to noticing ,COMMA to empathy and to compassion .PERIOD 
and the simple fact is ,COMMA if we are focused on ourselves ,COMMA if we're preoccupied ,COMMA as we so often are throughout the day ,COMMA we don't really fully notice the other .PERIOD 
and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle .PERIOD 
i was doing my taxes the other day ,COMMA and i got to the point where i was listing all of the donations i gave ,COMMA and i had an epiphany ,COMMA it was -- i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought ,COMMA boy ,COMMA my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva .PERIOD 
then i started to think about the people in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped ,COMMA and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy ,COMMA to feeling good for the people that were being helped .PERIOD i think that's a motivator .PERIOD 
but this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that i encourage us all to pay attention to .PERIOD 
you can see it at a gross level in the world of dating .PERIOD 
i was at a sushi restaurant a while back and i overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman ,COMMA who was in the singles scene .PERIOD and this woman says ,COMMA my brother is having trouble getting dates ,COMMA so he's trying speed dating .PERIOD i don't know if you know speed dating ?QUESTIONMARK 
women sit at tables and men go from table to table ,COMMA and there's a clock and a bell ,COMMA and at five minutes ,COMMA bingo ,COMMA the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up .PERIOD and this woman says ,COMMA my brother's never gotten a card ,COMMA and i know exactly why .PERIOD 
the moment he sits down ,COMMA he starts talking non-stop about himself ;SEMICOLON he never asks about the woman .PERIOD 
and i was doing some research in the sunday styles section of the new york times ,COMMA looking at the back stories of marriages -- because they're very interesting -- and i came to the marriage of alice charney epstein .PERIOD and she said that when she was in the dating scene ,COMMA she had a simple test she put people to .PERIOD 
the test was :COLON from the moment they got together ,COMMA how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word you in it .PERIOD 
and apparently epstein aced the test ,COMMA therefore the article .PERIOD 
now this is a -- it's a little test i encourage you to try out at a party .PERIOD 
here at ted there are great opportunities .PERIOD 
the harvard business review recently had an article called the human moment ,COMMA about how to make real contact with a person at work .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your blackberry ,COMMA close your laptop ,COMMA end your daydream and pay full attention to the person .PERIOD 
there is a newly coined word in the english language for the moment when the person we're with whips out their blackberry or answers that cell phone ,COMMA and all of a sudden we don't exist .PERIOD 
the word is pizzled :COLON it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off .PERIOD 
i think it's quite apt .PERIOD it's our empathy ,COMMA it's our tuning in which separates us from machiavellians or sociopaths .PERIOD 
i have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the annotated dracula ,COMMA the essential frankenstein -- he was trained as a chaucer scholar ,COMMA but he was born in transylvania and i think it affected him a little bit .PERIOD 
at any rate ,COMMA at one point my brother-in-law ,COMMA leonard ,COMMA decided to write a book about a serial killer .PERIOD 
this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago .PERIOD he was known as the santa cruz strangler .PERIOD 
and before he was arrested ,COMMA he had murdered his grandparents ,COMMA his mother and five co-eds at uc santa cruz .PERIOD 
so my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying .PERIOD 
for one thing ,COMMA he's almost seven feet tall .PERIOD 
but that's not the most terrifying thing about him .PERIOD 
the scariest thing is that his iq is <NUM> :COLON a certified genius .PERIOD 
but there is zero correlation between iq and emotional empathy ,COMMA feeling with the other person .PERIOD 
they're controlled by different parts of the brain .PERIOD 
so at one point ,COMMA my brother-in-law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to ,COMMA and that is :COLON how could you have done it ?QUESTIONMARK 
didn't you feel any pity for your victims ?QUESTIONMARK 
these were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims .PERIOD 
and the strangler says very matter-of-factly ,COMMA oh no .PERIOD if i'd felt the distress ,COMMA i could not have done it .PERIOD 
i had to turn that part of me off .PERIOD i had to turn that part of me off .PERIOD 
and i think that that is very troubling ,COMMA and in a sense ,COMMA i've been reflecting on turning that part of us off .PERIOD 
when we focus on ourselves in any activity ,COMMA we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person .PERIOD 
think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism .PERIOD 
we're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot .PERIOD 
we don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats .PERIOD 
or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient ;SEMICOLON it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill ?QUESTIONMARK in other words ,COMMA we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use .PERIOD 
in a sense ,COMMA the room itself is the elephant in the room ,COMMA but we don't see it .PERIOD and we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere .PERIOD consider this .PERIOD 
there's a wonderful book called stuff :COLON the hidden life of everyday objects .PERIOD 
and it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt .PERIOD 
and it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer .PERIOD and it mentions ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that cotton is very resistant to textile dye ;SEMICOLON about <NUM> percent washes off into wastewater .PERIOD 
and it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia .PERIOD 
there's a company ,COMMA bennett and company ,COMMA that supplies polocom ,COMMA victoria's secret -- they ,COMMA because of their ceo ,COMMA who's aware of this ,COMMA in china formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt over the non-virtuous one .PERIOD so what would it take to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i've been thinking .PERIOD for one thing ,COMMA there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store .PERIOD 
you can track it back to the factory .PERIOD once you can track it back to the factory ,COMMA you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it ,COMMA and if it's virtuous ,COMMA you can label it that way .PERIOD or if it's not so virtuous ,COMMA you can go into -- today ,COMMA go into any store ,COMMA put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode ,COMMA which will take you to a website .PERIOD 
they have it for people with allergies to peanuts .PERIOD 
that website could tell you things about that object .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA at point of purchase ,COMMA we might be able to make a compassionate choice .PERIOD 
there's a saying in the world of information science :COLON ultimately everybody will know everything .PERIOD 
and the question is :COLON will it make a difference ?QUESTIONMARK 
some time ago when i was working for the new york times ,COMMA it was in the '80s ,COMMA i did an article on what was then a new problem in new york -- it was homeless people on the streets .PERIOD 
we don't notice and therefore we don't act .PERIOD 
and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man slumped to the side ,COMMA shirtless ,COMMA not moving ,COMMA and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people .PERIOD 
and because my urban trance had been somehow weakened ,COMMA i found myself stopping to find out what was wrong .PERIOD 
the moment i stopped ,COMMA half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy .PERIOD 
and we found out that he was hispanic ,COMMA he didn't speak any english ,COMMA he had no money ,COMMA he'd been wandering the streets for days ,COMMA starving ,COMMA and he'd fainted from hunger .PERIOD 
immediately someone went to get orange juice ,COMMA someone brought a hotdog ,COMMA someone brought a subway cop .PERIOD 
this guy was back on his feet immediately .PERIOD 
but all it took was that simple act of noticing ,COMMA and so i'm optimistic .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON welcome to ted .PERIOD 
richard branson :COLON thank you very much .PERIOD the first ted has been great .PERIOD 
have you met anyone interesting ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the nice thing about ted is everybody's interesting .PERIOD 
i was very glad to see goldie hawn ,COMMA because i had an apology to make to her .PERIOD 
i'd had dinner with her about two years ago and i'd -- she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my finger and i couldn't get it off .PERIOD 
and i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman's big ,COMMA massive ,COMMA big wedding ring on my finger .PERIOD 
so -- -- so apologies to goldie .PERIOD 
that's pretty good .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here .PERIOD 
you've started one or two in your time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA virgin atlantic ,COMMA virgin records -- i guess it all started with a magazine called student .PERIOD 
i read all these sort of ted instructions :COLON you must not talk about your own business ,COMMA and this ,COMMA and now you ask me .PERIOD 
it depends what the answer is though .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i think i learned early on that if you can run one company ,COMMA you can really run any companies .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA companies are all about finding the right people ,COMMA inspiring those people ,COMMA you know ,COMMA drawing out the best in people .PERIOD 
and i just love learning and i'm incredibly inquisitive and i love taking on ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the status quo and trying to turn it upside down .PERIOD 
so i've seen life as one long learning process .PERIOD 
and if i see -- you know ,COMMA if i fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one ,COMMA which it wasn't ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA then i'd think ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA maybe i can create the kind of airline that i'd like to fly on .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so got one secondhand <NUM> from boeing and gave it a go .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA that was a bizarre thing ,COMMA because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA it almost took down your empire at one point .PERIOD 
i had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who ,COMMA at the time when you basically sold virgin records and invested heavily in virgin atlantic ,COMMA and his view was that you were trading ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the world's fourth biggest record company for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind .PERIOD 
why did you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure .PERIOD 
and i think if you start a business without financial backing ,COMMA you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line .PERIOD 
we had -- we were being attacked by british airways .PERIOD 
they were trying to put our airline out of business ,COMMA and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign .PERIOD 
and i realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless i chipped in a chip .PERIOD 
and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline ,COMMA and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company ,COMMA i had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline .PERIOD 
post-napster ,COMMA you're looking like a bit of a genius ,COMMA actually ,COMMA for that as well .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA as it turned out ,COMMA it proved to be the right move .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it was sad at the time ,COMMA but we moved on .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you use the virgin brand a lot and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other .PERIOD 
what does the brand stand for in your head ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i like to think it stands for quality ,COMMA that you know ,COMMA if somebody comes across a virgin company ,COMMA they -- ca :COLON they are quality ,COMMA richard .PERIOD come on now ,COMMA everyone says quality .PERIOD spirit ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA but i was going to move on this .PERIOD 
we have a lot of fun and i think the people who work for it enjoy it .PERIOD 
as i say ,COMMA we go in and shake up other industries ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we do it differently and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA virgin brides -- what happened there ?QUESTIONMARK 
we couldn't find any customers .PERIOD 
i was actually also curious why -- i think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch .PERIOD you called it mates .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA couldn't you have used the virgin brand for that as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
ain't virgin no longer ,COMMA or something .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA we may have had problems finding customers .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we had -- often ,COMMA when you launch a company and you get customer complaints ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can deal with them .PERIOD 
but about three months after the launch of the condom company ,COMMA i had a letter ,COMMA a complaint ,COMMA and i sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely .PERIOD 
but obviously ,COMMA there wasn't a lot i could do about it .PERIOD 
and then six months later ,COMMA or nine months after the problem had taken ,COMMA i got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if i'd be godfather ,COMMA which i became .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it all worked out well .PERIOD 
really ?QUESTIONMARK you should have brought a picture .PERIOD that's wonderful .PERIOD 
i should have .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA what are the numbers on this ?QUESTIONMARK 
how much -- what's the total revenue ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's about <NUM> billion dollars now ,COMMA in total .PERIOD 
and how many employees ?QUESTIONMARK 
about <NUM> .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that .PERIOD 
what was that ?QUESTIONMARK was that real ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD we were launching a megastore in los angeles ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD 
what was that one ?QUESTIONMARK 
dropping in for tea .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA that was quite fun .PERIOD that was a wonderful car-boat in which -- ca :COLON oh ,COMMA that car that we -- actually we -- it was a tedster event there ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
is that -- could you still pause on that one actually ,COMMA for a minute ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's a tough job ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA it is a tough job .PERIOD 
when i first came to america ,COMMA i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here ,COMMA it's very strange .PERIOD 
i know ,COMMA i have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that ,COMMA but -- ca :COLON i mean ,COMMA speaking of which ,COMMA tell us about -- rb :COLON pammy we launched ,COMMA you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on coca-cola ,COMMA and we launched a cola bottle called the pammy and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson .PERIOD 
but the trouble is ,COMMA it kept on tipping over ,COMMA but -- ca :COLON designed by philippe starck perhaps ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA we'll just run a couple more pictures here .PERIOD virgin brides .PERIOD very nice .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA ok ,COMMA so stop there .PERIOD this was -- you had some award i think ?QUESTIONMARK 
but somehow ,COMMA she must have had a forgetful memory ,COMMA i think .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA god saved her and you got your just reward .PERIOD 
do you like to be called sir richard ,COMMA or how ?QUESTIONMARK 
nobody's ever called me sir richard .PERIOD 
occasionally in america ,COMMA i hear people saying sir richard and think there's some shakespearean play taking place .PERIOD 
but nowhere else anyway .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD so can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just . .PERIOD 
no .PERIOD i suppose if you're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something ,COMMA that might be worth using it .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's not richard branson .PERIOD it's sir richard branson .PERIOD 
i'll go get the secretary to use it .PERIOD 
ok .PERIOD so let's look at the space thing .PERIOD 
i think ,COMMA with us ,COMMA we've got a video that shows what you're up to ,COMMA and virgin galactic up in the air .PERIOD 
so that's the bert rutan designed spaceship ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah ,COMMA it'll be ready in -- well ,COMMA ready in <NUM> months and then we do <NUM> months extensive testing .PERIOD 
and then <NUM> months from now ,COMMA people will be able to take a ride into space .PERIOD 
so this interior is philippe starcke designed ?QUESTIONMARK 
philippe has done the -- yeah ,COMMA quite a bit of it :COLON the logos and he's building the space station in new mexico .PERIOD 
and basically ,COMMA he's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye ,COMMA so when you're in space ,COMMA you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you .PERIOD 
and when you land ,COMMA you'll be able to go back into this giant eye .PERIOD 
but he's an absolute genius when it comes to design .PERIOD 
but you didn't have him design the engine ?QUESTIONMARK 
philippe is quite erratic ,COMMA so i think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
he gave a wonderful talk here two days ago .PERIOD 
yeah ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA he is a -- ca :COLON well ,COMMA some people found it wonderful ,COMMA some people found it completely bizarre .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i personally found it wonderful .PERIOD 
he's a wonderful enthusiast ,COMMA which is why i love him .PERIOD but . .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA now ,COMMA you've always had this exploration bug in you .PERIOD 
have you ever regretted that ?QUESTIONMARK 
many times .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past .PERIOD 
so in those moments ,COMMA you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or -- ca :COLON what was the closest you got to -- when did you think ,COMMA this is it ,COMMA i might be on my way out ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think the balloon adventures were -- each one was ,COMMA each one ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i think we came close .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before ,COMMA so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream ,COMMA and we weren't quite sure ,COMMA when a balloon actually got into the jet stream ,COMMA whether it would actually survive the <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> miles an hour winds that you can find up there .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA just the initial lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic ,COMMA as we were pushing into the jet stream ,COMMA this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour ,COMMA the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour ,COMMA and it just took off .PERIOD 
and it was like holding onto a thousand horses .PERIOD 
and we were just crossing every finger ,COMMA praying that the balloon would hold together ,COMMA which ,COMMA fortunately ,COMMA it did .PERIOD 
did he tell you to jump ,COMMA or he just said ,COMMA i'm out of here !EXCLAMATIONMARK and . .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA he told me jump ,COMMA but once his weight had gone ,COMMA the balloon just shot up to <NUM> feet and i . .PERIOD 
and you inspired an ian mcewan novel i think with that .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA we managed to survive it .PERIOD 
did you jump ?QUESTIONMARK or it came down in the end ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i knew i had about half an hour's fuel left ,COMMA and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped ,COMMA i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .PERIOD 
so i climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that i was making the right decision .PERIOD 
and wrote some notes to my family .PERIOD and then climbed back up again ,COMMA looked down at those clouds again ,COMMA climbed back into the capsule again .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA just thought ,COMMA there's a better way .PERIOD 
i've got ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this enormous balloon above me ,COMMA it's the biggest parachute ever ,COMMA why not use it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds ,COMMA and about <NUM> feet ,COMMA before i hit the sea ,COMMA threw myself over .PERIOD 
and the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to <NUM> feet without me .PERIOD 
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- ca :COLON what did you write to your family ?QUESTIONMARK 
just what you would do in a situation like that :COLON just i love you very much .PERIOD and i'd already written them a letter before going on this trip ,COMMA which -- just in case anything had happened .PERIOD 
but fortunately ,COMMA they never had to use it .PERIOD 
your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics .PERIOD 
and cynics might say ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing .PERIOD 
how much was the pr value part of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the pr experts said that as an airline owner ,COMMA the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats ,COMMA and crashing into the seas .PERIOD 
they have a point ,COMMA richard .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying ,COMMA you know ,COMMA come on ,COMMA richard ,COMMA there are better ways of crossing the atlantic .PERIOD 
to do all this ,COMMA you must have been a genius from the get-go ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i won't contradict that .PERIOD 
i was dyslexic .PERIOD i had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever .PERIOD 
i certainly would have failed iq tests .PERIOD 
and it was one of the reasons i left school when i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
and if i -- if i'm not interested in something ,COMMA i don't grasp it .PERIOD 
as somebody who's dyslexic ,COMMA you also have some quite bizarre situations .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA i've had to -- you know ,COMMA i've been running the largest group of private companies in europe ,COMMA but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross .PERIOD 
and so the board meetings have been fascinating .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA good news or bad news ?QUESTIONMARK 
but just to clarify ,COMMA the <NUM> billion dollars is gross ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK that's gross ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i hope it's net actually ,COMMA having -- -- i've got it right .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA trust me ,COMMA it's gross .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when i turned <NUM> ,COMMA somebody took me outside the boardroom and said ,COMMA look richard ,COMMA here's a -- let me draw on a diagram .PERIOD 
here's a net in the sea ,COMMA and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .PERIOD 
and that's the profits you've got left over in this little net ,COMMA everything else is eaten .PERIOD 
and i finally worked it all out .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA at school -- so as well as being ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doing pretty miserably academically ,COMMA but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams .PERIOD 
so you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader ,COMMA but just a bit of a . .PERIOD were you a rebel then ,COMMA or how would you . .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i think i was a bit of a maverick and -- but i . .PERIOD and i was ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i was fortunately good at sport ,COMMA and so at least i had something to excel at ,COMMA at school .PERIOD 
and some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field ,COMMA aged four ,COMMA and saying ok ,COMMA walk home .PERIOD 
she was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age .PERIOD 
so she did things to us ,COMMA which now she'd be arrested for ,COMMA such as pushing us out of the car ,COMMA and telling us to find our own way to granny's ,COMMA about five miles before we actually got there .PERIOD 
and we were never allowed to watch television and the like .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy ,COMMA and they've got kids ,COMMA and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up .PERIOD 
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they're too coddled ,COMMA they don't know what they've got ,COMMA we're going to raise a generation of privileged . .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA i think if you're bringing up kids ,COMMA you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm .PERIOD 
so i don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really .PERIOD 
you didn't turn out too bad ,COMMA i have to say ,COMMA i'm . .PERIOD 
your headmaster said to you -- i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school -- he said ,COMMA you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison ,COMMA and i'm not sure which .PERIOD 
which of those happened first ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i've done both .PERIOD i think i went to prison first .PERIOD 
i was prosecuted under the <NUM> venereal diseases act and the <NUM> indecent advertisements act .PERIOD 
on the first occasion ,COMMA for mentioning the word venereal disease in public ,COMMA which -- we had a center where we would help young people who had problems .PERIOD 
and one of the problems young people have is venereal disease .PERIOD 
and there's an ancient law that says you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public .PERIOD 
so the police knocked on the door ,COMMA and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we put it back to vd and promptly got arrested .PERIOD 
and then subsequently ,COMMA never mind the bollocks ,COMMA here's the sex pistols ,COMMA the word bollocks ,COMMA the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols' album .PERIOD 
and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks .PERIOD 
and so i rang up nottingham university ,COMMA and i asked to talk to the professor of linguistics .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA look ,COMMA bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever .PERIOD 
it's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century .PERIOD 
and he went ,COMMA furthermore ,COMMA i'm a priest myself .PERIOD 
and so i said ,COMMA would you mind coming to the court ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said he'd be delighted .PERIOD and i said -- and he said ,COMMA would you like me to wear my dog collar ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA definitely .PERIOD please .PERIOD 
that's great .PERIOD 
so our key witness argued that it was actually never mind the priest ,COMMA here's the sex pistols .PERIOD 
and the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty ,COMMA so . .PERIOD 
that is outrageous .PERIOD 
a lot of people would say there's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doing some ugly things .PERIOD 
you've been accused of being ruthless .PERIOD 
is any of it true ?QUESTIONMARK is there an element of truth in it ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top ,COMMA generally speaking ,COMMA works .PERIOD 
i think if you treat people well ,COMMA people will come back and come back for more .PERIOD 
and i think all you have in life is your reputation and it's a very small world .PERIOD 
and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well ,COMMA and i like to think that's how we run virgin .PERIOD 
and what about the people who love you and who see you spending -- you keep getting caught up in these new projects ,COMMA but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff .PERIOD 
you get excited by an idea and ,COMMA kapow !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
how do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ?QUESTIONMARK 
i also believe that being a father's incredibly important ,COMMA so from the time the kids were very young ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when they go on holiday ,COMMA i go on holiday with them .PERIOD 
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA i'll ,COMMA you know ,COMMA be in touch .PERIOD we're very lucky ,COMMA we have this tiny little island in the caribbean and we can -- so i can take them there and we can bring friends ,COMMA and we can play together ,COMMA but i can also keep in touch with what's going on .PERIOD 
you started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy .PERIOD 
what is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
capitalism has been proven to be a system that works .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA the alternative ,COMMA communism ,COMMA has not worked .PERIOD 
and i think it's important that the individuals ,COMMA who are in that fortunate position ,COMMA do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats ,COMMA and bigger and bigger cars ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world .PERIOD 
and what are the issues that you worry about most ,COMMA care most about ,COMMA want to turn your resources toward ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA there's -- i mean there's a lot of issues .PERIOD 
i mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into ,COMMA a ,COMMA trying to come up with alternative fuels and ,COMMA b ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we just launched this prize ,COMMA which is really a prize in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels ,COMMA in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly ,COMMA and in case we go through the tipping point .PERIOD 
we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the earth's atmosphere .PERIOD 
and we just -- you know ,COMMA there weren't really people working on that before ,COMMA so we wanted people to try to -- all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that ,COMMA and also to try to extract the methane out of the earth's atmosphere as well .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA we've had about <NUM> people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go .PERIOD 
and so we only need one ,COMMA so we're hopeful .PERIOD 
and you're also working in africa on a couple of projects ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA we've got -- we're setting up something called the war room ,COMMA which is maybe the wrong word .PERIOD 
we're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway ,COMMA it's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in africa ,COMMA all the different social problems in africa ,COMMA and try to look at best practices .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA there's a doctor in africa that's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at <NUM> weeks ,COMMA when she's pregnant ,COMMA that the baby will not have hiv when it's born .PERIOD 
and so disseminating that information to around the rest of africa is important .PERIOD 
the war room sounds ,COMMA it sounds powerful and dramatic .PERIOD 
is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say ,COMMA we've got to fix this problem and we can do it ,COMMA i've got all these billions of dollars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA da ,COMMA da ,COMMA da -- here's the big idea .PERIOD and kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it .PERIOD do you worry about that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA on this particular situation ,COMMA we're actually -- we're working with the government on it .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA thabo mbeki's had his problems with accepting hiv and aids are related ,COMMA but this is a way ,COMMA i think ,COMMA of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him ,COMMA it's a way of working with him ,COMMA with his government .PERIOD 
it's important that if people do go to africa and do try to help ,COMMA they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years .PERIOD 
it's got to be consistent .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA we're setting up clinics in africa where we're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs ,COMMA free tb treatment and free malaria treatment .PERIOD 
but we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics ,COMMA so that people pay for some other aspects .PERIOD 
i mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself ,COMMA or bill gates ,COMMA or whatever ,COMMA that this is really being -- it's almost driven by some sort of desire again ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for the right image ,COMMA for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct .PERIOD 
what would you say to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i think that everybody -- people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and i think that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when i'm on me deathbed ,COMMA i will want to feel that i've made a difference to other people's lives .PERIOD 
and that may be a selfish thing to think ,COMMA but it's the way i've been brought up .PERIOD 
i think if i'm in a position to radically change other people's lives for the better ,COMMA i should do so .PERIOD 
how old are you ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm <NUM> .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA the psychologist erik erikson says that -- as i understand him and i'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s ,COMMA 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment .PERIOD 
50s ,COMMA 60s ,COMMA the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it seems like you're still a little bit in the growth phases ,COMMA you're still doing these incredible new plans .PERIOD 
how much do you think about legacy ,COMMA and what would you like your legacy to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't think i think too much about legacy .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i like to -- you know ,COMMA my grandmother lived to <NUM> ,COMMA so hopefully i've got another <NUM> or <NUM> years to go .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA i just want to live life to its full .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if i can make a difference ,COMMA i hope to be able to make a difference .PERIOD 
and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you've got sergey and larry from google ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA who are good friends .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA thank god ,COMMA you've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth .PERIOD 
if they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world ,COMMA it would be very worrying .PERIOD 
and you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world .PERIOD 
and i think it's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference .PERIOD 
and you actually did inspire me .PERIOD i looked at you ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA he's made it .PERIOD maybe there is a different way .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
the moment i say school ,COMMA so many memories come back to me .PERIOD 
it's like after every exam ,COMMA when i walk out ,COMMA the teacher would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA come .PERIOD 
how did you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i didn't understand why ,COMMA in one hand they say ,COMMA speak the truth ,COMMA in the other hand ,COMMA when you say the truth ,COMMA they hated you .PERIOD 
so it went on like that ,COMMA and i didn't know where else to find myself .PERIOD 
so i remember those nights i used to go to sleep with asking help from [the] unknown because ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA i couldn't believe what my father and mother hanged in the puja room as a god ,COMMA because my friend's family had something else as a god .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA i guess i'll pray to [the] unknown and ask help ,COMMA and started getting help from everywhere ,COMMA each and every corner of my life at that time .PERIOD 
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA when i was in eighth standard around <NUM> years old ,COMMA i started working in a part-time job in one of the signboard artists called putu .PERIOD 
and then school also started supporting me .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA he's bad at studies ,COMMA but let him send to the drawing competitions .PERIOD 
so it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school .PERIOD 
and one of those competitions ,COMMA i just won a small ,COMMA little transistor philips radio .PERIOD 
and i didn't have the patience to wait until i reached home .PERIOD 
so i just switched on in the train ,COMMA loudly .PERIOD 
if you travel in indian trains ,COMMA you can see people listening to radio and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA even from their mobiles .PERIOD 
so at that time -- and i was <NUM> -- and i was listening to just radio ,COMMA and someone happened to sit next to me ,COMMA like these three people are sitting here .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA like just adjacent to me .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA it's a prize from [an] art competition .PERIOD 
i think you should study in a school of art .PERIOD 
you just quit school and come there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA why i'm telling you this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA you know ,COMMA whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible .PERIOD 
it is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned .PERIOD 
so that's what made me enter [the] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what i really want to do with art work ,COMMA or art and finally i'm here in front of you .PERIOD 
when i look back ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on what happened between that time and now here -- the last <NUM>/<NUM> years -- i can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects ,COMMA but it was not intentional .PERIOD 
and i just start out with a trace because i was thinking ,COMMA what really makes us ?QUESTIONMARK -- you know ,COMMA it's actually [the] past ,COMMA what makes a person .PERIOD 
so i was thinking ,COMMA but when you look at the past ,COMMA the way to understand the past is only by the traces available ,COMMA because we cannot go back [to] the past .PERIOD 
and that fascinated me ,COMMA to explore that territory .PERIOD 
so i was working on the line ,COMMA but instead of working about traces ,COMMA i started capturing traces .PERIOD 
so here are some of the works i would like to show you .PERIOD 
so this is called self in progress .PERIOD 
it's just a trace of being in this body .PERIOD 
so here ,COMMA what happened then ,COMMA you know -- what i really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself .PERIOD 
it's almost like a 3d photograph .PERIOD 
so there is an element of performance ,COMMA and there is an element of sculpture ,COMMA and there is an element of feeling one's self ,COMMA so close to one's self .PERIOD 
so it's almost like fossils for the future .PERIOD 
and then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces .PERIOD 
so this is what i was talking about ,COMMA while molding ,COMMA it's such a great experience ,COMMA because we have freedom of like walking ,COMMA or moving my hand or ,COMMA moving around in the space ,COMMA but the moment this becomes solid ,COMMA when you cannot move even an inch ,COMMA because this is plaster of paris ,COMMA so the moment you pour it it's like liquid ;SEMICOLON but after <NUM> minutes ,COMMA it's almost like a hard stone .PERIOD 
so this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because ,COMMA knowingly or unknowingly ,COMMA whatever we do ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we leave our traces here .PERIOD 
so i just thought ,COMMA i'm going to capture thumbprint ,COMMA footprint ,COMMA or whatever traces we leave as humans .PERIOD 
this is the trace of fire ,COMMA this is the trace of sun .PERIOD 
because when i was capturing traces ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this thought comes to me always :COLON is it ,COMMA only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace ,COMMA or is there other ways to capture it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens ,COMMA it just shows what is on the other side .PERIOD 
so i just put the paper on the focal length ,COMMA which was an etching print ,COMMA then i got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight .PERIOD 
this is called dawn to dawn .PERIOD 
what i did here ,COMMA i just put like <NUM> feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope ,COMMA and just burnt it .PERIOD 
so wherever the fire is eating the paper ,COMMA that's what becomes the work -- detail .PERIOD 
even though we have traces when we try to understand them ,COMMA the perception and context play a major role to understand it .PERIOD 
so do we really understand what it is ,COMMA or are we trying to get what we think it is ?QUESTIONMARK 
then move towards questioning the perception because ,COMMA even though there are traces ,COMMA when you try to understand them ,COMMA you know you play a major role .PERIOD 
so like let's say even a simple act .PERIOD 
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from bangalore to mysore ?QUESTIONMARK 
can you just raise the hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you just ask an opinion of how ,COMMA everyone can interpret it .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA if a schoolteacher says ,COMMA she'll simply say ,COMMA to get to the other side .PERIOD 
why the cow was crossing the road ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
the answer can be so different if potter said it .PERIOD 
he would say ,COMMA for the greater good .PERIOD 
martin luther king would say ,COMMA i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road ,COMMA without having their motives called into question .PERIOD 
imagine moses comes now ,COMMA and he sees the same cow walking around the street .PERIOD 
he would definitely say ,COMMA god came down from heaven ,COMMA and he said unto the cow ,COMMA 'thou shalt cross the road' and cow crossed the road ,COMMA and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow .PERIOD 
freud would say ,COMMA the fact that you're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity .PERIOD 
if we ask einstein ,COMMA he would say ,COMMA whether the cow crossed the road ,COMMA or the road moved underneath the cow ,COMMA depends on your frame of reference .PERIOD 
or buddha -- if he saw the same cow ,COMMA he would say ,COMMA asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow .PERIOD 
it just all depends on one's perception .PERIOD 
and context ,COMMA what is really context ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA i could just show you this little piece of paper .PERIOD 
because i always think meaning doesn't really exist .PERIOD 
the meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist .PERIOD 
it's just created by the mind .PERIOD 
if you look at this piece of paper ,COMMA this is the breadth and this is called length .PERIOD 
this is how we've been taught in school .PERIOD 
but if you tear it in the middle -- now ,COMMA i didn't touch this breadth ,COMMA but still ,COMMA the meaning of this changes .PERIOD 
so what we conceive as a meaning is always not there ;SEMICOLON it's on the other side ,COMMA even when we say dark ,COMMA light ,COMMA good ,COMMA bad ,COMMA tall ,COMMA short -- all meaning it doesn't exist in reality .PERIOD 
it's just that being a human ,COMMA the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning .PERIOD 
it's just captured through from the lamp .PERIOD 
so the lamp is not just giving a light ,COMMA it's also giving a darkness .PERIOD 
so this is a work of art ,COMMA which is just trying to explore that .PERIOD 
this is called limit out .PERIOD 
this shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's about six inches deep in the wall ,COMMA but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall .PERIOD 
you know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin ,COMMA and this is the second ,COMMA and there's a third ,COMMA and each creates a meaning .PERIOD 
and we're just pulling the wall off the gallery .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA inward out .PERIOD 
it's a full-figure cast from myself .PERIOD 
it's about eight inches deep .PERIOD 
when i was doing that ,COMMA i always wondered since i've worked with creators -- and now you know ,COMMA i've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever i see the bird flying in the sky ,COMMA it just makes me feel like :COLON is there anything behind ,COMMA are there any traces up there ,COMMA which as a human ,COMMA we don't see them ?QUESTIONMARK 
is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ?QUESTIONMARK 
i couldn't find it .PERIOD 
it's called odonil .PERIOD 
the process to get to make the sculpture was interesting ,COMMA because i wrote to balsara ,COMMA who produces that air freshener called odonil ,COMMA saying ,COMMA dear sir ,COMMA i am an artist .PERIOD this is my catalogue .PERIOD 
will you help me to make this sculpture ?QUESTIONMARK 
they never wrote back to me .PERIOD 
then i thought ,COMMA i will go to the small scale industries facilitating unit and ask help .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
this is the fee for the project report ,COMMA and we will give you all the details ,COMMA and they gave .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA i went back to them and said ,COMMA it's not for starting the company ,COMMA it's just to make my own work .PERIOD 
please come for the show .PERIOD 
and they did .PERIOD 
and this work is in the devi art foundation in delhi .PERIOD 
in india ,COMMA nobody really talks about works of art ;SEMICOLON they always talk about the appreciation of art .PERIOD 
you buy this for <NUM> rupees ,COMMA it'll become <NUM> in two months .PERIOD 
this is the craft that was going on ,COMMA but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .PERIOD 
and this was collected by anapum -- which is like ,COMMA finally in the end ,COMMA he will not have anything ,COMMA because it will evaporate .PERIOD 
so this is after a few weeks ,COMMA this is after a few months .PERIOD 
it's just all about questioning the preconceptions .PERIOD 
so if someone says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i see the portrait ,COMMA it may not be the portrait after a few months .PERIOD 
and if they say it's solid ,COMMA it will not be solid ,COMMA it will evaporate .PERIOD 
and if they say they don't get it ,COMMA that's also not true ,COMMA because it's in the air .PERIOD 
it's in the same gallery or in the same museum .PERIOD 
so they inhaled it ,COMMA but they are not aware of it .PERIOD 
while i was doing that work ,COMMA my mom and my dad ,COMMA they were looking at it and they said ,COMMA why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i was like ,COMMA what do you mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
light makes dark and now evaporating self .PERIOD 
don't you think it remained something about death ,COMMA they said .PERIOD 
of course not .PERIOD for me ,COMMA i'm thinking ,COMMA this is tucked in some small solid ,COMMA but the moment it evaporates ,COMMA it's merged with the whole .PERIOD 
but she said ,COMMA no .PERIOD still ,COMMA i don't like it .PERIOD 
can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA no ,COMMA mom .PERIOD it can't be .PERIOD 
because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together ,COMMA or we can break the sculpture and get the dust ,COMMA but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i did this work for her .PERIOD 
it's called emerging angel .PERIOD 
this is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the same sculpture after a few days .PERIOD 
this is after <NUM>/<NUM> days .PERIOD 
through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood ,COMMA the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one .PERIOD 
this gave me a greater faith .PERIOD 
that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible .PERIOD 
so what you see now is called shadow foreshadow .PERIOD 
and what i'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow ,COMMA and we don't see light too ;SEMICOLON we see the source of the light .PERIOD 
we see where it's bouncing ,COMMA but we don't see [them] as they exist .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA that's why the night sky ,COMMA we see the sky as dark ,COMMA but it's filled with light all the time .PERIOD 
when it's bounced on the moon ,COMMA we see it .PERIOD 
the same thing in the darkroom .PERIOD 
the little dust particle will again ,COMMA reflect the light ,COMMA and we realize the existence of light .PERIOD 
so we don't see dark ,COMMA we don't see light ,COMMA we don't see gravity ,COMMA we don't see electricity .PERIOD 
if we sculpt this ,COMMA this has two reference points .PERIOD 
the skin of this is also representing this .PERIOD 
and skin at the other end also represents the floor .PERIOD 
i did this as an experiment of casting the shadow .PERIOD 
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow .PERIOD 
then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence .PERIOD 
so that produced a shadow .PERIOD 
then i thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let me sculpt that .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA again ,COMMA that becomes an object .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA throwing light ,COMMA then the third one .PERIOD 
so what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow .PERIOD 
and then again ,COMMA at that point ,COMMA there is no shadow .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA good .PERIOD work is finished .PERIOD 
you can see the detail .PERIOD 
this is called gravity .PERIOD 
it's called breath .PERIOD it's just two holes on the gallery wall .PERIOD 
it's a false wall ,COMMA which contains like <NUM> cubic feet .PERIOD 
so that hole actually makes the air come out and go in .PERIOD 
so where it's happening ,COMMA we can see ,COMMA but what is happening will remain invisible only .PERIOD 
this is from the show called invisible ,COMMA at talwar gallery .PERIOD 
this is called kaayam .PERIOD 
detail .PERIOD 
and what i'd like to tell you ,COMMA our senses are so limited -- we cannot hear everything ,COMMA we cannot see everything .PERIOD 
we don't feel ,COMMA i am touching the air ,COMMA but if the breeze is a little more faster ,COMMA then i can feel it .PERIOD 
so all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses .PERIOD 
so my recourse was like ,COMMA is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign ?QUESTIONMARK 
and to really get to the point ,COMMA we should move beyond ,COMMA you know ,COMMA go to the other side of the wall ,COMMA like in logic ,COMMA like are invisible .PERIOD 
because when we see someone walks ,COMMA we see the footprint .PERIOD 
but if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it ,COMMA you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints ,COMMA and the footprints are nothing but passing time .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
the decorative use of wire in southern africa dates back hundreds of years .PERIOD 
but modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material ,COMMA in the form of telephone wire .PERIOD 
rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials .PERIOD 
these pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s .PERIOD 
in the '90s ,COMMA my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form ,COMMA which came from a squatter camp outside durban .PERIOD 
and i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point ,COMMA and started developing ,COMMA really ,COMMA and mentoring them in terms of scale ,COMMA in terms of the design .PERIOD 
and the project soon grew from five to <NUM> weavers in about a year .PERIOD 
soon we had outgrown the scrap yards ,COMMA what they could provide ,COMMA so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us ,COMMA and not only to supply the materials on bobbins ,COMMA but to produce to our color specifications .PERIOD 
at the same time ,COMMA i was thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products ,COMMA away from the ethnic ,COMMA a little bit more contemporary .PERIOD 
so i developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .PERIOD 
we started experimenting ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA in terms of shapes ,COMMA forms .PERIOD the scale became very important ,COMMA and it's become our pet project .PERIOD it's successful ,COMMA it's been running for <NUM> years .PERIOD and we supply the conran shops ,COMMA and donna karan ,COMMA and so it's kind of great .PERIOD 
this is our group ,COMMA our main group of weavers .PERIOD 
they come on a weekly basis to durban .PERIOD 
they all have bank accounts .PERIOD 
they've all moved back to the rural area where they came from .PERIOD 
it's a weekly turnaround of production .PERIOD 
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .PERIOD 
and that's also modernized today ,COMMA and it's supporting work for <NUM> weavers .PERIOD 
and the rest says it all .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so i work in marketing ,COMMA which i love ,COMMA but my first passion was physics ,COMMA a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher ,COMMA when i had a little less gray hair .PERIOD 
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .PERIOD 
and i'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing .PERIOD 
so quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university ?QUESTIONMARK 
who studied some physics in university ?QUESTIONMARK 
pretty good .PERIOD and at school ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA lots of you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA hopefully this will bring back some happy ,COMMA or possibly some slightly disturbing memories .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA physics and marketing .PERIOD 
we'll start with something very simple -- newton's law :COLON the force equals mass times acceleration .PERIOD 
this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .PERIOD 
but if we rearrange this formula quickly ,COMMA we can get to acceleration equals force over mass ,COMMA which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .PERIOD 
it's the same with brands :COLON the more massive a brand ,COMMA the more baggage it has ,COMMA the more force is needed to change its positioning .PERIOD 
and that's one of the reasons why arthur andersen chose to launch accenture rather than try to persuade the world that andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy .PERIOD 
it explains why hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners ,COMMA and why companies like unilever and p&ampg keep brands separate ,COMMA like ariel and pringles and dove rather than having one giant parent brand .PERIOD 
so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction .PERIOD 
the marketing is ,COMMA the bigger a brand ,COMMA the more difficult it is to reposition it .PERIOD 
so think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA who remembers heisenberg's uncertainty principle ?QUESTIONMARK 
getting a little more technical now .PERIOD 
so this says that it's impossible ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA to measure exactly the state -- ie ,COMMA the position -- and the momentum of a particle ,COMMA because the act of measuring it ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA changes it .PERIOD 
so to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it ,COMMA then the photon of light has momentum ,COMMA which knocks the particle ,COMMA so you don't know where it was before you looked at it .PERIOD 
by measuring it ,COMMA the act of measurement changes it .PERIOD 
the act of observation changes it .PERIOD 
so with the act of observing consumers ,COMMA changes their behavior .PERIOD 
think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group ,COMMA and almost none of them buy lots of junk food .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA mcdonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year .PERIOD 
think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets ,COMMA who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit ,COMMA but don't shop like that any other day .PERIOD 
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the web ,COMMA it's very few .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA at google ,COMMA we know it's the number-one searched for category .PERIOD 
so luckily ,COMMA the science -- no ,COMMA sorry -- the marketing is getting easier .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA with now better point-of-sale tracking ,COMMA more digital media consumption ,COMMA you can measure more what consumers actually do ,COMMA rather than what they say they do .PERIOD 
so the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle ,COMMA because the observation changes it .PERIOD 
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do ,COMMA rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do .PERIOD 
so next ,COMMA the scientific method -- an axiom of physics ,COMMA of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation ,COMMA you can only disprove it .PERIOD 
what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning ,COMMA and it will strengthen it ,COMMA but it will not conclusively prove it .PERIOD 
and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .PERIOD 
so if we take an example -- ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth .PERIOD 
and there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand ,COMMA but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief .PERIOD 
think about toyota .PERIOD 
it was ,COMMA for a long time ,COMMA revered as the most reliable of cars ,COMMA and then they had the big recall incident .PERIOD 
and tiger woods ,COMMA for a long time ,COMMA the perfect brand ambassador .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you know the story .PERIOD 
so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis ,COMMA but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky .PERIOD 
and the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand ,COMMA one bad week can undermine decades of good work .PERIOD 
so be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand .PERIOD 
and lastly ,COMMA to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics .PERIOD 
this says that entropy ,COMMA which is a measure of the disorder of a system ,COMMA will always increase .PERIOD 
if we go back <NUM> years ,COMMA the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .PERIOD 
but where we are today ,COMMA things have changed .PERIOD 
you can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their election poster .PERIOD 
but then you lose control of it .PERIOD 
with the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer ,COMMA it's impossible to control where it goes .PERIOD 
your brand starts being dispersed ,COMMA it gets more chaotic .PERIOD 
it's out of your control .PERIOD 
i actually saw him speak -- he did a good job .PERIOD 
but while this may be unsettling for marketers ,COMMA it's actually a good thing .PERIOD 
this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people ,COMMA more in with the people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ;SEMICOLON it's a fundamental law .PERIOD 
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .PERIOD 
you can't fight it ,COMMA so embrace it and find a way to work with it .PERIOD 
so to close ,COMMA my teacher ,COMMA mr .PERIOD vutter ,COMMA told me that physics is cool ,COMMA and hopefully ,COMMA i've convinced you that physics can teach all of us ,COMMA even in the world of marketing ,COMMA something special .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA since this is tedglobal ,COMMA who can tell me what this is called in french ?QUESTIONMARK 
and in spanish ,COMMA zanfona .PERIOD 
and in italian ,COMMA ghironda ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK

so ,COMMA these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .PERIOD 
the hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings ,COMMA like the bow of a violin ,COMMA to produce music .PERIOD 
it has three different kinds of strings .PERIOD 
the first string is the drone string ,COMMA which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe .PERIOD 
the second string is a melody string ,COMMA which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano .PERIOD 
and the third string is pretty innovative .PERIOD 
it activates what's called the buzzing bridge ,COMMA or the dog .PERIOD 
when i turn the crank and i apply pressure ,COMMA it makes a sound like a barking dog .PERIOD 
so all of this is pretty innovative ,COMMA if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it ;SEMICOLON one to turn the crank ,COMMA and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA all of this changed a couple of centuries later .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy-gurdy .PERIOD 
the hurdy-gurdy has been used ,COMMA historically ,COMMA through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here .PERIOD 
and this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it] .PERIOD 
it's made by specialized luthiers ,COMMA also in europe .PERIOD 
and it's very difficult to tune .PERIOD 
so without further ado ,COMMA would you like to hear it ?QUESTIONMARK 
caroline phillips :COLON i didn't hear you .PERIOD would you like to hear it ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay .PERIOD 
there i go .PERIOD 
i'd like to sing in basque ,COMMA which is the language spoken in the basque country where i live ,COMMA in the region in france and spain .PERIOD 
[basque] thank you .PERIOD 
this is a song that i wrote based on traditional basque rhythms .PERIOD 
and this is a song that has a kind of a celtic feel .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century ,COMMA and perhaps in the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
but i want to start with my work on romantic love ,COMMA because that's my most recent work .PERIOD 
what i and my colleagues did was put <NUM> people ,COMMA who were madly in love ,COMMA into a functional mri brain scanner .PERIOD 
<NUM> who were madly in love and their love was accepted ;SEMICOLON and <NUM> who were madly in love and they had just been dumped .PERIOD 
and so i want to tell you about that first ,COMMA and then go on into where i think love is going .PERIOD 
what 'tis to love ?QUESTIONMARK shakespeare said .PERIOD 
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .PERIOD 
i started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last <NUM> years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out ,COMMA there's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love .PERIOD 
the first thing that happens is what i call -- a person begins to take on what i call ,COMMA special meaning .PERIOD 
as a truck driver once said to me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA the world had a new center ,COMMA and that center was mary anne .PERIOD 
george bernard shaw said it a little differently .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA that's what we do .PERIOD 
and then you just focus on this person .PERIOD 
you can list what you don't like about them ,COMMA but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do .PERIOD 
as chaucer said ,COMMA love is blind .PERIOD 
in trying to understand romantic love ,COMMA i decided i would read poetry from all over the world ,COMMA and i just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century china ,COMMA because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman .PERIOD 
it's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot .PERIOD 
their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party .PERIOD 
and in this case ,COMMA a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat .PERIOD 
and it goes like this .PERIOD it's by a guy called yuan chen :COLON i cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat .PERIOD 
the night i brought you home ,COMMA i watched you roll it out .PERIOD 
he became hooked on a sleeping mat ,COMMA probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain ,COMMA just like with you and me .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA not only does this person take on special meaning ,COMMA you focus your attention on them .PERIOD 
you aggrandize them .PERIOD but you have intense energy .PERIOD 
as one polynesian said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA i felt like jumping in the sky .PERIOD 
you're up all night .PERIOD you're walking till dawn .PERIOD 
you feel intense elation when things are going well ;SEMICOLON mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly .PERIOD 
real dependence on this person .PERIOD 
as one businessman in new york said to me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA anything she liked ,COMMA i liked .PERIOD 
simple .PERIOD romantic love is very simple .PERIOD 
you become extremely sexually possessive .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if you're just sleeping with somebody casually ,COMMA you don't really care if they're sleeping with somebody else .PERIOD 
i think that that is a darwinian -- there's a darwinian purpose to this .PERIOD 
the whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team .PERIOD 
you'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them ,COMMA but you want them to call you on the telephone ,COMMA to invite you out ,COMMA etc ,COMMA to tell you that they love you .PERIOD 
the other main characteristic is motivation .PERIOD 
the motor in your brain begins to crank ,COMMA and you want this person .PERIOD 
and last but not least ,COMMA it is an obsession .PERIOD 
when i put these people in the machine ,COMMA before i put them in the mri machine ,COMMA i would ask them all kinds of questions .PERIOD 
but my most important question was always the same .PERIOD 
it was :COLON what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ?QUESTIONMARK 
and indeed ,COMMA they would say ,COMMA all day .PERIOD all night .PERIOD i can never stop thinking about him or her .PERIOD 
i don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .PERIOD 
and my final question was always the same .PERIOD 
i would say ,COMMA would you die for him or her ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA these people would say yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
as if i had asked them to pass the salt .PERIOD 
i was just staggered by it .PERIOD 
so we scanned their brains ,COMMA looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph ,COMMA with a distraction task in between .PERIOD 
so we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state .PERIOD 
and we found activity in a lot of brain regions .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA that's exactly what happens .PERIOD 
i began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i had always thought it was a series of emotions ,COMMA from very high to very low .PERIOD 
but actually ,COMMA it's a drive .PERIOD it comes from the motor of the mind ,COMMA the wanting part of the mind ,COMMA the craving part of the mind .PERIOD 
the kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate ,COMMA when you want to win that promotion at work .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA if you ask somebody to go to bed with you ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA no ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA you certainly don't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression .PERIOD 
but certainly ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA people who are rejected in love will kill for it .PERIOD 
people live for love .PERIOD they kill for love .PERIOD they die for love .PERIOD 
they have songs ,COMMA poems ,COMMA novels ,COMMA sculptures ,COMMA paintings ,COMMA myths ,COMMA legends .PERIOD 
in over <NUM> societies ,COMMA people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .PERIOD 
i have come to think it's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow .PERIOD 
and i've also come to think that it's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction .PERIOD 
one is the sex drive :COLON the craving for sexual gratification .PERIOD 
wh .PERIOD auden called it an intolerable neural itch ,COMMA and indeed ,COMMA that's what it is .PERIOD 
it keeps bothering you a little bit ,COMMA like being hungry .PERIOD 
the second of these three brain systems is romantic love :COLON that elation ,COMMA obsession of early love .PERIOD 
and the third brain system is attachment :COLON that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner .PERIOD 
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there ,COMMA looking for a whole range of partners .PERIOD 
it can be focused on nobody .PERIOD 
and i think that attachment ,COMMA the third brain system ,COMMA evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team .PERIOD 
so with that preamble ,COMMA i want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends .PERIOD 
one of the last <NUM> years and the other ,COMMA certainly of the last <NUM> years ,COMMA that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and deep attachment to a partner .PERIOD 
the first is women working ,COMMA moving into the workforce .PERIOD 
i've looked at <NUM> societies through the demographic yearbooks of the united nations .PERIOD 
and everywhere in the world ,COMMA <NUM> out of <NUM> of them ,COMMA women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power ,COMMA health and education .PERIOD 
it's very slow .PERIOD 
for every trend on this planet ,COMMA there's a counter-trend .PERIOD 
we all know of them ,COMMA but nevertheless -- the arabs say ,COMMA the dogs may bark ,COMMA but the caravan moves on .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA that caravan is moving on .PERIOD 
women are moving back into the job market .PERIOD 
and i say back into the job market ,COMMA because this is not new .PERIOD 
for millions of years ,COMMA on the grasslands of africa ,COMMA women commuted to work to gather their vegetables .PERIOD 
they came home with <NUM> to <NUM> percent of the evening meal .PERIOD 
the double income family was the standard .PERIOD 
and women were regarded as just as economically ,COMMA socially and sexually powerful as men .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA we're really moving forward to the past .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA women's worst invention was the plow .PERIOD 
with the beginning of plow agriculture ,COMMA men's roles became extremely powerful .PERIOD 
women lost their ancient jobs as collectors ,COMMA but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
we are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal .PERIOD 
and it's going to have an impact .PERIOD 
i generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community .PERIOD 
i'll only just say a couple of things ,COMMA and then go on to sex and love .PERIOD 
there's a lot of gender differences ;SEMICOLON anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child .PERIOD 
i don't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike .PERIOD 
there's much we have in common ,COMMA but there's a whole lot that we do not have in common .PERIOD 
we are -- in the words of ted hughes ,COMMA i think that we were built to be -- we're like two feet .PERIOD we need each other to get ahead .PERIOD 
but we did not evolve to have the same brain .PERIOD 
and we're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain .PERIOD 
i'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love .PERIOD 
one of them is women's verbal ability .PERIOD women can talk .PERIOD 
women's ability to find the right word rapidly ,COMMA basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle ,COMMA when estrogen levels peak .PERIOD 
but even at menstruation ,COMMA they're better than the average man .PERIOD 
women can talk .PERIOD 
they've been doing it for a million years ;SEMICOLON words were women's tools .PERIOD 
they held that baby in front of their face ,COMMA cajoling it ,COMMA reprimanding it ,COMMA educating it with words .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA they're becoming a very powerful force .PERIOD 
even in places like india and japan ,COMMA where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market ,COMMA they're moving into journalism .PERIOD 
and i think that the television is like the global campfire .PERIOD 
we sit around it and it shapes our minds .PERIOD 
almost always ,COMMA when i'm on tv ,COMMA the producers who call me ,COMMA who negotiate what we're going to say ,COMMA is a woman .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA solzhenitsyn once said ,COMMA to have a great writer is to have another government .PERIOD 
today <NUM> percent of people who are writers in america are women .PERIOD 
it's one of many ,COMMA many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .PERIOD 
we now know the brain circuitry of imagination ,COMMA of long-term planning .PERIOD 
they tend to be web thinkers .PERIOD 
because the female parts of the brain are better connected ,COMMA they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think ,COMMA put them into more complex patterns ,COMMA see more options and outcomes .PERIOD 
they tend to be contextual ,COMMA holistic thinkers ,COMMA what i call web thinkers .PERIOD 
men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous ,COMMA focus on what they do ,COMMA and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern .PERIOD 
they're both perfectly good ways of thinking .PERIOD 
we need both of them to get ahead .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there's many more male geniuses in the world .PERIOD 
when the -- and there's also many more male idiots in the world .PERIOD 
when the male brain works well ,COMMA it works extremely well .PERIOD 
and what i really think that we're doing is ,COMMA we're moving towards a collaborative society ,COMMA a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life .PERIOD 
foremost ,COMMA women are starting to express their sexuality .PERIOD 
i'm always astonished when people come to me and say ,COMMA why is it that men are so adulterous ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i say ,COMMA why do you think more men are adulterous than women ?QUESTIONMARK 
oh ,COMMA well -- men are more adulterous !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and i say ,COMMA who do you think these men are sleeping with ?QUESTIONMARK 
anyway .PERIOD 
in the western world ,COMMA women start sooner at sex ,COMMA have more partners ,COMMA express less remorse for the partners that they do ,COMMA marry later ,COMMA have fewer children ,COMMA leave bad marriages in order to get good ones .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA once again we're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of africa a million years ago ,COMMA because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today .PERIOD 
we're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .PERIOD 
they're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage ,COMMA or the pure marriage ,COMMA or the companionate marriage .PERIOD 
this is a marriage between equals ,COMMA moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit .PERIOD 
we're also seeing a rise of romantic love .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of american women and <NUM> percent of american men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner ,COMMA if they were not in love with that person .PERIOD 
people around the world ,COMMA in a study of <NUM> societies ,COMMA want to be in love with the person that they marry .PERIOD 
the first one being women moving into the job market ,COMMA the second one being the aging world population .PERIOD 
they're now saying that in america ,COMMA that middle age should be regarded as up to age <NUM> .PERIOD 
because in that highest age category of <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA as much as <NUM> percent of people have nothing really wrong with them .PERIOD 
so we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age .PERIOD 
and i looked -- for one of my books ,COMMA i looked at divorce data in <NUM> societies .PERIOD 
and as it turns out ,COMMA the older you get ,COMMA the less likely you are to divorce .PERIOD 
so the divorce rate right now is stable in america ,COMMA and it's actually beginning to decline .PERIOD 
i would even say that with viagra ,COMMA estrogen replacement ,COMMA hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now .PERIOD 
and so i honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages ,COMMA that time is now .PERIOD 
they can go together ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
that's why casual sex isn't so casual .PERIOD 
with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .PERIOD 
dopamine's associated with romantic love ,COMMA and you can just fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with .PERIOD 
with orgasm ,COMMA then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment .PERIOD 
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them .PERIOD 
but these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment ,COMMA aren't always connected to each other .PERIOD 
you can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else ,COMMA while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA we're capable of loving more than one person at a time .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .PERIOD 
it's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do .PERIOD 
so i don't think ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA we're an animal that was built to be happy ;SEMICOLON we are an animal that was built to reproduce .PERIOD 
i think the happiness we find ,COMMA we make .PERIOD 
and i think ,COMMA however ,COMMA we can make good relationships with each other .PERIOD 
so i want to conclude with two things .PERIOD 
i want to conclude with a worry -- i have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .PERIOD 
the worry is about antidepressants .PERIOD 
over <NUM> million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the united states .PERIOD 
and these drugs are going generic .PERIOD 
they are seeping around the world .PERIOD 
i know one girl who's been on these antidepressants ,COMMA serotonin-enhancing -- ssri ,COMMA serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was <NUM> .PERIOD 
she's <NUM> .PERIOD she's been on them ever since she was <NUM> .PERIOD 
i've got nothing against people who take them short term ,COMMA when they're going through something perfectly horrible .PERIOD 
they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .PERIOD 
i would recommend it .PERIOD 
but more and more people in the united states are taking them long term .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin .PERIOD 
and by raising levels of serotonin ,COMMA you suppress the dopamine circuit .PERIOD 
everybody knows that .PERIOD 
dopamine is associated with romantic love .PERIOD 
not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit ,COMMA but they kill the sex drive .PERIOD 
and when you kill the sex drive ,COMMA you kill orgasm .PERIOD 
and when you kill orgasm ,COMMA you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment .PERIOD 
the things are connected in the brain .PERIOD 
and when you tamper with one brain system ,COMMA you're going to tamper with another .PERIOD 
i'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place .PERIOD 
so now -- -- thank you .PERIOD 
i want to end with a story .PERIOD and then ,COMMA just a comment .PERIOD 
i've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i'm an identical twin ;SEMICOLON i am interested in why we're all alike .PERIOD 
why you and i are alike ,COMMA why the iraqis and the japanese and the australian aborigines and the people of the amazon river are all alike .PERIOD 
and about a year ago ,COMMA an internet dating service ,COMMA matchcom ,COMMA came to me and asked me if i would design a new dating site for them .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA i don't know anything about personality .PERIOD you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know .PERIOD do you think you've got the right person ?QUESTIONMARK 
they said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .PERIOD 
that's my current project ;SEMICOLON it will be my next book .PERIOD 
there's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another .PERIOD 
timing is important .PERIOD proximity is important .PERIOD 
mystery is important .PERIOD you fall in love with somebody who's somewhat mysterious ,COMMA in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain ,COMMA probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love .PERIOD 
you fall in love with somebody who fits within what i call your love map ,COMMA an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .PERIOD 
and i also think that you gravitate to certain people ,COMMA actually ,COMMA with somewhat complementary brain systems .PERIOD 
and that's what i'm now contributing to this .PERIOD 
i wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it ,COMMA too -- the magic of it .PERIOD 
it's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story .PERIOD 
it was a graduate student at -- i'm at rutgers and my two colleagues -- art aron is at suny stony brook .PERIOD 
that's where we put our people in the mri machine .PERIOD 
and this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student ,COMMA and she was not in love with him .PERIOD 
and they were all at a conference in beijing .PERIOD 
and he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody ,COMMA you can drive up the dopamine in the brain ,COMMA and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love .PERIOD 
so he decided he'd put science to work ,COMMA and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him .PERIOD 
and sure enough -- i've never been in one ,COMMA but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy and it's exciting .PERIOD 
and he figured that this would drive up the dopamine ,COMMA and she would fall in love with him .PERIOD 
so off they go and she's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time .PERIOD 
an hour later they get down off of the rickshaw ,COMMA and she throws her hands up and she says ,COMMA wasn't that wonderful ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's magic to love !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
but i will end by saying that millions of years ago ,COMMA we evolved three basic drives :COLON the sex drive ,COMMA romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
hello .PERIOD actually ,COMMA that's hello in bauer bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us .PERIOD 
and how do you bring those two things together ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is something that we believe in -- something i believe in ,COMMA and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at ideo .PERIOD 
i call this first chapter -- for the brits in the room -- the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious .PERIOD 
often ,COMMA the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them .PERIOD and i think ,COMMA a lot of times ,COMMA what we do is just ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA hold the mirror up to our clients ,COMMA and sort of go ,COMMA duh !EXCLAMATIONMARK you know ,COMMA look what's really going on .PERIOD 
and rather than talk about it in the theory ,COMMA i think i'm just going to show you an example .PERIOD 
we were asked by a large healthcare system in minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was .PERIOD 
and i think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this ,COMMA that and the other ,COMMA and all kinds of mappy stuff .PERIOD 
or even worse ,COMMA some kind of ghastly death-by-powerpoint thing with wowcharts and all kinds of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA god knows ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
the first thing we actually shared with them was this .PERIOD 
i'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve .PERIOD 
this is <NUM> seconds into the film .PERIOD 
this is a minute <NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
and just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is christian ,COMMA who works with us at ideo .PERIOD 
he just lay in the hospital bed ,COMMA and ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time .PERIOD 
that's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital .PERIOD 
and they were sort ,COMMA you know ,COMMA blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA my goodness .PERIOD so ,COMMA looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was ,COMMA for these guys ,COMMA quite a revelation .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA that was a really catalytic thing for them .PERIOD 
so they snapped into action .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA it's not about systemic change .PERIOD 
it's not about huge ,COMMA ridiculous things that we need to do .PERIOD 
it's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .PERIOD 
so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact .PERIOD 
the first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we band-aided it here ,COMMA onto a gurney ,COMMA a hospital trolley ,COMMA so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor ,COMMA you could actually have a conversation with them .PERIOD 
you could ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA see them in your rear-view mirror ,COMMA so it created a tiny human interaction .PERIOD 
very small example of something that they could do .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA the nurses themselves ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA snapped into action -- said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we embrace this .PERIOD what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling .PERIOD 
which i thought was really -- i showed this to my mother recently .PERIOD 
i think my mother now thinks that i'm some sort of interior decorator .PERIOD 
it's what i do for a living ,COMMA sort of laurence llewelyn-bowen .PERIOD 
not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA hard-core designers ,COMMA but nonetheless ,COMMA a fabulous empathic solution for people .PERIOD 
things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified ,COMMA this is my room .PERIOD this is my personal space -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem .PERIOD 
so you went from public space to private space .PERIOD 
and another idea ,COMMA again ,COMMA that came from one of the nurses -- which i love -- was they took traditional ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA corporate white boards ,COMMA then they put them on one wall of the patient's room ,COMMA and they put this sticker there .PERIOD 
so that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room ,COMMA which was lovely .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact .PERIOD 
i thought that was a really ,COMMA really nice example .PERIOD 
so this is not particularly a new idea ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution .PERIOD 
i'm going to read this because i want to get these names right .PERIOD 
joan ganz cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a saturday morning ,COMMA saw her daughter watching the test card ,COMMA waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came sesame street .PERIOD 
malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship .PERIOD 
and he invented the shipping container .PERIOD 
george de mestral -- this is not bugs all over a birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs ,COMMA sort of little prickly things ,COMMA and from that came velcro .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA for the brits ,COMMA percy shaw -- this is a big british invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road ,COMMA when he was driving home one night and from that came the catseye .PERIOD 
so there's a whole series of just using your eyes ,COMMA seeing things for the first time ,COMMA seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities .PERIOD 
second one ,COMMA without sounding overly zen ,COMMA and this is a quote from the buddha :COLON finding yourself in the margins ,COMMA looking to the edges of things ,COMMA is often a really interesting place to start .PERIOD 
blinkered vision tends to produce ,COMMA i think ,COMMA blinkered solutions .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA looking wide ,COMMA using your peripheral vision ,COMMA is a really interesting place to look for opportunity .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA another medical example here .PERIOD 
we were asked by a device producer -- we did the palm pilot and the treo .PERIOD 
we did a lot of sexy tech at ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics .PERIOD 
this was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital .PERIOD 
they'll ask the nurses to input data .PERIOD 
and they had this vision of the nurse ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA gadget-lustish .PERIOD 
when you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about ;SEMICOLON it was for pain management -- you're shit scared ;SEMICOLON you're freaking out .PERIOD 
and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did ,COMMA was hold the patient's hand to comfort them .PERIOD human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the thing that we designed ,COMMA much less sexy but much more human and practical ,COMMA was this .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination ,COMMA but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product .PERIOD 
and i think that's really ,COMMA really important .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA this idea of workarounds .PERIOD 
we use this phrase workarounds a lot ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA looking around us .PERIOD i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i've been here .PERIOD 
this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot .PERIOD 
we wrote a book recently ,COMMA i think you might have received it ,COMMA called thoughtless acts ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do ,COMMA which have huge intention and huge opportunity .PERIOD 
why do we all follow the line in the street ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a picture in a japanese subway .PERIOD 
people consciously follow things even though ,COMMA why ,COMMA we don't know .PERIOD 
why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle ?QUESTIONMARK 
again ,COMMA we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions .PERIOD 
and we're always saying to our clients :COLON you should look at this stuff .PERIOD 
this stuff is really important .PERIOD this stuff is really vital .PERIOD 
this is people designing their own experiences .PERIOD 
you can draw from this .PERIOD 
we sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street ,COMMA that it's okay to use it ,COMMA so we park our shopping cart there .PERIOD 
it's there for our use ,COMMA on some level .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things .PERIOD 
we co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another .PERIOD 
and this is my favorite one .PERIOD my mother used to say to me ,COMMA just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we all do .PERIOD we all follow each other every day .PERIOD 
so somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something ,COMMA that's permission for them to do the same thing .PERIOD 
and there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA shopping bag equals parking meter out of order .PERIOD 
and we all ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA know how to read these signals now .PERIOD 
we all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing .PERIOD 
third section is this idea of not knowing ,COMMA of consciously putting yourself backwards .PERIOD 
i talk about unthinking situations all the time .PERIOD 
sort of having beginner's mind ,COMMA scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh .PERIOD 
a friend of mine was a designer at ikea ,COMMA and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children .PERIOD 
this is the billy bookcase -- it's ikea's biggest selling product .PERIOD 
hammer it together .PERIOD hammer it together with a shoe ,COMMA if you're me ,COMMA because they're impossible to assemble .PERIOD 
but big selling bookcase .PERIOD how do we replicate this for children ?QUESTIONMARK 
the reality is when you actually watch children ,COMMA children don't think about things like storage in linear terms .PERIOD 
children assume permission in a very different way .PERIOD 
children live on things .PERIOD they live under things .PERIOD 
they live around things ,COMMA and so their spatial awareness relationship ,COMMA and their thinking around storage is totally different .PERIOD 
so the first thing you have to do -- this is graham ,COMMA the designer -- is ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA put yourself in their shoes .PERIOD and so ,COMMA here he is sitting under the table .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what came out of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is the storage system that he designed .PERIOD 
it's this ,COMMA and i think this is a particularly lovely solution .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a totally different way of looking at the situation .PERIOD 
it's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it .PERIOD 
but a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary ,COMMA and i think that's one of the things .PERIOD 
and putting yourself in the position of the person ,COMMA and i think that's one of the threads that i've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then use that information to fuel solutions ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think that's what this is very much about .PERIOD 
last section :COLON green armband .PERIOD we've all got them .PERIOD 
it's about this really .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA that's one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear in this conference is :COLON where do we start ?QUESTIONMARK how do we start ?QUESTIONMARK what do we do to start ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA again ,COMMA we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec ,COMMA in kenya .PERIOD 
they're now called kickstart .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA again ,COMMA as designers ,COMMA we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form .PERIOD 
and that was completely irrelevant .PERIOD 
when you put yourself in the position of these people ,COMMA things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle ,COMMA become much more relevant than the form of it .PERIOD the way it's produced ,COMMA it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials .PERIOD 
so it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user .PERIOD 
we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world .PERIOD 
it's powered a bit like a stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it .PERIOD 
children can use it .PERIOD adults can use it .PERIOD everybody uses it .PERIOD 
it's turning these guys -- again ,COMMA one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
and for us ,COMMA it's been great because it's won loads of design awards .PERIOD 
so we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company ,COMMA the needs of the individuals in the company ,COMMA to feel good about a product we were actually designing ,COMMA and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for .PERIOD 
there it is ,COMMA pumping water from <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
so as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning .PERIOD 
we've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start ,COMMA no pun intended ,COMMA their next project .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA again ,COMMA i think ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA putting our money where our mouth is ,COMMA here .PERIOD 
we feel that this is an important gesture .PERIOD 
so we've handed out bracelets .PERIOD small is the new big .PERIOD 
i hope you'll all wear them .PERIOD 
so that's it .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
as an architect you design for the present ,COMMA with an awareness of the past ,COMMA for a future which is essentially unknown .PERIOD 
the green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day .PERIOD 
and i'd like to share some experience over the last <NUM> years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability .PERIOD 
i think that -- i've said in the past ,COMMA many ,COMMA many years ago ,COMMA before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda ,COMMA that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival .PERIOD 
but what i never said ,COMMA and what i'm really going to make the point is ,COMMA that really ,COMMA green is cool .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA all the projects which have ,COMMA in some way ,COMMA been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle ,COMMA in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life .PERIOD 
i rarely actually quote anything ,COMMA so i'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i can ,COMMA [in] which somebody ,COMMA at the end of last year ,COMMA ventured the thought about what for that individual ,COMMA as a kind of important observer ,COMMA analyst ,COMMA writer -- a guy called thomas friedman ,COMMA who wrote in the herald tribune ,COMMA about <NUM> .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA i think the most important thing to happen in <NUM> was that living and thinking green hit main street .PERIOD 
we reached a tipping point this year where living ,COMMA acting ,COMMA designing ,COMMA investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens ,COMMA entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic ,COMMA capitalistic ,COMMA geo-political and competitive thing they could do .PERIOD 
hence my motto :COLON green is the new red ,COMMA white and blue .PERIOD 
and i asked myself ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA looking back ,COMMA when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think it was july <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA when ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA man could look back at planet earth .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA it was buckminster fuller who coined that phrase .PERIOD 
and before the kind of collapse of the communist system ,COMMA i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia .PERIOD 
and interestingly ,COMMA as i think back ,COMMA they were the first true environmentalists .PERIOD 
they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion ,COMMA fired about the problems of the aral sea .PERIOD 
and at that period it was -- in a way ,COMMA a number of things were happening .PERIOD 
buckminster fuller was the kind of green guru -- again ,COMMA a word that had not been coined .PERIOD 
he was a design scientist ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA a poet ,COMMA but he foresaw all the things that are happening now .PERIOD 
it's another subject .PERIOD it's another conversation .PERIOD 
you can go back to his writings :COLON it's quite extraordinary .PERIOD 
it was at that time ,COMMA with an awareness fired by bucky's prophecies ,COMMA his concerns as a citizen ,COMMA as a kind of citizen of the planet ,COMMA that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time .PERIOD 
and it's a number of projects .PERIOD 
i select this one because it was <NUM> ,COMMA and it was a master plan for one of the canary islands .PERIOD 
and this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet earth's sourcebook ,COMMA and you had the hippie movement .PERIOD 
and there are some of those qualities in this drawing ,COMMA which seeks to sum up the recommendations .PERIOD 
and in parallel at that time ,COMMA there was a very kind of exclusive design club .PERIOD 
people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams ,COMMA and the objects that he would create for the company called braun .PERIOD 
this is going back the mid-'50s ,COMMA '60s .PERIOD 
and despite bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort ,COMMA to amenities -- it was very ,COMMA very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image ,COMMA would be very ,COMMA very stylishly packaged .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA and more besides ,COMMA would be in the palm of your hand .PERIOD 
and i think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where ,COMMA as the virtual world ,COMMA which brings so many people together here ,COMMA finally connects with the physical world ,COMMA there is the reality that that has become humanized ,COMMA so that digital world has all the friendliness ,COMMA all the immediacy ,COMMA the orientation of the analog world .PERIOD 
probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here ,COMMA as we generously had gifted at lunchtime ,COMMA the [unclear] ,COMMA which is a further kind of development -- and again ,COMMA inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel .PERIOD 
a very ,COMMA very beautiful object .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA something which in [the] '50s ,COMMA '60s was very exclusive has now become ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA quite inclusive .PERIOD 
and the reference to the ipod as iconic ,COMMA and in a way evocative of performance ,COMMA delivery -- quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year <NUM> ,COMMA the financial times commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid ,COMMA energy-conscious vehicle ,COMMA which rivals the ipod as an iconic product .PERIOD 
and i think it's very tempting to ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA seduce ourselves -- as architects ,COMMA or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings .PERIOD 
buildings are important ,COMMA but they're only a component of a much bigger picture .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA as i might seek to demonstrate ,COMMA if you could achieve the impossible ,COMMA the equivalent of perpetual motion ,COMMA you could design a carbon-free house ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
that would be the answer .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA it's not the answer .PERIOD 
it's only the beginning of the problem .PERIOD 
you cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA that only shows part of the picture .PERIOD 
if you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the transport of people ,COMMA which is <NUM> percent ,COMMA then <NUM> percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together .PERIOD 
so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities ,COMMA of which the buildings are a part .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA if you take ,COMMA and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city ,COMMA what i'll call ,COMMA simplistically ,COMMA a north american city -- and detroit is not a bad example ,COMMA it is very car dependent .PERIOD 
the city goes out in annular rings ,COMMA consuming more and more green space ,COMMA and more and more roads ,COMMA and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again ,COMMA the city center ,COMMA as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial ,COMMA again becomes dead .PERIOD 
so basically ,COMMA if you wanted to generalize ,COMMA you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there ,COMMA that the energy consumed reduces dramatically .PERIOD 
of course you can't separate this out from issues like social diversity ,COMMA mass transit ,COMMA the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance ,COMMA the quality of civic spaces .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA you can see detroit ,COMMA in yellow at the top ,COMMA extraordinary consumption ,COMMA down below copenhagen .PERIOD 
and copenhagen ,COMMA although it's a dense city ,COMMA is not dense compared with the really dense cities .PERIOD 
in the year <NUM> ,COMMA a rather interesting thing happened .PERIOD 
you had for the first time mega-cities ,COMMA [of] <NUM> million or more ,COMMA which were occurring in the developing world .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA out of typically <NUM> cities ,COMMA <NUM> of those mega-cities are in the developing world .PERIOD 
so you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of ,COMMA for example ,COMMA china or india .PERIOD 
if you take china ,COMMA and you just take beijing ,COMMA you can see on that traffic system ,COMMA and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA if you put onto the roads ,COMMA as is currently happening ,COMMA <NUM> new cars every day -- statistically ,COMMA it's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing .PERIOD 
and that urbanization is extraordinary ,COMMA accelerated pace .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities ,COMMA which took <NUM> years ,COMMA then that same process is happening in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA it is accelerating by a factor of <NUM> .PERIOD 
and quite interestingly ,COMMA over something like a 60-year period ,COMMA we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy ,COMMA over that period where the urbanization has trebled .PERIOD 
if i pull back from that global picture ,COMMA and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which ,COMMA as a tool ,COMMA is a tool for designers ,COMMA and i cite our own experience as a company ,COMMA and i just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
and particularly ,COMMA how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy ,COMMA create less pollution and are more socially responsible ?QUESTIONMARK 
that story ,COMMA in terms of buildings ,COMMA started in the late '60s ,COMMA early '70s .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA the first thing you can see is that this building ,COMMA the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket ,COMMA a kind of insulating garden ,COMMA which is also about the celebration of public space .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA for this community ,COMMA they have this garden in the sky .PERIOD 
so the humanistic ideal is very ,COMMA very strong in all this work ,COMMA encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here ,COMMA where you can see greenery ,COMMA you can see sunlight ,COMMA you have a connection with nature .PERIOD 
and nature is part of the generator ,COMMA the driver for this building .PERIOD 
and symbolically ,COMMA the colors of the interior are green and yellow .PERIOD 
it has facilities like swimming pools ,COMMA it has flextime ,COMMA it has a social heart ,COMMA a space ,COMMA you have contact with nature .PERIOD 
now this was <NUM> .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA this building received an award .PERIOD 
and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time .PERIOD 
and the people who'd created it came back :COLON the project managers ,COMMA the company chairmen then .PERIOD 
and they were saying ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the architects ,COMMA norman was always going on about designing for the future ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA it didn't seem to cost us any more .PERIOD 
so we humored him ,COMMA we kept him happy .PERIOD 
the image at the top ,COMMA what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail ,COMMA really what it is saying is you can wire this building .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA the image there is of typewriters .PERIOD 
and when the photograph was taken ,COMMA it's word processors .PERIOD 
and what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology .PERIOD 
we were fortunate ,COMMA because in a way our building was future-proofed .PERIOD 
it anticipated change ,COMMA even though those changes were not known .PERIOD 
round about that design period leading up to this building ,COMMA i did a sketch ,COMMA which we pulled out of the archive recently .PERIOD 
and i was saying ,COMMA and i wrote ,COMMA but we don't have the time ,COMMA and we really don't have the immediate expertise at a technical level .PERIOD 
and that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate ,COMMA would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads .PERIOD 
notwithstanding the fact that the building ,COMMA as a green building ,COMMA is very much a pioneering building .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality .PERIOD 
and a combination of devices here ,COMMA the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks ,COMMA and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin ,COMMA which enables the building to be ventilated ,COMMA to consume dramatically less energy ,COMMA and where it's really working with the forces of nature .PERIOD 
and what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA coming back to that thing about the lifestyle ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit .PERIOD 
i think it's a great -- it's a celebration .PERIOD 
and you can measure the performance ,COMMA in terms of energy consumption ,COMMA of that building against a typical library .PERIOD 
if i show another aspect of that technology then ,COMMA in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the alps in switzerland .PERIOD 
prefabricated from the most traditional of materials ,COMMA but that material -- because of the technology ,COMMA the computing ability ,COMMA the ability to prefabricate ,COMMA make high-performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge .PERIOD 
so if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in germany ,COMMA and here you can see the guy with his computer screen ,COMMA and those points in space are communicated .PERIOD 
and on the left are the cutting machines ,COMMA which then ,COMMA in the factory ,COMMA enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very ,COMMA very few millimeters ,COMMA to be slotted together on site .PERIOD 
and then interestingly ,COMMA that building to then be clad in the oldest technology ,COMMA which is the kind of hand-cut shingles .PERIOD 
one quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA the way in which that works as a building ,COMMA for those of us who can enjoy the spaces ,COMMA to live and visit there .PERIOD 
if i made the leap into these new technologies ,COMMA then how did we -- what happened before that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what was life like before the mobile phone ,COMMA the things that you take for granted ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA obviously the building still happened .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is a glimpse of the interior of our hong kong bank of <NUM> ,COMMA which opened in <NUM> ,COMMA with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here .PERIOD 
and in the absence of computers ,COMMA you have to physically model .PERIOD 
so for example ,COMMA we would put models under an artificial sky .PERIOD 
and the turning point was probably ,COMMA in our terms ,COMMA when we had the first computer .PERIOD 
and that was at the time that we sought to redesign ,COMMA reinvent the airport .PERIOD 
this is terminal four at heathrow ,COMMA typical of any terminal -- big ,COMMA heavy roof ,COMMA blocking out the sunlight ,COMMA lots of machinery ,COMMA big pipes ,COMMA whirring machinery .PERIOD 
and stansted ,COMMA the green alternative ,COMMA which uses natural light ,COMMA is a friendly place :COLON you know where you are ,COMMA you can relate to the outside .PERIOD 
and for a large part of its cycle ,COMMA not needing electric light -- electric light ,COMMA which in turn creates more heat ,COMMA which creates more cooling loads and so on .PERIOD 
and at that particular point in time ,COMMA this was one of the few solitary computers .PERIOD 
and that's a little image of the tree of stansted .PERIOD 
not going back very far in time ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA that's our office .PERIOD 
and if you looked very closely ,COMMA you'd see that people were drawing with pencils ,COMMA and they were pushing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA big rulers and triangles .PERIOD 
it's not that long ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA and here we are now .PERIOD 
going back in time ,COMMA there was a lady called valerie larkin ,COMMA and in <NUM> ,COMMA she had all our information on one disk .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA every week ,COMMA we have the equivalent of <NUM> million disks ,COMMA which record our archival information on past ,COMMA current and future projects .PERIOD 
that reaches <NUM> kilometers into the sky .PERIOD 
this is the view you would get ,COMMA if you looked down on that .PERIOD 
but meanwhile ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA wonderful protagonists like al gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature ,COMMA set in the context of that ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA those buildings which are celebratory and very ,COMMA very relevant to this place .PERIOD 
our reichstag project ,COMMA which has a very familiar agenda ,COMMA i'm sure ,COMMA as a public place where we sought to ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA through a process of advocacy ,COMMA reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians ,COMMA public space .PERIOD and maybe its hidden agenda ,COMMA an energy manifesto -- something that would be free ,COMMA completely free of fuel as we know it .PERIOD 
so it would be totally renewable .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA the humanistic sketch ,COMMA the translation into the public space ,COMMA but this very ,COMMA very much a part of the ecology .PERIOD 
but here ,COMMA not having to model it for real .PERIOD 
obviously the wind tunnel had a place ,COMMA but the ability now with the computer to explore ,COMMA to plan ,COMMA to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature :COLON natural ventilation ,COMMA to be able to model the chamber below ,COMMA and to look at biomass .PERIOD 
a combination of biomass ,COMMA aquifers ,COMMA burning vegetable oil -- a process that ,COMMA quite interestingly ,COMMA was developed in eastern germany ,COMMA at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc .PERIOD 
so really ,COMMA retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean ,COMMA it was virtually pollution-free .PERIOD 
you can measure it again .PERIOD 
you can compare how that building ,COMMA in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project ,COMMA over <NUM> tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally ,COMMA with the vegetable oil ,COMMA <NUM> tons .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA a <NUM> percent reduction -- virtually clean .PERIOD 
we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation ,COMMA the way that you can model those gardens ,COMMA the way they spiral around .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA very much about the lifestyle ,COMMA the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption .PERIOD 
there is an evolution here between the projects ,COMMA and swiss re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in london .PERIOD 
and this sequence shows the buildup of that model .PERIOD 
but what it shows first ,COMMA which i think is quite interesting ,COMMA is that here you see the circle ,COMMA you see the public space around it .PERIOD 
what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site ?QUESTIONMARK 
if ,COMMA for example ,COMMA you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement ,COMMA it's the same amount of space .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA you profile this ,COMMA you cut grooves into it .PERIOD 
the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views ,COMMA which give light ,COMMA ventilation ,COMMA make the building fresher .PERIOD 
and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance ,COMMA which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again ,COMMA in a long connection evocative of some of those works of buckminster fuller ,COMMA and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria ,COMMA the way in which now ,COMMA with a computer ,COMMA we can model the forces ,COMMA we can see the high pressure ,COMMA the low pressure ,COMMA the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing .PERIOD 
so it also has the ability ,COMMA all the time ,COMMA regardless of the direction of the wind ,COMMA to be able to make the building fresh and efficient .PERIOD 
and unlike conventional buildings ,COMMA the top of the building is celebratory .PERIOD 
it's a viewing place for people ,COMMA not machinery .PERIOD 
and the base of the building is again about public space .PERIOD 
comparing it with a typical building ,COMMA what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project .PERIOD 
the level is dropping ,COMMA rather like the aral sea .PERIOD 
and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it .PERIOD 
so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline ,COMMA a pipe ,COMMA sometimes above the surface ,COMMA sometimes buried ,COMMA that will redress that ,COMMA and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea .PERIOD 
and our translation of that ,COMMA using a lot of the thinking built up over the <NUM> years ,COMMA is to say ,COMMA what if that ,COMMA instead of being just a pipe ,COMMA what if it is a lifeline ?QUESTIONMARK 
what if it is the equivalent ,COMMA depending on where you are ,COMMA of the grand canal ,COMMA in terms of tourists ,COMMA habitation ,COMMA desalination ,COMMA agriculture ?QUESTIONMARK 
in other words ,COMMA water is the lifeblood .PERIOD 
and if you just go back to the previous image ,COMMA and you look at this area of volatility and hostility ,COMMA that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause ,COMMA in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense .PERIOD 
infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication .PERIOD 
and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world ,COMMA then it's absolutely central to society .PERIOD 
and how do we make more legible in this growing world ,COMMA especially in some of the places that i'm talking about -- china ,COMMA for example ,COMMA which in the next ten years will create <NUM> new airports .PERIOD 
now what form do they take ?QUESTIONMARK 
so what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the chinese society ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega-building .PERIOD 
it is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment .PERIOD 
larger by <NUM> percent than every terminal put together at heathrow -- built -- plus the new ,COMMA un-built terminal five .PERIOD 
and the challenge here is a building that will be green ,COMMA that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel ,COMMA is about friendly ,COMMA is coming back to that starting point ,COMMA is very ,COMMA very much about the lifestyle .PERIOD 
and perhaps these ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA as celebratory spaces .PERIOD 
as hubert was talking over lunch ,COMMA as we sort of engaged in conversation ,COMMA talked about this ,COMMA talked about cities .PERIOD 
hubert was saying ,COMMA absolutely correctly ,COMMA these are the new cathedrals .PERIOD 
and in a way ,COMMA one aspect of this conversation was triggered on new year's eve ,COMMA when i was talking about the olympic agenda in china in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations .PERIOD 
and i was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that new year's eve ,COMMA a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from <NUM> to <NUM> -- that maybe ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the future was the most powerful ,COMMA innovative sort of nation .PERIOD 
the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say ,COMMA we put a man on the moon .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels ,COMMA with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and that's a concerted platform .PERIOD 
it's more than one device ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's renewable .PERIOD 
and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year ,COMMA i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other ,COMMA larger countries out there -- the chinas ,COMMA the indias ,COMMA the asian-pacific tigers .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
even in the times of h1n1 ,COMMA i like the word .PERIOD 
inspiration is contagious .PERIOD 
we've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers .PERIOD 
but for me ,COMMA what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA why only them ?QUESTIONMARK 
in a country of a billion people and some ,COMMA why so few ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it luck ?QUESTIONMARK is it chance ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA in the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story .PERIOD 
i got infected when i was <NUM> ,COMMA when ,COMMA as a student of the design college ,COMMA i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas ,COMMA challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me .PERIOD 
and i was struck by just how wonderful it felt ,COMMA and how contagious that feeling was .PERIOD 
i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when i started riverside school <NUM> years ago it became a lab ,COMMA a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the i can bug .PERIOD 
and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context ,COMMA that if you blur the boundaries between school and life ,COMMA then children go through a journey of aware ,COMMA where they can see the change ,COMMA enable ,COMMA be changed ,COMMA and then empower ,COMMA lead the change .PERIOD 
children became more competent ,COMMA and less helpless .PERIOD 
but this was all common sense .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at riverside .PERIOD 
a little background :COLON when my grade five was learning about child rights ,COMMA they were made to roll incense sticks ,COMMA agarbattis ,COMMA for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer .PERIOD 
it transformed them .PERIOD what you will see is their journey ,COMMA and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world .PERIOD 
that's them rolling .PERIOD 
and in two hours ,COMMA after their backs were broke ,COMMA they were changed .PERIOD 
and once that happened ,COMMA they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .PERIOD 
and look at ragav ,COMMA that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when ragav experienced that he went from teacher told me ,COMMA to i am doing it .PERIOD and that's the i can mindshift .PERIOD 
and it is a process that can be energized and nurtured .PERIOD 
but we had parents who said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA making our children good human beings is all very well ,COMMA but what about math and science and english ?QUESTIONMARK 
show us the grades .PERIOD 
and we did .PERIOD the data was conclusive .PERIOD 
when children are empowered ,COMMA not only do they do good ,COMMA they do well ,COMMA in fact very well ,COMMA as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over <NUM> schools in india ,COMMA riverside children were outperforming the top <NUM> schools in india in math ,COMMA english and science .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it worked .PERIOD it was now time to take it outside riverside .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA on august 15th ,COMMA independence day ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA the children of riverside set out to infect ahmedabad .PERIOD 
now it was not about riverside school .PERIOD 
it was about all children .PERIOD so ,COMMA we were shameless .PERIOD 
we walked into the offices of the municipal corporation ,COMMA the police ,COMMA the press ,COMMA businesses ,COMMA and basically said ,COMMA when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child ?QUESTIONMARK 
when will you include the child in the city ?QUESTIONMARK 
basically ,COMMA open your hearts and your minds to the child .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how did the city respond ?QUESTIONMARK 
since <NUM> every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood .PERIOD 
here was a city telling its child ,COMMA you can .PERIOD 
a glimpse of infection in ahmedabad .PERIOD 
video :COLON [unclear] so ,COMMA the busiest streets closed down .PERIOD 
we have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us .PERIOD 
it gets taken over by children .PERIOD 
they are skating .PERIOD they are doing street plays .PERIOD 
they are playing ,COMMA all free ,COMMA for all children .PERIOD 
atul karwal :COLON aproch is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier .PERIOD

geet sethi :COLON when a city gives to the children ,COMMA in the future the children will give back to the city .PERIOD 
kbs :COLON and because of that ,COMMA ahmedabad is known as india's first child-friendly city .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you're getting the pattern .PERIOD first <NUM> children at riverside .PERIOD 
then <NUM> children in ahmedabad ,COMMA and growing .PERIOD 
it was time now to infect india .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA on august 15th ,COMMA again ,COMMA independence day ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA empowered with the same process ,COMMA we empowered <NUM> children to say ,COMMA i can .PERIOD 
how ?QUESTIONMARK we designed a simple toolkit ,COMMA converted it into eight languages ,COMMA and reached <NUM> schools .PERIOD 
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .PERIOD 
we said ,COMMA take one idea ,COMMA anything that bothers you ,COMMA choose one week ,COMMA and change a billion lives .PERIOD 
and they did .PERIOD stories of change poured in from all over india ,COMMA from nagaland in the east ,COMMA to jhunjhunu in the west ,COMMA from sikkim in the north ,COMMA to krishnagiri in the south .PERIOD 
children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems .PERIOD 
right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism ,COMMA and <NUM> children who stopped <NUM> child marriages in rajasthan .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it was incredible .PERIOD 
basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say ,COMMA you can ,COMMA then they will .PERIOD 
infection in india .PERIOD 
this is in rajasthan ,COMMA a rural village .PERIOD 
child :COLON our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write .PERIOD

street plays ,COMMA auctions ,COMMA petitions .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA they were changing lives .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how can we still stay immune ?QUESTIONMARK 
how can we stay immune to that passion ,COMMA that energy ,COMMA that excitement ?QUESTIONMARK 
i know it's obvious ,COMMA but i have to end with the most powerful symbol of change ,COMMA gandhiji .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of we can .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA today who is it going to take to spread the infection from <NUM> children to the <NUM> million children in india ?QUESTIONMARK 
last i heard ,COMMA the preamble still said ,COMMA we ,COMMA the people of india ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA if not us ,COMMA then who ?QUESTIONMARK 
if not now ,COMMA then when ?QUESTIONMARK 
like i said ,COMMA contagious is a good word .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages ,COMMA in the slums ,COMMA in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius ,COMMA without any outside help .PERIOD 
when our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of india ,COMMA about <NUM> districts that he mentioned were ungovernable ,COMMA he missed the point .PERIOD 
the point that we have been stressing for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA the point that people may be economically poor ,COMMA but they're not poor in the mind .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds .PERIOD 
that is the message ,COMMA which we started <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and what did it start ?QUESTIONMARK 
let me just tell you ,COMMA briefly ,COMMA my personal journey ,COMMA which led me to come to this point .PERIOD 
in '<NUM> ,COMMA '<NUM> ,COMMA i was in bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands ,COMMA on the fields of the poor people ,COMMA and how to develop research technologies ,COMMA which are based on the knowledge of the people .PERIOD 
i came back in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
i had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that i found in that country ,COMMA which had <NUM> percent landlessness but amazing creativity .PERIOD 
i started looking at my own work :COLON the work that i had done for the previous <NUM> years ,COMMA almost every time ,COMMA had instances of knowledge that people had shared .PERIOD 
was it because i'm brilliant that i'm getting this reward ,COMMA or because of the revolution ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it that i write very well ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it that i articulate very well ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it that i analyze the data very well ?QUESTIONMARK 
is it because i'm a professor ,COMMA and ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA i must be entitled to this reward from society ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor ,COMMA and ,COMMA therefore i think it's okay .PERIOD 
but it appeared to me that all these years that i'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords ,COMMA by moneylenders ,COMMA by traders -- gave me an insight that probably i was also an exploiter ,COMMA because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them .PERIOD 
so much so ,COMMA that much of my work till that time was in the english language .PERIOD 
the majority of the people from whom i learned didn't know english .PERIOD 
so what kind of a contributor was i ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was talking about social justice ,COMMA and here i was ,COMMA a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people ,COMMA making them anonymous ,COMMA getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy ,COMMA writing papers and publishing them in the papers ,COMMA getting invited to the conferences ,COMMA getting consultancies and whatever have you .PERIOD 
so then ,COMMA a dilemma rose in the mind that ,COMMA if i'm also an exploiter ,COMMA then this is not right ;SEMICOLON life cannot go on like that .PERIOD 
so i did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research ,COMMA wrote ,COMMA read about <NUM> papers .PERIOD 
and i came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique ,COMMA dilemma is not unique ;SEMICOLON the solution had to be unique .PERIOD 
and one day -- i don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home ,COMMA maybe i saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the honey bee ,COMMA life would be wonderful .PERIOD 
what the honey bee does :COLON it pollinates ,COMMA takes nectar from the flower ,COMMA pollinates another flower ,COMMA cross-pollinates .PERIOD 
and when it takes the nectar ,COMMA the flowers don't feel shortchanged .PERIOD 
they must not remain anonymous .PERIOD 
and i must tell you that after <NUM> years ,COMMA i have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art .PERIOD 
that is a great tragedy -- which i'm carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous .PERIOD 
the research guidelines of us .PERIOD national academy of sciences or research councils of the uk .PERIOD 
or of indian councils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people ,COMMA you must share back with them .PERIOD 
we are talking about an accountable society ,COMMA a society that is fair and just ,COMMA and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market .PERIOD 
and india wants to be a knowledge society .PERIOD 
how will it be a knowledge society ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA you cannot have two principles of justice ,COMMA one for yourself and one for others .PERIOD 
it must be the same .PERIOD 
you cannot be in favor of your own values ,COMMA which are at a distance from the values that you espouse .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA fairness to one and to the other is not divisible .PERIOD 
look at this picture .PERIOD 
can you tell me where has it been taken from ,COMMA and what is it meant for ?QUESTIONMARK anybody ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm a professor ;SEMICOLON i must quiz you .PERIOD 
anybody ?QUESTIONMARK any guess at all ?QUESTIONMARK 
pardon ?QUESTIONMARK 
anil gupta :COLON but what has it been used for ?QUESTIONMARK what has it been used for ?QUESTIONMARK 
pardon ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA you're so right .PERIOD we must give him a hand ,COMMA because this man knows how insensitive our government is .PERIOD 
look at this .PERIOD this is the site of the government of india .PERIOD 
it invites tourists to see the shame of our country .PERIOD 
is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
it depends upon how you look at the life of the people .PERIOD 
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles ,COMMA you cannot be celebrating that .PERIOD 
we should be doing something about it .PERIOD 
and let me tell you ,COMMA with all the science and technology at our command ,COMMA millions of women still carry water on their heads .PERIOD 
and we do not ask this question .PERIOD 
you must have taken tea in the morning .PERIOD 
think for a minute .PERIOD 
the leaves of the tea ,COMMA plucked from the bushes ;SEMICOLON you know what the action is ?QUESTIONMARK the action is :COLON the lady picks up a few leaves ,COMMA puts them in the basket on the backside .PERIOD 
just do it <NUM> times ;SEMICOLON you will realize the pain in this shoulder .PERIOD 
and she does it a few thousand times every day .PERIOD 
and every year ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the paddy is transplanted manually .PERIOD 
no machines have been developed .PERIOD 
so the silence of scientists ,COMMA of technologists ,COMMA of public policy makers ,COMMA of the change agent ,COMMA drew our attention that this is not on ,COMMA this is not on ;SEMICOLON this is not the way society will work .PERIOD 
this is not what our parliament would do .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we have a program for employment :COLON one hundred ,COMMA <NUM> million people have to be given jobs for <NUM> days by this great country .PERIOD 
doing what ?QUESTIONMARK breaking stones ,COMMA digging earth .PERIOD 
so we asked a question to the parliament :COLON do poor have heads ?QUESTIONMARK 
do poor have legs ,COMMA mouth and hands ,COMMA but no head ?QUESTIONMARK 
so honey bee network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich .PERIOD 
and what has happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
an anonymous ,COMMA faceless ,COMMA nameless person gets in contact with the network ,COMMA and then gets an identity .PERIOD 
this is what honey bee network is about .PERIOD 
and this network grew voluntarily ,COMMA continues to be voluntary ,COMMA and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative .PERIOD 
they could be creative in terms of education ,COMMA they may be creative in terms of culture ,COMMA they may be creative in terms of institutions ;SEMICOLON but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity ,COMMA the innovations ,COMMA either in terms of contemporary innovations ,COMMA or in terms of traditional knowledge .PERIOD 
and it all begins with curiosity .PERIOD 
it all begins with curiosity .PERIOD 
this person ,COMMA whom we met -- and you will see it on the website ,COMMA wwwsristiorg -- this tribal person ,COMMA he had a wish .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA if my wish gets fulfilled -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- god ,COMMA please cure him .PERIOD 
and if you cure him ,COMMA i will get my wall painted .PERIOD 
somebody was talking yesterday about maslowian hierarchy .PERIOD 
kabir ,COMMA rahim ,COMMA all the great sufi saints ,COMMA they were all poor people ,COMMA and they had a great reason .PERIOD 
please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment .PERIOD 
any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment ,COMMA only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something .PERIOD 
look at this .PERIOD 
we saw it in shodh yatra .PERIOD every six months we walk in different parts of the country .PERIOD 
i've walked about <NUM> kilometers in the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
so on the wayside we found these dung cakes ,COMMA which are used as a fuel .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this lady ,COMMA on the wall of the dung cake heap ,COMMA has made a painting .PERIOD 
that's the only space she could express her creativity .PERIOD 
and she's so marvelous .PERIOD 
look at this lady ,COMMA ram timari devi ,COMMA on a grain bin .PERIOD in champaran ,COMMA we had a shodh yatra and we were walking in the land where gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy ,COMMA pain of indigo growers .PERIOD 
bhabi mahato in purulia and bankura .PERIOD 
look at what she has done .PERIOD 
the whole wall is her canvas .PERIOD she's sitting there with a broom .PERIOD 
is she an artisan or an artist ?QUESTIONMARK 
obviously she's an artist ;SEMICOLON she's a creative person .PERIOD 
if we can create markets for these artists ,COMMA we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones .PERIOD 
they will be paid for what they are good at ,COMMA not what they're bad at .PERIOD 
look at what rojadeen has done .PERIOD 
in motihari in champaran ,COMMA there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA there's a limited market for tea .PERIOD 
every morning you have tea ,COMMA as well as coffee .PERIOD 
so he thought ,COMMA why don't i convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this is a coffee machine .PERIOD just takes a few hundred rupees .PERIOD 
people bring their own cooker ,COMMA he attaches a valve and a steam pipe ,COMMA and now he gives you espresso coffee .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is a real ,COMMA affordable coffee percolator that works on gas .PERIOD 
look at what sheikh jahangir has done .PERIOD 
a lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground .PERIOD 
so this fellow is bringing a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler .PERIOD 
if you have <NUM> grams ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA one kilogram ,COMMA he will grind it for it for you ;SEMICOLON the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity .PERIOD 
please understand the problem of poor people .PERIOD 
they have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy ,COMMA in terms of cost ,COMMA in terms of quality .PERIOD 
they don't want second-standard ,COMMA second-quality outputs .PERIOD 
but to be able to give them high-quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs .PERIOD 
and that is what sheikh jahangir did .PERIOD 
but that's not enough ,COMMA what he did .PERIOD look at what he did here .PERIOD 
if you have clothes ,COMMA and you don't have enough time to wash them ,COMMA he brought a washing machine to your doorstep ,COMMA mounted on a two-wheeler .PERIOD 
he is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep .PERIOD 
you bring your water ,COMMA you bring your soap ,COMMA i wash the clothes for you .PERIOD charge <NUM> paisa ,COMMA one rupee for you per lot ,COMMA and a new business model can emerge .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what we need is ,COMMA we need people who will be able to scale them up .PERIOD 
look at this .PERIOD 
it looks like a beautiful photograph .PERIOD 
but you know what it is ?QUESTIONMARK can anybody guess what it is ?QUESTIONMARK 
somebody from india would know ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
it's a tawa .PERIOD 
it's a hot plate made of clay .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA what is the beauty in it ?QUESTIONMARK 
when you have a non-stick pan ,COMMA it costs about ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA <NUM> rupees ,COMMA five dollars ,COMMA six dollars .PERIOD 
this is less than a dollar and this is non-stick ;SEMICOLON it is coated with one of these food-grade materials .PERIOD 
and the best part is that ,COMMA while you use a costly non-stick pan ,COMMA you eat the so-called teflon or teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears .PERIOD where has it gone ?QUESTIONMARK 
it has gone in your stomach .PERIOD it was not meant for that .PERIOD 
you know ?QUESTIONMARK but here in this clay hot plate ,COMMA it will never go into your stomach .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper ,COMMA need not be ,COMMA so-called ,COMMA jugaad ,COMMA need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement .PERIOD 
they have to be better ,COMMA they have to be more efficient ,COMMA they have to be affordable .PERIOD 
and that is what mansukh bhai prajapati has done .PERIOD 
he has designed this plate with a handle .PERIOD 
and now with one dollar ,COMMA you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you .PERIOD 
this lady ,COMMA she developed a herbal pesticide formulation .PERIOD 
we filed the patent for her ,COMMA the national innovation foundation .PERIOD 
and who knows ?QUESTIONMARK somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products ,COMMA and she would get revenue .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me mention one thing :COLON i think we need a polycentric model of development ,COMMA where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country ,COMMA in different parts of the world ,COMMA would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner .PERIOD 
higher the local fit ,COMMA greater is the chance of scaling up .PERIOD 
in the scaling up ,COMMA there's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people ,COMMA point by point ,COMMA with the supply that you're making .PERIOD 
things can scale up ,COMMA and they have scaled up .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it is possible that i use only two buttons on the cellphone ,COMMA only three options on the cellphone .PERIOD 
it has <NUM> options ,COMMA i'm paying for <NUM> ;SEMICOLON i'm using only three but i'm willing to live with it ,COMMA therefore it is scaling up .PERIOD 
but if i had to get a match to match ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA i would need a different design of a cellphone .PERIOD 
so what we're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability .PERIOD 
there must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA one can be able to fund them .PERIOD 
one of the greatest studies that we've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- what is a scalable model ?QUESTIONMARK -- as if the need of a community ,COMMA which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places ,COMMA has no legitimate right to get them for free because it's not part of a larger scale .PERIOD 
so either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out .PERIOD 
and we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio ,COMMA will invest in the portfolio ,COMMA where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA the overall platform of the model will become viable .PERIOD 
saidullah sahib is an amazing man .PERIOD 
at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA he is linking up something very creative .PERIOD 
saidullah sahib :COLON i couldn't wait for the boat .PERIOD 
i had to meet my love .PERIOD 
my desperation made me an innovator .PERIOD 
even love needs help from technology .PERIOD 
innovation is the light of my wife ,COMMA noor .PERIOD 
new inventions are the passion of my life .PERIOD 
my technology .PERIOD 
saidulluh sahib is in motihari ,COMMA again in champaran .PERIOD 
wonderful human being ,COMMA but he stills sells ,COMMA at this age ,COMMA honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood ,COMMA because we haven't been able to convince the water park people ,COMMA the lake people ,COMMA in [unclear] operations .PERIOD 
and we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk <NUM> kilometers ,COMMA wading in the water -- that ,COMMA look ,COMMA you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go ,COMMA where your transport will not go .PERIOD 
so we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device ,COMMA as a vending device during the floods in eastern india ,COMMA when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned .PERIOD 
but the idea has a merit .PERIOD the idea has a merit .PERIOD 
what has appachan done ?QUESTIONMARK appachan ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA is no more ,COMMA but he has left behind a message .PERIOD 
a very powerful message appachan :COLON i watch the world wake up every day .PERIOD 
it's not that a coconut fell on my head ,COMMA and i came upon this idea .PERIOD 
with no money to fund my studies ,COMMA i scaled new heights .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA they call me the local spiderman .PERIOD 
my technology .PERIOD 
many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what i call a g2g model ,COMMA grassroots to global .PERIOD 
and a professor in the university of massachusetts ,COMMA in the zoology department ,COMMA bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy .PERIOD 
and this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms ,COMMA rather than only a few ,COMMA because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we are advancing the frontiers of science .PERIOD 
remya jose has developed . .PERIOD 
you can go to the youtube and find india innovates and then you will find these videos .PERIOD 
innovation by her when she was in class 10th :COLON a washing machine-cum-exercising machine .PERIOD 
mr .PERIOD kharai who is a physically challenged person ,COMMA one and a half foot height ,COMMA only .PERIOD 
this innovation is from the slums of rio .PERIOD 
and this person ,COMMA mr .PERIOD ubirajara .PERIOD 
we were talking about ,COMMA my friends in brazil ,COMMA how we scale up this model in china and brazil .PERIOD 
this stand on the front wheel ,COMMA you will not find on any cycle .PERIOD 
india and china have the largest number of cycles .PERIOD 
but this innovation emerged in brazil .PERIOD 
the point is ,COMMA none of us should be parochial ,COMMA none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people ,COMMA wherever they are .PERIOD 
and look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations :COLON cycle that's a sprayer ,COMMA cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road .PERIOD 
that is what kanak das has done .PERIOD 
and in south africa ,COMMA we had taken our innovators ,COMMA and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in south africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have .PERIOD 
there's an axle here ,COMMA of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> kg ,COMMA serving no purpose .PERIOD 
remove it ,COMMA the cart needs one donkey less .PERIOD 
these three people in the village sat down and decided to think ,COMMA how do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ?QUESTIONMARK 
they were not related to her ,COMMA but they tried to find out ,COMMA how can we use . .PERIOD they used a cycle ,COMMA they put together a breathing apparatus .PERIOD 
and this breathing apparatus now saved the life ,COMMA and she's very welcome .PERIOD 
assam ,COMMA kanak gogoi .PERIOD 
and you would not find this car in us .PERIOD or europe ,COMMA but this is available in india .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this lady ,COMMA she used to do the winding of the yarn for pochampally saree .PERIOD 
in one day ,COMMA <NUM> times ,COMMA she had to do this winding to generate two sarees .PERIOD 
this is what her son has done after seven years of struggle .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA change your profession .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA i can't .PERIOD this is the only thing i know ,COMMA but i'll invent a machine ,COMMA which will solve your problem .PERIOD 
and this is what he did ,COMMA a sewing machine in uttar pradesh .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is what sristi is saying :COLON give me a place to stand ,COMMA and i will move the world .PERIOD 
i will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity ,COMMA a whole range of things .PERIOD 
we have sold things all over the world ,COMMA from ethiopia to turkey to us .PERIOD to wherever .PERIOD 
products have gone to the market ,COMMA a few .PERIOD 
these are the people whose knowledge made this herbavate cream for eczema possible .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it ,COMMA it asks the user ,COMMA you can also be an innovator .PERIOD 
if you have an idea ,COMMA send it back to us .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA creativity counts ,COMMA knowledge matters ,COMMA innovations transform ,COMMA incentives inspire .PERIOD 
and incentives :COLON not just material ,COMMA but also non-material incentives .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
there's a beautiful statement on the screen that says ,COMMA light creates ambiance ,COMMA light makes the feel of a space ,COMMA and light is also the expression of structure .PERIOD 
well that was not by me .PERIOD 
that was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA by le corbusier ,COMMA the famous architect .PERIOD 
and here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel notre dame du haut ,COMMA ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark .PERIOD 
and i think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness .PERIOD 
so this is how we normally would light our offices .PERIOD 
we have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity .PERIOD 
this is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps .PERIOD 
and that is quite different from what i just showed you from le corbusier .PERIOD 
if we would apply these codes and standards to the pantheon in rome ,COMMA it would never have looked like this ,COMMA because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building .PERIOD 
and the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said ,COMMA light :COLON i make it in my buildings for comfort .PERIOD 
he meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun .PERIOD 
and he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky ,COMMA and where you can experience the sun ,COMMA that give us a better life in the built environment ,COMMA just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows .PERIOD 
what it all boils down to is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the sun .PERIOD 
and this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive ,COMMA but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the sun ,COMMA and light is only a manifestation of that energy .PERIOD 
the sun is for dynamics ,COMMA for color changes .PERIOD 
the sun is for beauty in our environment ,COMMA like in this building -- the high museum in atlanta ,COMMA which has been created by renzo piano from italy ,COMMA together with arup lighting ,COMMA a brilliant team of lighting designers ,COMMA who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space ,COMMA responding to what the sun does outside ,COMMA just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof .PERIOD 
and here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models ,COMMA with quantitative ,COMMA as well as qualitative ,COMMA methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture .PERIOD 
as you can see here ,COMMA there's some direct light on the floor ,COMMA but they could easily figure out where that comes from .PERIOD 
and they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun ,COMMA the good part of the sun .PERIOD 
and enjoying the sun can be in many different ways ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
it can be just like this ,COMMA or maybe like this ,COMMA which is rather peculiar ,COMMA but this is in <NUM> -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the united states .PERIOD 
and it's just a bit bright up there ,COMMA so these people have found a very intriguing solution .PERIOD 
this is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA a very illustrative image of what i try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun ,COMMA bringing these into the building ,COMMA creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives .PERIOD 
and this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because otherwise you don't see these dynamics .PERIOD 
as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk ,COMMA this is a well-known office ,COMMA which is the white group .PERIOD 
they are in green energy consulting ,COMMA or something like that .PERIOD 
and they really practice what they preach because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all .PERIOD 
it has only on one side this big ,COMMA big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range .PERIOD 
so it can be very dim over there ,COMMA and you do your work ,COMMA and it can be very bright over there ,COMMA and you do your work .PERIOD 
but actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull ,COMMA and therefore helps us to enhance our lives .PERIOD 
i really owe a short introduction of this man to you .PERIOD 
in the 1930s ,COMMA richard kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design .PERIOD 
and he coined three terms ,COMMA which are focal glow ,COMMA ambient luminescence and play of the brilliants -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience .PERIOD 
so you begin with focal glow .PERIOD 
or something like this ,COMMA which is the lighting design he did for general motors ,COMMA for the car showroom .PERIOD 
and you enter that space ,COMMA and you feel like ,COMMA wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK this is so impressive ,COMMA just because of this focal point ,COMMA this huge light source in the middle .PERIOD 
to me it is something from theatre ,COMMA and i will get back to that a little bit later .PERIOD 
it's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus .PERIOD 
it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land ,COMMA highlighting it compared to the dim environment .PERIOD 
or it can be in today's retail ,COMMA in the shopping environment -- lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around .PERIOD 
ambient luminescence is something very different .PERIOD 
richard kelly saw it as something infinite ,COMMA something without any focus ,COMMA something where all details actually dissolve in infinity .PERIOD 
and i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate .PERIOD 
it could also be something like this :COLON the national museum of science in london ,COMMA where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA kelly's play of brilliants attitude ,COMMA that really some play of the skyline of hong kong ,COMMA or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house ,COMMA or in the theater here ,COMMA which is a decoration ,COMMA the icing on the cake ,COMMA something playful ,COMMA something that is just an addition to the architectural environment ,COMMA i would say .PERIOD 
and we can only create these out of darkness .PERIOD 
and i will explain that further .PERIOD 
and i guess that is something that richard kelly ,COMMA here on the left ,COMMA was explaining to ludwig mies van der rohe .PERIOD 
and behind them ,COMMA you see that seagram building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design .PERIOD 
those times ,COMMA there were some early attempts also for light therapy already .PERIOD 
you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine ,COMMA where people are put in the sun to get better .PERIOD 
it's a little bit of a different story ,COMMA this health aspect of light ,COMMA than what i'm telling you today .PERIOD 
in today's modern medicine ,COMMA there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way .PERIOD 
and there is the idea that ,COMMA when we look at things ,COMMA it is the yellow light that helps us the most ,COMMA that we are the most sensitive for .PERIOD 
but our circadian rhythms ,COMMA which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on ,COMMA they are much more triggered by blue light .PERIOD 
and by modulating the amount of blue in our environment ,COMMA we can help people to relax ,COMMA or to be alert ,COMMA to fall asleep ,COMMA or to stay awake .PERIOD 
and that is how ,COMMA maybe in the near future ,COMMA light can help hospitals to make people better sooner ,COMMA recover them quicker .PERIOD 
maybe in the airplane ,COMMA we can overcome jet lag like that .PERIOD 
perhaps in school ,COMMA we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work .PERIOD 
and you can imagine a lot more applications .PERIOD 
but i would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life .PERIOD 
so light is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us .PERIOD 
it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other .PERIOD 
and it is all about this planet .PERIOD 
but when you look at this planet at night ,COMMA it looks like this .PERIOD 
and i think this is the most shocking image in my talk today .PERIOD 
because all this light here goes up to the sky .PERIOD 
it never reaches the ground where it was meant for .PERIOD 
it never is to the benefit of people .PERIOD 
it only spoils the darkness .PERIOD 
so at a global scale ,COMMA it looks like this .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA that is quite amazing ,COMMA what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground .PERIOD 
because if we look at the earth the way it should be ,COMMA it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything .PERIOD 
the world is changing though ,COMMA and urbanization is a big driver of everything .PERIOD 
i took this photo two weeks ago in guangzhou ,COMMA and i realized that <NUM> years ago ,COMMA there was nothing like this ,COMMA of these buildings .PERIOD 
it was just a much smaller city ,COMMA and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous .PERIOD 
and we have to understand these main questions :COLON how do people move through these new urban spaces ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do we tackle things like mobility ?QUESTIONMARK 
and how can light help there ?QUESTIONMARK 
because the new technologies ,COMMA they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments .PERIOD 
it's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that .PERIOD 
now we have led ,COMMA but here you see the latest one ,COMMA and you see how incredibly small it is .PERIOD 
and this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny ,COMMA tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it .PERIOD 
and we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness .PERIOD 
so that is a really interesting proposition ,COMMA i think ,COMMA and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind .PERIOD 
so i asked our laboratory to do something about it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we can do something .PERIOD 
they created for me the biggest led in the world especially for tedx in amsterdam .PERIOD 
so here it is .PERIOD 
it's the same thing as you can see over there -- just <NUM> times bigger .PERIOD 
and i will very quickly show you how it works .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA every led that is made these days gives blue light .PERIOD 
now this is not very pleasant and comfortable .PERIOD 
and for that reason ,COMMA we cover the led with a phosphor cap .PERIOD 
and the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant .PERIOD 
and then when you add the lens to that ,COMMA you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else .PERIOD 
so you can preserve the darkness and make the light .PERIOD 
i just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
we can go further .PERIOD 
so we have to rethink the way we light our cities .PERIOD 
we have to think again about light as a default solution .PERIOD 
is it really needed ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we be more gentle with light ?QUESTIONMARK 
like here -- this is a very low light level actually .PERIOD 
or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around ?QUESTIONMARK 
and can we preserve the darkness ?QUESTIONMARK 
because to find a place like this today on earth is really very ,COMMA very challenging .PERIOD 
and to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult .PERIOD 
even in the oceans ,COMMA we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well-being .PERIOD 
and it's known that migrating birds ,COMMA for example ,COMMA get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms .PERIOD 
and we discovered that ,COMMA when we make those lights green ,COMMA the birds ,COMMA they actually go the right way .PERIOD 
they are not disturbed anymore .PERIOD 
and it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here .PERIOD 
in all of these examples ,COMMA i think ,COMMA we should start making the light out of darkness ,COMMA and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do ,COMMA like edward hopper in this painting .PERIOD 
i think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting .PERIOD 
i think ,COMMA when i see it ,COMMA i start to think ,COMMA who are those people ?QUESTIONMARK 
what just happened ?QUESTIONMARK what will be happening in the next five minutes ?QUESTIONMARK 
edward hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark .PERIOD 
and we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments .PERIOD 
we can do that in commercial spaces like this .PERIOD 
and you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe ,COMMA which is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the universe itself .PERIOD 
so i give you this wonderful ,COMMA informative image of the sky ,COMMA ranging from the inner city ,COMMA where you may see one or two stars and nothing else ,COMMA all the way to the rural environments ,COMMA where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars .PERIOD 
in architecture ,COMMA it works just the same .PERIOD 
by appreciating the darkness when you design the light ,COMMA you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives .PERIOD 
this is the most well-known example ,COMMA tadao ando's church of light .PERIOD 
but i also think of peter zumthor's spa in vals ,COMMA where light and dark ,COMMA in very gentle combinations ,COMMA alter each other to define the space .PERIOD 
or richard mccormack's southern tube station in london ,COMMA where you can really see the sky ,COMMA even though you are under the ground .PERIOD 
and finally i want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater .PERIOD 
and i think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing tedx in a theater for the first time because i think we really owe to the theater a big thanks .PERIOD 
it wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater .PERIOD 
and i think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
as you pointed out ,COMMA every time you come here ,COMMA you learn something .PERIOD 
this morning ,COMMA the world's experts from i guess three or four different companies on building seats ,COMMA i think concluded that ultimately ,COMMA the solution is ,COMMA people shouldn't sit down .PERIOD 
i could have told them that .PERIOD 
yesterday ,COMMA the automotive guys gave us some new insights .PERIOD 
that's reassuring .PERIOD 
they then pointed out that there'd be ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA the other controls by wire ,COMMA to get rid of all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD 
that's pretty good ,COMMA but why not get rid of the wires ?QUESTIONMARK 
then you don't need anything to control the car ,COMMA except thinking about it .PERIOD 
i would love to talk about the technology ,COMMA and sometime ,COMMA in what's past the <NUM> minutes ,COMMA i'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what's in here .PERIOD 
but if i had one thing to say about this ,COMMA before we get to first ,COMMA it would be that from the time we started building this ,COMMA the big idea wasn't the technology .PERIOD 
and maybe to put that in perspective :COLON there's so much data on this ,COMMA i'll be happy to give it to you in different forms .PERIOD 
you never know what strikes the fancy of whom ,COMMA but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world .PERIOD 
and henry ford ,COMMA just about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA started cranking out model ts .PERIOD 
what i don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied .PERIOD 
it was half as long .PERIOD 
and it was an environmental improvement ,COMMA because ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA in <NUM> they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown manhattan ,COMMA because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses ,COMMA and a million of them urinating and doing other things ,COMMA and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable .PERIOD 
so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy .PERIOD 
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm ,COMMA or their farm to a town ,COMMA or from a town to a city .PERIOD 
by the 1950s ,COMMA we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world ,COMMA the highway system .PERIOD 
and it is certainly a wonder .PERIOD 
and by the way ,COMMA as i take shots at old technologies ,COMMA i want to assure everybody ,COMMA and particularly the automotive industry -- who's been very supportive of us -- that i don't think this in any way competes with airplanes ,COMMA or cars .PERIOD 
but think about where the world is today .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the global population now lives in cities .PERIOD 
that's <NUM> billion people .PERIOD 
we've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA sailing ships started getting reliable enough ;SEMICOLON we found a new continent .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA locomotives got efficient enough ,COMMA steam power ,COMMA that we turned the continent into a country .PERIOD 
over the last hundred years ,COMMA we started building cars ,COMMA and then over the <NUM> years we've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way ,COMMA and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that .PERIOD 
but during that entire process ,COMMA more and more people have been born ,COMMA and more and more people are moving to cities .PERIOD 
china alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA nobody ,COMMA i think ,COMMA would argue that airplanes ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood .PERIOD 
and if you just look at how technology has been applied ,COMMA we've solved all the long-range ,COMMA high-speed ,COMMA high-volume ,COMMA large-weight problems of moving things around .PERIOD 
nobody would want to give them up .PERIOD 
and i certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane ,COMMA or my helicopter ,COMMA or my humvee ,COMMA or my porsche .PERIOD 
i love them all .PERIOD i don't keep any of them in my living room .PERIOD 
the fact is ,COMMA the last mile is the problem ,COMMA and half the world now lives in dense cities .PERIOD 
and people spend ,COMMA depending on who they are ,COMMA between <NUM> and <NUM> percent of their energy getting around on foot .PERIOD 
i think there's -- i don't know what data would impress you ,COMMA but how about ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA i say that not to attack any industry ,COMMA i think -- i really do -- i love my airplane ,COMMA and cars on highways moving <NUM> miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient ,COMMA both from an engineering point of view ,COMMA an energy consumption point of view ,COMMA and a utility point of view .PERIOD 
and we all love our cars ,COMMA and i do .PERIOD 
the problem is ,COMMA you get into the city and you want to go four blocks ,COMMA it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive .PERIOD 
it's not sustainable .PERIOD 
if -- in china ,COMMA in the year <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> million people used bicycles ;SEMICOLON <NUM> million people used cars .PERIOD 
if five percent of that population became ,COMMA quote ,COMMA middle class ,COMMA and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that <NUM> percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan ,COMMA every six weeks -- it isn't sustainable environmentally ;SEMICOLON it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil -- and it's not sustainable politically .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA what are we fighting over right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
we can make it complicated ,COMMA but what's the world fighting over right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
so it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile ,COMMA and it was dumb luck .PERIOD we were working on ibots ,COMMA but once we made this ,COMMA we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis .PERIOD you don't need the water .PERIOD 
or snowmobiles .PERIOD you don't need the snow .PERIOD 
or skiing .PERIOD it's just fun ,COMMA and people love to move around doing fun things .PERIOD 
and every one of those industries ,COMMA by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry .PERIOD 
but rather than go license this off ,COMMA which is what we normally do ,COMMA it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology ,COMMA but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems ,COMMA but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which ,COMMA right back from ancient greece on ,COMMA were meant to walk around ,COMMA cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that ,COMMA while we've solved every other transportation problem -- and it's like moore's law .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA look at the time it took to cross a continent in a conestoga wagon ,COMMA then on a railroad ,COMMA then an airplane .PERIOD 
every other form of transportation's been improved .PERIOD 
in <NUM> years ,COMMA we've gone backwards in getting around cities .PERIOD 
they've gotten bigger ;SEMICOLON they're spread out .PERIOD 
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- wilshire boulevard ,COMMA or fifth avenue ,COMMA or tokyo ,COMMA or paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars .PERIOD 
the <NUM> largest cities in the world .PERIOD 
so you wonder ,COMMA what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities ?QUESTIONMARK 
what if you could make them fun ,COMMA attractive ,COMMA clean ,COMMA environmentally friendly ?QUESTIONMARK 
what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this ,COMMA as that last link to mass transit ,COMMA to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want ,COMMA and then have our cities energized again ?QUESTIONMARK 
we thought it would be really neat to do that ,COMMA and one of the problems we really were worried about is :COLON how do we get legal on the sidewalk ?QUESTIONMARK 
because technically i've got motors ;SEMICOLON i've got wheels -- i'm a motor vehicle .PERIOD 
i have the same footprint as a pedestrian ;SEMICOLON i have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space .PERIOD 
i took this down to ground zero ,COMMA and knocked my way through crowds for an hour .PERIOD 
i'm a pedestrian .PERIOD but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two ,COMMA and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk ,COMMA we have two choices .PERIOD 
or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle .PERIOD 
we've been so concerned about that ,COMMA we went to the postmaster general of the united states ,COMMA as the first person we ever showed on the outside ,COMMA and said ,COMMA put your people on it .PERIOD everybody trusts their postman .PERIOD 
and they belong on the sidewalks ,COMMA and they'll use it seriously .PERIOD 
he agreed .PERIOD we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat ,COMMA carrying <NUM> pounds of stuff .PERIOD they love it .PERIOD 
and i can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket .PERIOD 
so we've been working really ,COMMA really hard ,COMMA but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what's important ,COMMA and how to apply the technology .PERIOD 
we went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things ,COMMA and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm happy ,COMMA really ,COMMA i am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want .PERIOD 
and yes ,COMMA it's really fun ,COMMA and yes ,COMMA you should all go out and try it .PERIOD 
but if i could ask you to do one thing ,COMMA it's not to think about it as a piece of technology ,COMMA but just imagine that ,COMMA although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4000-pound machine ,COMMA which can go <NUM> miles an hour ,COMMA that can bring you everywhere you want to go ,COMMA and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile ,COMMA and it's broken ,COMMA and it doesn't work .PERIOD 
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted ,COMMA happened out here in california .PERIOD 
a few weeks ago ,COMMA after we launched it ,COMMA we were here with a news crew on venice beach ,COMMA zipping up and back ,COMMA and he's marveling at the technology ,COMMA and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by ,COMMA and skateboarders are zipping by ,COMMA and a little old lady -- i mean ,COMMA if you looked in the dictionary ,COMMA a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that i'm on this ,COMMA i'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops ,COMMA and the camera is there ,COMMA and she looks up at me and says ,COMMA can i try that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and what was i -- you know ,COMMA how are you going to say anything ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i said ,COMMA sure .PERIOD 
so i get off ,COMMA and she gets on ,COMMA and with a little bit of the usual ,COMMA ah ,COMMA then she turns around ,COMMA and she goes about <NUM> feet ,COMMA and she turns back around ,COMMA and she's all smiles .PERIOD 
and she comes back to me and she stops ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA finally ,COMMA they made something for us .PERIOD 
and the camera is looking down at her .PERIOD 
i'm thinking ,COMMA wow ,COMMA that was great -- -- please lady ,COMMA don't say another word .PERIOD 
and the camera is down at her ,COMMA and this guy has to put the microphone in her face ,COMMA said ,COMMA what do you mean by that ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i figured ,COMMA it's all over now ,COMMA and she looks up and she says ,COMMA well ,COMMA she's still watching these guys go ;SEMICOLON she says ,COMMA i can't ride a bike ,COMMA no ,COMMA she says ,COMMA i can't use a skateboard ,COMMA and i've never used roller blades ,COMMA she knew them by name ;SEMICOLON she says ,COMMA and it's been <NUM> years since i rode a bicycle .PERIOD 
i still have to get to the store ,COMMA and i can't carry a lot of things .PERIOD 
and it suddenly occurred to me ,COMMA that among my many fears ,COMMA were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA you believe there's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left ,COMMA the sidewalks in these cities .PERIOD 
when you look at the <NUM> inches of legal requirement for sidewalk ,COMMA then the eight foot for the parked car ,COMMA then the three lanes ,COMMA and then the other eight feet -- it's -- that little piece is all that's there .PERIOD 
but she looks up and says this ,COMMA and it occurs to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA kids aren't going to mind these things ,COMMA and they don't vote ,COMMA and business people and then young adults aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool -- so i guess subliminally i was worried that it's the older population that's going to worry .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA having seen this ,COMMA and having worried about it for eight years ,COMMA the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys ,COMMA call aarp ,COMMA get an appointment right away .PERIOD 
we've got to show them this thing .PERIOD 
and they took it to washington ;SEMICOLON they showed them ;SEMICOLON and they're going to be involved now ,COMMA watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities ,COMMA like atlanta ,COMMA where we're doing trials to see if it really can ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA help re-energize their downtown .PERIOD 
the bottom line is ,COMMA whether you believe the united nations ,COMMA or any of the other think tanks -- in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA all human population growth on this planet will be in cities .PERIOD 
in asia alone ,COMMA it will be over a billion people .PERIOD 
they learned to start with cell phones .PERIOD 
they didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took .PERIOD 
they start at the top of the technology food chain .PERIOD 
we've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense ,COMMA rich ,COMMA green-space environment ,COMMA without being in a 4000-pound machine to do it .PERIOD 
cars were not meant for parallel parking ;SEMICOLON they're wonderful machines to go between cities ,COMMA but just think about it :COLON we've solved all the long-range ,COMMA high-speed problems .PERIOD 
the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals .PERIOD 
you do it in your sneakers .PERIOD 
not much has changed .PERIOD 
if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
your choice ,COMMA when living in a city ,COMMA if it's now <NUM> minutes -- because at <NUM> minutes you want an alternative ,COMMA whether it's a bus ,COMMA a train -- we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you're going to keep parking those cars .PERIOD 
but if you could put a pin in most cities ,COMMA and imagine how far you could ,COMMA if you had the time ,COMMA walk in one half-hour ,COMMA it's the city .PERIOD 
if you could make it fun ,COMMA and make it eight or <NUM> minutes ,COMMA you can't find your car ,COMMA un-park your car ,COMMA move your car ,COMMA re-park your car and go somewhere ;SEMICOLON you can't get to a cab or a subway .PERIOD 
we could change the way people allocate their resources ,COMMA the way this planet uses its energy ,COMMA make it more fun .PERIOD 
and we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right .PERIOD 
that's segway .PERIOD this is a stirling cycle engine ;SEMICOLON this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing .PERIOD 
this little beast ,COMMA right now ,COMMA is producing a few hundred watts of electricity .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA it could be attached to this ,COMMA and yes ,COMMA on a kilogram of propane ,COMMA you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose .PERIOD 
perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel ,COMMA because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact ,COMMA where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet .PERIOD 
we've been working on this ,COMMA actually ,COMMA as an alternative energy source ,COMMA starting way back with johnson &amp ;SEMICOLON johnson ,COMMA to run an ibot ,COMMA because the best batteries you could get -- <NUM> watt-hours per kilogram in lead ,COMMA <NUM> watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium ,COMMA <NUM> watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride ,COMMA <NUM> watt-hours per kilogram in lithium ,COMMA <NUM> watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA in any event ,COMMA if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove ,COMMA if you can burn any fuel ,COMMA it turns out to be pretty neat .PERIOD 
it makes just enough electricity to ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA do this ,COMMA which at night is enough electricity ,COMMA in the rest of the world ,COMMA as mr .PERIOD holly -- dr .PERIOD holly -- pointed out ,COMMA can run computers and a light bulb .PERIOD 
but more interestingly ,COMMA the thermodynamics of this say ,COMMA you're never going to get more than <NUM> percent efficiency .PERIOD 
it doesn't matter much -- it says if you get <NUM> watts of electricity ,COMMA you'll get <NUM> or <NUM> watts of heat .PERIOD 
if you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of <NUM> gallons an hour ,COMMA it takes about <NUM> ,COMMA a little over <NUM> kilowatt -- <NUM> watts of continuous power -- to do it .PERIOD 
that's so much energy ,COMMA you couldn't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way .PERIOD 
certainly ,COMMA in the rest of the world ,COMMA your choice is to devastate the place ,COMMA turning everything that will burn into heat ,COMMA or drink the water that's available .PERIOD 
the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water .PERIOD 
depending on whose numbers you believe ,COMMA it's between <NUM> and <NUM> people per day .PERIOD 
we don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world .PERIOD 
and women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it ,COMMA or watching their kids die .PERIOD 
i don't know ,COMMA but we'll try it .PERIOD 
i better shut up .PERIOD

thank you .PERIOD 
i'd like to speak about technology trends ,COMMA which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow ,COMMA for related reasons .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA being a technology magazine ,COMMA technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about .PERIOD 
but also it's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future .PERIOD and we have a long lead-time .PERIOD 
we have to plan issues many months in advance ;SEMICOLON we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months ,COMMA nine months down the road .PERIOD so we're in the forecasting business .PERIOD 
we also ,COMMA like a lot of companies ,COMMA create a product that's based on technology trends .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA ours is about ideas and information ,COMMA and ,COMMA if we're lucky ,COMMA some entertainment .PERIOD but the concept's quite the same .PERIOD 
and so we have to understand not only why tech's important ,COMMA where it's going ,COMMA but also ,COMMA very importantly ,COMMA when -- the timing is everything .PERIOD 
and it's interesting ,COMMA when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s ,COMMA about e-commerce ,COMMA or internet traffic ,COMMA or broadband adoption ,COMMA or internet advertising ,COMMA they were all right -- they were just wrong in time .PERIOD 
almost every one of those has come true just a few years later .PERIOD 
but the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme .PERIOD and that's why timing is everything .PERIOD 
you've probably seen something like this before .PERIOD 
this is the classic gartner hype curve ,COMMA which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan .PERIOD 
and just for fun ,COMMA we put a bunch of technologies on it ,COMMA to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak ,COMMA or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment ,COMMA or rise back in the slope of enlightenment ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and this is one way to do technology forecasting :COLON get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn .PERIOD 
we want to be the first to do it ,COMMA for the geeks who appreciate that ,COMMA we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger .PERIOD 
you can see in <NUM> ,COMMA we put linux on the cover .PERIOD 
but then it comes back .PERIOD and sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream ,COMMA and they're going to burst out .PERIOD 
and that's one way that we try to time technology trends .PERIOD 
i'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future ,COMMA but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future .PERIOD 
it's based on the presumption ,COMMA the observation even ,COMMA that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages ,COMMA sometimes all four of the stages .PERIOD 
and at each one of these stages ,COMMA can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example ,COMMA a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world .PERIOD it's an inflection point .PERIOD 
and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be ,COMMA and maybe how you can do something about it .PERIOD 
the first is the critical price .PERIOD 
the first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price .PERIOD 
many technologies ,COMMA at that point ,COMMA displace another technology ,COMMA and that's another important point .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA a lot of technologies commoditize .PERIOD 
towards the end of their life ,COMMA they become nearly free .PERIOD 
each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it ;SEMICOLON it's an opportunity for the technology to change .PERIOD 
and even if you missed ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the first boom of wi-fi -- you know ,COMMA wi-fi did the critical price ,COMMA it did the critical mass ,COMMA but hasn't done displacement yet ,COMMA and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that .PERIOD 
i'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd ,COMMA which is a technology which has done all of these .PERIOD 
the dvd ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive .PERIOD but you can see that by <NUM> ,COMMA it had fallen below <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and <NUM> dollars was a psychological threshold .PERIOD 
and it started to take off .PERIOD and you can see that the units started to trend up ,COMMA the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off .PERIOD 
the next thing it hit ,COMMA a year later ,COMMA was critical mass .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA <NUM> percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household .PERIOD 
and what's interesting here is that something else took off along with it :COLON home-theater units .PERIOD 
suddenly you have a dvd in the house ;SEMICOLON you've got high-quality digital video ;SEMICOLON you have a reason to have a big-screen television ;SEMICOLON you have a reason for dolby <NUM> surround-sound .PERIOD 
what's interesting also is -- note that netflix was founded in <NUM> .PERIOD 
reed hastings is here .PERIOD he clearly saw that that was a moment ,COMMA that was an inflection point that he could do something with .PERIOD 
the next phase it hit was displacement .PERIOD 
you can see around <NUM> it finally out-sold the vcr .PERIOD 
and here too ,COMMA you can see the implications in the world at large .PERIOD 
netflix was right -- the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't .PERIOD 
among the dvd's many assets is that it's very small ;SEMICOLON you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply .PERIOD 
that gave an advantage ;SEMICOLON that was an implication of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA dvds are approaching free .PERIOD 
there's a company called apex ,COMMA a no-name chinese firm ,COMMA who has ,COMMA several times in the past year ,COMMA been the number-one dvd seller in america .PERIOD their average price ,COMMA for last year ,COMMA was <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
you're aware of the perhaps apocryphal wal-mart stampede over the 30-dollar dvd .PERIOD 
but they're getting very ,COMMA very cheap ,COMMA and look at the interesting implication of it .PERIOD as they get cheaper ,COMMA the premium brands ,COMMA the sonys and such ,COMMA are losing market share ,COMMA and the no-names ,COMMA the apexes ,COMMA are gaining them .PERIOD 
they're being commodified ,COMMA and that's what happens when things go to zero .PERIOD it's a tough market out there .PERIOD 
now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology ,COMMA these four stages of technology's life .PERIOD 
i'd like to talk about some other technologies out there ,COMMA just technologies on our radar -- and i'll use this lens ,COMMA these four ,COMMA as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .PERIOD 
they're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods .PERIOD 
but i think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers ,COMMA these intersections ,COMMA are interesting to think about .PERIOD 
start with gene sequencing .PERIOD 
as you probably know ,COMMA gene sequencing -- in a large part ,COMMA because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a moore's law-like level .PERIOD 
it is now possible -- will be possible ,COMMA and if craig venter indeed comes today ,COMMA he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for <NUM> million dollars by the end of this year .PERIOD 
that's as opposed to billions just a few years ago .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer .PERIOD 
what's interesting is that at the same time ,COMMA the number of genes that we're discovering is rising very quickly .PERIOD 
each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .PERIOD 
there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done ,COMMA very cheaply ,COMMA if you want to know .PERIOD you can learn about your own mosaic .PERIOD 
here's another technology that's approaching a critical price .PERIOD 
in january <NUM> ,COMMA the price was <NUM> dollars ,COMMA or <NUM> dollars a day .PERIOD 
the generics came in ,COMMA first in brazil and elsewhere ,COMMA and the effect was just dramatic on pricing .PERIOD 
today it's less than <NUM> cents a day .PERIOD 
and what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity ,COMMA if you look at the correlation between these two ,COMMA as the anti-retrovirals come down ,COMMA the number of people you can treat goes radically up .PERIOD and the clinton foundation and who believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by <NUM> -- two million in sub-saharan africa .PERIOD 
and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that .PERIOD 
now we've switched to critical mass .PERIOD 
these are now technologies that are hitting critical mass .PERIOD 
if you look here ,COMMA here's linux in red ,COMMA and it's hit <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA it's done a crossover before ,COMMA but not the crossovers that matter .PERIOD 
the crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue .PERIOD 
but you can look and see the direction those lines are going ,COMMA you can see that at the <NUM> percent ,COMMA it's now taken seriously .PERIOD 
it's not just for the geeks any more .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA i imagine ,COMMA what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about .PERIOD 
another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars .PERIOD 
i don't know whether anybody has a prius <NUM> ,COMMA but they're fantastic .PERIOD 
and if you look at the trends here ,COMMA by about <NUM> -- and i don't think this is a crazy forecast -- they'll be two percent of auto sales .PERIOD 
at two percent ,COMMA you start seeing them on the roads everywhere .PERIOD 
and what's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry .PERIOD 
it's the first radical change in automobile technology in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and once you have electric motors ,COMMA you can do anything :COLON you can change the structure of the car in any way you want .PERIOD 
you can have regenerative braking ;SEMICOLON you can have drive-by-wire ;SEMICOLON you can have replaceable body shapes -- it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid ,COMMA but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .PERIOD 
voice over ip is something you may have heard something about .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA it's kind of coming out of nowhere ;SEMICOLON it's a little hard to use right now .PERIOD 
there's a company created by the kazaa founders called skype .PERIOD 
look at these numbers .PERIOD they launched it in august of last year ;SEMICOLON they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass .PERIOD 
and the same thing's happening on the carrier side .PERIOD 
you're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards .PERIOD this is a tipping point -- if malcolm's here ,COMMA forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics ,COMMA and the speed ,COMMA and the players in the industry .PERIOD 
it's going to look a little bit like that .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA free .PERIOD free is really ,COMMA really interesting .PERIOD 
free is really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the gift of silicon valley to the world .PERIOD 
it's a deflationary force ,COMMA if not handled right .PERIOD 
it is abundance ,COMMA as opposed to scarcity .PERIOD 
free is probably the most interesting thing .PERIOD 
and here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive .PERIOD 
and you've seen the numbers .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes ,COMMA and hollywood's worried as well .PERIOD 
they're facing a force that they haven't faced before .PERIOD 
and their response is draconian ,COMMA and not necessarily the one that's going to get them out of this .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA i'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all .PERIOD i mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free .PERIOD 
this is the price of a phone call to india per minute .PERIOD 
and what's interesting is that it was just <NUM> when it was more than two dollars a minute .PERIOD 
india had ,COMMA still has ,COMMA a regulated phone system and so did we .PERIOD 
it was surprisingly non-innovative ,COMMA moved very slowly ,COMMA but then there was just so much fiber out there ,COMMA you couldn't hold back ,COMMA and look how quickly the price fell .PERIOD 
it's seven cents a minute ,COMMA in many cases .PERIOD 
and the consequence of cheap phone calling ,COMMA free phone calling ,COMMA to india ,COMMA is the pissed-off programmer ,COMMA is the outsourcing .PERIOD 
it is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we're seeing in our world today .PERIOD 
the force of india ,COMMA and then china ,COMMA and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt .PERIOD 
and i think that's probably one of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
clearly ,COMMA we're living in a moment of crisis .PERIOD 
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us ,COMMA and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive .PERIOD 
because of the resources ,COMMA the skills ,COMMA and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world ,COMMA with the mindset to create change .PERIOD 
and we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen ,COMMA who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower ,COMMA but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world .PERIOD 
you work on the front lines .PERIOD and you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another .PERIOD 
and no matter what country you live or work in ,COMMA you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of ,COMMA even in their most ordinariness .PERIOD 
today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty ,COMMA how best we release their energies .PERIOD 
on the one hand ,COMMA we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out .PERIOD 
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .PERIOD 
and what i want to talk about is something that compliments both systems .PERIOD 
we call it patient capital .PERIOD 
the critics point to the <NUM> billion dollars spent in africa since <NUM> and say ,COMMA and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty ,COMMA rampant corruption ?QUESTIONMARK 
they use mobutu as metaphor .PERIOD 
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable ,COMMA focus on the capital markets ,COMMA invest ,COMMA don't give anything away .PERIOD 
on the other side ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA there are those who say the problem is that we need more money .PERIOD 
that when it comes to the rich ,COMMA we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid ,COMMA but when it comes to our poor brethren ,COMMA we want little to do with it .PERIOD 
they point to the successes of aid :COLON the eradication of smallpox ,COMMA and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals .PERIOD 
both sides are right .PERIOD 
and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other .PERIOD 
after <NUM> years of working on issues of poverty and innovation ,COMMA it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people .PERIOD 
they must navigate markets daily ,COMMA making micro-decisions ,COMMA dozens and dozens ,COMMA to move their way through society ,COMMA and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family ,COMMA they could be put back into poverty ,COMMA sometimes for generations .PERIOD 
and so we need both the market and we need aid .PERIOD 
patient capital works between ,COMMA and tries to take the best of both .PERIOD 
it's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare ,COMMA water ,COMMA housing ,COMMA alternative energy ,COMMA thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity ,COMMA but as individual customers ,COMMA consumers ,COMMA clients ,COMMA people who want to make decisions in their own lives .PERIOD 
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk ,COMMA a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment ,COMMA to use the market as the best listening device that we have ,COMMA and the expectation of below-market returns ,COMMA but outsized social impact .PERIOD 
it recognizes that the market has its limitation ,COMMA and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA they tend to work in markets where people make one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level .PERIOD 
second ,COMMA the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of ,COMMA sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption .PERIOD 
third ,COMMA they are often creating markets .PERIOD 
even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages ,COMMA it is something new .PERIOD 
and so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time ,COMMA takes a lot of patience .PERIOD 
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance .PERIOD 
not only to build the systems ,COMMA the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way ,COMMA but to connect those business to other markets ,COMMA to governments ,COMMA to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale .PERIOD 
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation .PERIOD 
they were creating subsidies either for large farms ,COMMA or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use ,COMMA rather than that the farmers wanted to use .PERIOD 
at the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel .PERIOD 
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant .PERIOD 
and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green .PERIOD 
the average small village farmer works on two acres or less .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves ,COMMA because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have .PERIOD 
and he used three fundamental principles .PERIOD 
the first one was miniaturization .PERIOD 
the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre ,COMMA even if he had two ,COMMA because it was too frightening ,COMMA given all that he had at stake .PERIOD 
second ,COMMA it had to be extremely affordable .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest ,COMMA or else they wouldn't take the risk .PERIOD 
and third ,COMMA it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable .PERIOD 
what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre ,COMMA the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth .PERIOD 
as of today ,COMMA ide india ,COMMA amitabha's organization ,COMMA has sold over <NUM> farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average ,COMMA but this didn't happen overnight .PERIOD 
and so we needed grants .PERIOD and he used significant grants to research ,COMMA to experiment ,COMMA to fail ,COMMA to innovate and try again .PERIOD 
and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers ,COMMA that's when patient capital could come in .PERIOD 
and we helped him build a company ,COMMA for profit ,COMMA that would build on ide's knowledge ,COMMA and start looking at sales and exports ,COMMA and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .PERIOD 
and so we met dr .PERIOD sono khangharani in pakistan .PERIOD 
and while ,COMMA again ,COMMA you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan ,COMMA just to get the permits ,COMMA over time we were able to start a company with dr .PERIOD sono ,COMMA who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert ,COMMA which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .PERIOD 
and though that company has just started ,COMMA our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions .PERIOD 
but drip irrigation isn't the only innovation .PERIOD 
we're starting to see these happening all around the world .PERIOD 
and they produce <NUM> million lifesaving bednets for africans around the world .PERIOD 
lifespring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality ,COMMA affordable maternal health care to low-income women ,COMMA and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every <NUM> days .PERIOD 
and <NUM> ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry ,COMMA building an ambulance service in bombay that would use the technology of google earth ,COMMA a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access ,COMMA and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption .PERIOD 
they've just won four government contracts to build off their <NUM> ambulances ,COMMA and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in india .PERIOD 
this idea of scale is critical .PERIOD 
because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people .PERIOD all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people .PERIOD 
but that's obviously not enough .PERIOD 
and it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important .PERIOD 
whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets ,COMMA government itself ,COMMA or partner with major corporations ,COMMA there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation .PERIOD 
he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country ,COMMA and look at how we can scale it .PERIOD 
and i would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations ,COMMA not only for their country ,COMMA but ones that we can use in the developed world as well .PERIOD 
invest financial assistance ,COMMA but also management assistance .PERIOD 
and then measure the returns ,COMMA both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective .PERIOD 
when we think about new approaches to aid ,COMMA it's impossible not to talk about pakistan .PERIOD 
we've had a rocky relationship with that country and ,COMMA in all fairness ,COMMA the united states has not always been a very reliable partner .PERIOD 
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .PERIOD 
and if we take that notion of a global innovation fund ,COMMA we could use this time to invest not directly in government ,COMMA though we would have government's blessing ,COMMA nor in international experts ,COMMA but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country .PERIOD 
people like rashani zafar ,COMMA who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country ,COMMA and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country .PERIOD 
and tasneem siddiqui ,COMMA who developed a way called incremental housing ,COMMA where he has moved <NUM> slum dwellers into safe ,COMMA affordable community housing .PERIOD 
educational initiatives like dil and the citizen foundation that are building schools across the country .PERIOD 
i've invested in pakistan for over seven years now ,COMMA and those of you who've also worked there can attest that pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population ,COMMA and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature .PERIOD 
president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable .PERIOD 
i would say that the converse is true .PERIOD 
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the <NUM> percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day ,COMMA provide real pathways to hope .PERIOD 
and as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan ,COMMA while we need to strengthen the judiciary ,COMMA build greater stability ,COMMA we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world .PERIOD 
on one of my last visits to pakistan ,COMMA i asked dr .PERIOD sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the thar desert .PERIOD 
and we left karachi one morning before dawn .PERIOD 
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color ,COMMA lots of heat ,COMMA very little discussion ,COMMA because we were exhausted .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA at the end of the journey ,COMMA i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon .PERIOD 
and as we got closer ,COMMA its significance became apparent .PERIOD 
that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall .PERIOD 
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life .PERIOD 
his name was raja ,COMMA and he had kind ,COMMA twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father .PERIOD 
and he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his <NUM> children and <NUM> grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about <NUM> cents a day .PERIOD 
because he was building these crops .PERIOD 
and with the money he earned he could stay this year .PERIOD 
and for the first time ever in three generations ,COMMA his children would go to school .PERIOD 
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA of course i will .PERIOD 
because i don't want them discriminated against anymore .PERIOD 
when we think about solutions to poverty ,COMMA we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity .PERIOD 
because at the end of the day ,COMMA dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth .PERIOD 
and what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .PERIOD 
because that is where dignity really starts .PERIOD 
martin luther king said that love without power is anemic and sentimental ,COMMA and that power without love is reckless and abusive .PERIOD 
our generation has seen both approaches tried ,COMMA and often fail .PERIOD 
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power .PERIOD 
for that is what we'll need ,COMMA as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us ,COMMA and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet .PERIOD 
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions ,COMMA a cross sector ,COMMA is now .PERIOD 
i can only talk from my own experience ,COMMA but in eight years of running acumen fund ,COMMA i've seen the power of patient capital .PERIOD 
not only to inspire innovation and risk taking ,COMMA but to truly build systems that have created more than <NUM> jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet .PERIOD 
i know it works .PERIOD 
but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work .PERIOD 
and so i urge you ,COMMA in whatever sector you work ,COMMA in whatever job you do ,COMMA to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help .PERIOD 
rather than what we think that they might need .PERIOD 
it will take embracing the world with both arms .PERIOD 
and it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability ,COMMA with a sense of integrity and perseverance .PERIOD 
and yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations .PERIOD 
and there is so much good that we can do .PERIOD 
just think of all those sunflowers in the desert .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
over the past couple of days as i've been preparing for my speech ,COMMA i've become more and more nervous about what i'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people .PERIOD 
being on the same stage as al gore ,COMMA who was the first person i ever voted for .PERIOD 
and -- so i was getting pretty nervous and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i didn't know that chris sits on the stage ,COMMA and that's more nerve wracking .PERIOD 
but then i started thinking about my family .PERIOD 
i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather ,COMMA and i realized that i had all of these teds going through my blood stream -- -- that i had to consider this my element .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA who am i ?QUESTIONMARK 
chris kind of mentioned i started a company with my husband .PERIOD 
we have about <NUM> people internationally .PERIOD 
if you looked in the book ,COMMA you saw this ,COMMA which i really was appalled by .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA besides this freakish thing ,COMMA this is my science slide .PERIOD this is math ,COMMA and this is science ;SEMICOLON this is genetics .PERIOD 
this is my grandmother ,COMMA and this is where i get this mouth .PERIOD 
i'm a blogger ,COMMA which ,COMMA probably to a lot of you ,COMMA means different things .PERIOD 
you may have heard about the kryptonite lock brouhaha ,COMMA where a blogger talked about how you hack ,COMMA or break into ,COMMA a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen ,COMMA and it spread all over .PERIOD kryptonite had to adjust the lock ,COMMA and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns .PERIOD 
you may have heard about rathergate ,COMMA which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the th in <NUM> is not typesetted on an old typewriter ;SEMICOLON it's on word .PERIOD 
bloggers exposed this ,COMMA or they worked hard to expose this .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA blogs are scary .PERIOD this is what you see .PERIOD 
i see this ,COMMA and i'm sure scared -- and i swear on stage -- shitless about blogs ,COMMA because this is not something that's friendly .PERIOD 
but there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA these are great examples .PERIOD these people are reaching thousands ,COMMA if not millions ,COMMA of readers ,COMMA and that's incredibly important .PERIOD 
you have my friend ,COMMA who has a blog on digital -- on pdrs ,COMMA personal recorders .PERIOD 
he makes enough money ,COMMA just by running ads ,COMMA to support his family up in oregon .PERIOD 
that's all he does now ,COMMA and this is something that blogs have made possible .PERIOD 
and then you have something like this ,COMMA which is interplast .PERIOD 
it's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it .PERIOD 
children with cleft palates will get it ,COMMA and they document their story .PERIOD this is wonderful .PERIOD 
i am not that caring .PERIOD 
i talk about myself .PERIOD that's what i am .PERIOD i'm a blogger .PERIOD 
i have always decided that i was going to be an expert on one thing ,COMMA and i am an expert on this person ,COMMA and so i write about it .PERIOD 
and -- the short story about my blog :COLON it started in <NUM> .PERIOD i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
i wasn't happy with my job ,COMMA because i was a designer ,COMMA but i wasn't being really stimulated .PERIOD 
i was an english major in college .PERIOD i didn't have any use for it ,COMMA but i missed writing .PERIOD so ,COMMA i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories .PERIOD 
this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was <NUM> years old ,COMMA and how i went to a ymca camp -- christian camp -- and basically by the end ,COMMA i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk .PERIOD they couldn't find me .PERIOD 
you can laugh ,COMMA this is ok .PERIOD 
this is me .PERIOD 
this is what happened to me .PERIOD 
and when i started my blog it was really this one goal -- i said ,COMMA i am not going to be famous to the world ,COMMA but i could be famous to people on the internet .PERIOD 
and i set a goal .PERIOD i said ,COMMA i'm going to win an award ,COMMA because i had never won an award in my entire life .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA i'm going to win this award -- the south by southwest weblog award .PERIOD 
i wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $300 banjo ,COMMA which is a lot of money ,COMMA and i don't play instruments ;SEMICOLON i don't know anything about music .PERIOD 
i like music ,COMMA and i like banjos ,COMMA and i think i probably heard steve martin playing ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA i could do that .PERIOD 
and i said to my husband ,COMMA i said ,COMMA ben ,COMMA can i buy a banjo ?QUESTIONMARK and he's like ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
you're just like your dad ,COMMA who collects instruments .PERIOD 
and i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him ;SEMICOLON he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo .PERIOD 
this is mena ,COMMA this is how i make a joke at people .PERIOD 
because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant :COLON this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog .PERIOD 
and if he knew i was showing this right now -- i put this in today -- he would kill me .PERIOD 
but the thing was ,COMMA i wrote this ,COMMA and my friends read it ,COMMA and they're like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that mena ,COMMA she wrote a post about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wanting a stupid thing and being stupid .PERIOD 
but i got emails from people that said ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA your husband is such an asshole .PERIOD 
you could take that money and buy your banjo .PERIOD 
why don't you open a separate account ?QUESTIONMARK 
i've been with him since i was <NUM> years old .PERIOD we've never had a separate bank account .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA separate your bank account -- spend your money ;SEMICOLON spend his money .PERIOD that's it .PERIOD 
and -- i was like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what ,COMMA who are these people ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i realized :COLON i don't want to reach these people .PERIOD 
i don't want to write for this public audience .PERIOD 
and i started to kill my blog slowly .PERIOD 
i'm like ,COMMA i don't want to write this anymore ,COMMA and i slowly and slowly -- and i did tell personal stories from time to then .PERIOD 
i wrote this one ,COMMA and i put this up because of einstein today .PERIOD 
and i'm going to get choked up ,COMMA because this is my first pet ,COMMA and she passed away two years ago .PERIOD 
and i decided to break from ,COMMA i don't really write about my public life ,COMMA because i wanted to give her a little memorial .PERIOD 
but anyways .PERIOD 
it's these sort of personal stories .PERIOD you know ,COMMA you read the blogs about politics ,COMMA or about media ,COMMA and gossip and all these things .PERIOD 
these are out there ,COMMA but it's more of the personal that interests me ,COMMA and this is -- this is who i am .PERIOD 
you see norman rockwell .PERIOD and you have art critics say ,COMMA norman rockwell is not art .PERIOD 
norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms ,COMMA and this is not something to be considered high art .PERIOD 
and i think this is one of the most important things to us as humans .PERIOD 
these things resonate with us ,COMMA and ,COMMA if you think about blogs ,COMMA you think of high art blogs ,COMMA the history paintings about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA all biblical stories ,COMMA and then you have this .PERIOD 
these are the blogs that interest me :COLON the people who just tell stories .PERIOD 
one story is about this baby ,COMMA and his name is odin .PERIOD 
his father was a blogger .PERIOD 
and he was writing his blog one day ,COMMA and his wife gave birth to her baby at <NUM> weeks .PERIOD 
and he never expected this .PERIOD 
one day it was normal ;SEMICOLON the next day it was hell .PERIOD 
and this is a one-pound baby .PERIOD 
so odin was documented every single day .PERIOD 
pictures were taken every day :COLON day one ,COMMA day two . .PERIOD 
you have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea ;SEMICOLON day <NUM> -- he gets pneumonia .PERIOD 
his baby is so small ,COMMA and i've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image ,COMMA but just -- just so heartfelt .PERIOD 
you're reading this as this happens ,COMMA so on day <NUM> ,COMMA everybody reads that he's having failures :COLON breathing failures and heart failures ,COMMA and it's slowing down ,COMMA and you don't know what to expect .PERIOD 
but then it gets better .PERIOD day <NUM> he goes home .PERIOD 
and you see this post .PERIOD 
that's not something that you're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels ,COMMA and people are excited about it .PERIOD 
twenty-eight comments .PERIOD that's not a huge amount of people reading ,COMMA but <NUM> people matter .PERIOD 
and today he is a healthy baby ,COMMA who ,COMMA if you read his blog -- it's snowdealorg ,COMMA his father's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still ,COMMA because he is still his son and he is ,COMMA i think ,COMMA at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA blogs .PERIOD 
so what ?QUESTIONMARK you've probably heard these things before .PERIOD 
we talked about the well ,COMMA and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history .PERIOD 
but i think blogs are basically just an evolution ,COMMA and that's where we are today .PERIOD 
it's this record of who you are ,COMMA your persona .PERIOD 
you have your google search where you say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA what is mena trott ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy .PERIOD 
but then you also find people's blogs ,COMMA and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic ,COMMA but things that interest them .PERIOD 
and we talk about the world flattens as being this panel ,COMMA and i am very optimistic .PERIOD 
whenever i think about blogs i'm like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we've got to reach all these people .PERIOD 
millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA we're getting into china ,COMMA we want to be there ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA there are so many people who won't have the access to write a blog .PERIOD 
but to see something like the $100 computer is amazing ,COMMA because it's a -- blogging software is simple .PERIOD 
we have a successful company because of timing ,COMMA and because of perseverance ,COMMA but it's simple stuff -- it's not rocket science .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA that's an amazing thing to consider .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the life record of a blog is something that i find incredibly important .PERIOD 
we started with a slide of my teds ,COMMA and i had to add this slide ,COMMA because i knew that the minute i showed this ,COMMA my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow ,COMMA because she does read my blog -- and she'll say ,COMMA why wasn't there a picture of me ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is my mom .PERIOD so ,COMMA i have all of the people that i know of .PERIOD 
but this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line .PERIOD 
i showed a norman rockwell painting before ,COMMA and this one i grew up with ,COMMA looking at constantly .PERIOD 
i would spend hours looking at just the connections ,COMMA saying ,COMMA oh ,COMMA the little kid up at the top has red hair ;SEMICOLON so does that first generation up there .PERIOD 
and just these little things .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that has always influenced me .PERIOD 
i have this record ,COMMA this <NUM> census of another grabowski -- that's my maiden name -- and there's a theodore ,COMMA because there's always a theodore .PERIOD 
this is all i have .PERIOD i have a couple of facts about somebody .PERIOD 
i have their date of birth ,COMMA and their age ,COMMA and what they did in their household ,COMMA if they spoke english ,COMMA and that's it .PERIOD that's all i know of these people .PERIOD 
and it's pretty sad ,COMMA because i only go back five generations ,COMMA and then it's it .PERIOD i don't even know what happens on my mom's side ,COMMA because she's from cuba and i don't have that many things .PERIOD 
and just doing this i spent time in the archives -- that's another thing why my husband's a saint -- i spent time in the washington archives ,COMMA just sitting there ,COMMA looking for these things .PERIOD now it's online ,COMMA but he sat through that .PERIOD 
and so you have this record and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is my great-great-grandmother .PERIOD 
another photo that has greatly influenced me ,COMMA or a series of photos ,COMMA is this project that's done by an argentinean man and his wife .PERIOD 
and he's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past ,COMMA what is '<NUM> -- <NUM> ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA i'm '<NUM> -- <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK twenty-nine years .PERIOD 
there was a joke ,COMMA originally ,COMMA about my graph that i left out ,COMMA which is :COLON you see all this math ?QUESTIONMARK i'm just happy i was able to add it up to <NUM> ,COMMA because that's my skill set .PERIOD 
so you have these people aging ,COMMA and now this is them today ,COMMA or last year ,COMMA and that's a powerful thing to have ,COMMA to be able to track this .PERIOD 
i wish that i would have this of my family .PERIOD 
i know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren ,COMMA or my great-grandchildren ,COMMA if i ever have children -- what i am going to -- who i was ,COMMA so i do something that's very narcissistic :COLON i am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me ,COMMA because it captures a moment in time everyday .PERIOD 
i take a picture of myself -- i've been doing this since last year -- every single day .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's the same picture ;SEMICOLON it's basically the same person .PERIOD 
only a couple of people read it .PERIOD i don't write this for this audience ;SEMICOLON i'm showing it now ,COMMA but i would go insane if this was really public .PERIOD 
about four people probably read it ,COMMA and they tell me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you haven't updated -- i'm probably going to get people telling me i haven't updated -- but this is something that's amazing ,COMMA because i can go back to a day -- i can go back to april <NUM> ,COMMA and say ,COMMA what was i doing this day ?QUESTIONMARK i look at it ,COMMA i know exactly .PERIOD 
it's this visual cue that is so important to what we do .PERIOD 
i put the bad pictures up too ,COMMA because there are bad pictures .PERIOD 
and i remember instantly :COLON i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-day trip .PERIOD 
i was sick ,COMMA and i was in a hotel room ,COMMA and i wanted not to be there .PERIOD and so you see these things .PERIOD 
it's not just always smiling .PERIOD now i've kind of evolved it ,COMMA so i have this look .PERIOD 
if you look at my driver's license i have the same look ,COMMA and it's -- it's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it's something that is really important .PERIOD 
and the last story i really want to tell is this story ,COMMA because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what i'm doing .PERIOD 
and i'll probably get choked up ,COMMA because i tend to when i talk about this .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this woman ,COMMA her name was emma ,COMMA and she was a blogger on our service ,COMMA typepad .PERIOD and she was a beta tester ,COMMA so she was there right when we opened -- you know ,COMMA there were <NUM> people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer .PERIOD 
she was writing and writing and writing ,COMMA and we all started reading it ,COMMA because we had so few blogs on the service ,COMMA we could keep track of everyone .PERIOD 
and she was writing one day ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA then she disappeared for a little bit .PERIOD 
and her sister came on ,COMMA and she said that emma had passed away .PERIOD and all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional ,COMMA and it was a very hard day at the company .PERIOD 
and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship ,COMMA and flattening this sort of world .PERIOD 
that this woman is in england ,COMMA and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing .PERIOD 
but the big thing that really influenced us was ,COMMA her sister wrote to me ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and she wrote on this blog ,COMMA that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her ,COMMA and being able to talk to people ,COMMA being able to share what was going on ,COMMA and being able to write and receive comments .PERIOD 
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that ,COMMA and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing ,COMMA and that the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary ,COMMA that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs ,COMMA that we can be people who are open ,COMMA and wanting to help and talk to people .PERIOD 
that was an amazing thing .PERIOD 
and that's a huge thing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is her legacy ,COMMA and i think that my call to action to all of you is :COLON you know ,COMMA think about blogs ,COMMA think about what they are ,COMMA think about what you've thought of them ,COMMA and then actually do it ,COMMA because it's something that is really going to change our lives .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
i've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty ,COMMA form and function of giant bluefin tuna .PERIOD 
bluefin are warmblooded like us .PERIOD 
they're the largest of the tunas ,COMMA the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish .PERIOD 
they actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal .PERIOD 
that's one of our bluefin at the monterey bay aquarium .PERIOD 
it's actually got a naked skin for most of its body ,COMMA so it reduces friction with the water .PERIOD 
this is what one of nature's finest machines .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA bluefin were revered by man for all of human history .PERIOD 
for <NUM> years ,COMMA we fished sustainably for this animal ,COMMA and it's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago .PERIOD 
bluefin are in cave paintings in france .PERIOD 
they're on coins that date back <NUM> years .PERIOD 
this fish was revered by humankind .PERIOD 
it was fished sustainably till all of time ,COMMA except for our generation .PERIOD 
bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on earth ,COMMA and this is a gold rush for bluefin .PERIOD 
there are traps that fish sustainably up until recently .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA the type of fishing going on today ,COMMA with pens ,COMMA with enormous stakes ,COMMA is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet .PERIOD 
now bluefin ,COMMA in general ,COMMA goes to one place :COLON japan .PERIOD 
some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin .PERIOD 
they're delectable muscle ,COMMA rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious .PERIOD 
and that's their problem ;SEMICOLON we're eating them to death .PERIOD 
now in the atlantic ,COMMA the story is pretty simple .PERIOD 
bluefin have two populations :COLON one large ,COMMA one small .PERIOD 
the north american population is fished at about <NUM> ton .PERIOD 
the european population and north african -- the eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels :COLON <NUM> tons over the last decade almost every year .PERIOD 
the result is whether you're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population ,COMMA there's been tremendous decline on both sides ,COMMA as much as <NUM> percent if you go back with your baseline to <NUM> .PERIOD 
for that ,COMMA bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers ,COMMA to lions ,COMMA to certain african elephants and to pandas .PERIOD 
these fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months .PERIOD 
they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago ,COMMA despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of cites i .PERIOD 
and if it's tunas you don't care about ,COMMA perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks ,COMMA sharks ,COMMA marlin ,COMMA albatross .PERIOD 
these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries .PERIOD 
the challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna ,COMMA and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an african lion takes down its prey .PERIOD 
i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed .PERIOD 
it's the 21st century ,COMMA but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way .PERIOD 
technology has come of age that's allowing us to see the earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely .PERIOD 
and we've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works .PERIOD 
most of us from the ship -- even i -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea .PERIOD 
we don't know where the structure is .PERIOD 
we can't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an african plain .PERIOD 
we can't see the corridors ,COMMA and we can't see what it is that brings together a tuna ,COMMA a leatherback and an albatross .PERIOD 
we're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot .PERIOD 
the reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea .PERIOD 
it's hard to study a bluefin on its turf ,COMMA the entire pacific realm .PERIOD 
it's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it .PERIOD 
and then imagine being bruce mate's team from osu ,COMMA getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays ,COMMA an engineering challenge we've yet to really overcome .PERIOD 
so the story of our team ,COMMA a dedicated team ,COMMA is fish and chips .PERIOD 
we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts ,COMMA or the same parts that are in your computer ,COMMA chips .PERIOD 
we're putting them together in unusual ways ,COMMA and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before .PERIOD 
and for the first time ,COMMA we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i've been working with tunas for over <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i have the privilege of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium .PERIOD 
we've actually taken a sliver of the ocean ,COMMA put it behind glass ,COMMA and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display .PERIOD 
when the veil of bubbles lifts every morning ,COMMA we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean ,COMMA one of the only places on earth you can see giant bluefin swim by .PERIOD 
we can see in their beauty of form and function ,COMMA their ceaseless activity .PERIOD 
they're flying through their space ,COMMA ocean space .PERIOD 
and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty .PERIOD 
behind the scenes is a working lab at stanford university partnered with the monterey bay aquarium .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA for over <NUM> or <NUM> years ,COMMA we've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity .PERIOD 
we'd been studying these fish ,COMMA but first we had to learn how to husbandry them .PERIOD 
what do they like to eat ?QUESTIONMARK 
what is it that they're happy with ?QUESTIONMARK 
we go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing .PERIOD it feels wonderful .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA better yet ,COMMA we've got our own version of tuna whisperers ,COMMA our own chuck farwell ,COMMA alex norton ,COMMA who can take a big tuna and in one motion ,COMMA put it into an envelope of water ,COMMA so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea .PERIOD 
jeff and jason there ,COMMA are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill ,COMMA a flume .PERIOD 
and that tuna thinks it's going to japan ,COMMA but it's staying in place .PERIOD 
we're actually measuring its oxygen consumption ,COMMA its energy consumption .PERIOD 
we're taking this data and building better models .PERIOD 
and when i see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- i begin to wonder :COLON how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's the closest you'll probably ever get .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .PERIOD 
we've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas .PERIOD 
we've actually tagged <NUM> tunas .PERIOD 
and i'm going to show you three clips ,COMMA because i tagged <NUM> tunas .PERIOD 
it's a very hard process ,COMMA but it's a ballet .PERIOD 
we bring the tuna out ,COMMA we measure it .PERIOD 
a team of fishers ,COMMA captains ,COMMA scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes .PERIOD 
we put water over its gills ,COMMA give it oxygen .PERIOD 
and then with a lot of effort ,COMMA after tagging ,COMMA putting in the computer ,COMMA making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment ,COMMA we send this fish back into the sea .PERIOD 
and when it goes ,COMMA we're always happy .PERIOD 
we see a flick of the tail .PERIOD 
and from our data that gets collected ,COMMA when that tag comes back ,COMMA because a fisher returns it for a thousand-dollar reward ,COMMA we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now ,COMMA on a backboned animal .PERIOD 
now sometimes the tunas are really large ,COMMA such as this fish off nantucket .PERIOD 
but that's about half the size of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged .PERIOD 
it takes a human effort ,COMMA a team effort ,COMMA to bring the fish in .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA what we're going to do is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna .PERIOD 
this tag rides on the tuna ,COMMA senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish ,COMMA detach ,COMMA float to the surface and send back to earth-orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag ,COMMA pressure data and temperature data .PERIOD 
and so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag .PERIOD 
both the electronic tags i'm talking about are expensive .PERIOD 
these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america .PERIOD 
they are some of our finest instruments ,COMMA our new technology in the ocean today .PERIOD 
one community in general has given more to help us than any other community .PERIOD 
there are two villages ,COMMA harris and morehead city ,COMMA every winter for over a decade ,COMMA held a party called tag-a-giant ,COMMA and together ,COMMA fishers worked with us to tag <NUM> to <NUM> fish .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA we're actually going to measure the fish .PERIOD 
we're going to do something that in recent years we've started :COLON take a mucus sample .PERIOD 
watch how shiny the skin is ;SEMICOLON you can see my reflection there .PERIOD 
and from that mucus ,COMMA we can get gene profiles ,COMMA we can get information on gender ,COMMA checking the pop-up tag one more time ,COMMA and then it's out in the ocean .PERIOD 
and this is my favorite .PERIOD 
with the help of my former postdoc ,COMMA gareth lawson ,COMMA this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna .PERIOD 
this tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean .PERIOD 
the warm is the gulf stream ,COMMA the cold up there in the gulf of maine .PERIOD 
that's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there .PERIOD it's too cold .PERIOD 
but then it warms up ,COMMA and the tuna pops in ,COMMA gets some fish ,COMMA maybe comes back to home base ,COMMA goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas .PERIOD 
and my favorite scene ,COMMA three tunas going into the gulf of mexico .PERIOD 
three tunas tagged .PERIOD 
astronomically ,COMMA we're calculating positions .PERIOD 
that is where the tuna spawn .PERIOD 
and now we're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side .PERIOD 
so two populations of tunas -- that is ,COMMA we have a gulf population ,COMMA one that we can tag -- they go to the gulf of mexico ,COMMA i showed you that -- and a second population .PERIOD 
living amongst our tunas -- our north american tunas -- are european tunas that go back to the med .PERIOD 
on the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they're mixed populations .PERIOD 
and so what we've done with the science is we're showing the international commission ,COMMA building new models ,COMMA showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model -- to this day ,COMMA used to reject the cites treaty -- that model isn't the right model .PERIOD 
this model ,COMMA a model of overlap ,COMMA is the way to move forward .PERIOD 
so we can then predict where management places should be .PERIOD 
places like the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean are places where the single species ,COMMA the single population ,COMMA can be captured .PERIOD 
these become forthright in places we need to protect .PERIOD 
the center of the atlantic where the mixing is ,COMMA i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish ,COMMA because they manage their fisheries well ,COMMA they're doing a good job .PERIOD 
but in the international realm ,COMMA where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild ,COMMA these are the places that we have to make hope spots in .PERIOD 
that's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna .PERIOD 
now in a second project called tagging of pacific pelagics ,COMMA we took on the planet as a team ,COMMA those of us in the census of marine life .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA funded primarily through sloan foundation and others ,COMMA we were able to actually go in ,COMMA in our project -- we're one of <NUM> field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators ,COMMA not just tunas .PERIOD 
so what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska ,COMMA met salmon shark on their home territory ,COMMA followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that ,COMMA if we take a salmon and put it on a line ,COMMA we can actually take up a salmon shark -- this is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note ,COMMA i say very carefully ,COMMA -- we can actually keep it calm ,COMMA put a hose in its mouth ,COMMA keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag .PERIOD 
that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message .PERIOD 
and that shark leaping there ,COMMA if you look carefully ,COMMA has an antenna .PERIOD 
it's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon ,COMMA sending home its data .PERIOD 
salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag .PERIOD 
but there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer .PERIOD 
now right next door in monterey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson -- there -- and sal jorgensen .PERIOD 
they can throw out a target -- it's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark ,COMMA a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft .PERIOD boat .PERIOD 
it's a several thousand-pound animal .PERIOD 
and we'll wind in the target .PERIOD 
and we'll place an acoustic tag that says ,COMMA omshark <NUM> ,COMMA or something like that ,COMMA acoustically with a ping .PERIOD 
and then we'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long-distance journeys with the light-based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that's on the fish .PERIOD 
so in this case ,COMMA sal's looking at two tags there ,COMMA and there they are :COLON the white sharks of california going off to the white shark cafe and coming back .PERIOD 
we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues ,COMMA blue sharks .PERIOD 
and now ,COMMA together ,COMMA what we can see on this ocean of color that's temperature ,COMMA we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks .PERIOD 
we have white sharks and blue sharks .PERIOD 
for the first time ,COMMA an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale ,COMMA showing where the sharks go .PERIOD 
the tuna team from topp has done the unthinkable :COLON three teams tagged <NUM> tunas ,COMMA bluefin ,COMMA yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out ,COMMA pick up juvenile tunas ,COMMA put in the tags that actually have the sensors ,COMMA stick out the tuna and then let them go .PERIOD 
they get returned ,COMMA and when they get returned ,COMMA here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor ,COMMA returning to the western pacific .PERIOD 
our team from ucsc has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads ,COMMA that come off when they slough .PERIOD 
these elephant seals cover half an ocean ,COMMA take data down to <NUM> feet -- amazing data .PERIOD 
and then there's scott shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags ,COMMA light-based tags ,COMMA that now are going to take you from new zealand to monterey and back ,COMMA journeys of <NUM> nautical miles we had never seen before .PERIOD 
but now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small ,COMMA we can actually see these journeys .PERIOD 
same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes ,COMMA up to the same zone the tunas use .PERIOD 
you can see why they might be caught .PERIOD 
then there's george schillinger and our leatherback team out of playa grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are .PERIOD 
and scott benson's team that showed that leatherbacks go from indonesia all the way to monterey .PERIOD 
so what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are .PERIOD 
we can actually see how they're using ecospaces as large as an ocean .PERIOD 
and from this information ,COMMA we can begin to map the hope spots .PERIOD 
so this is just three years of data right here -- and there's a decade of this data .PERIOD 
we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on .PERIOD 
so what we're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots ,COMMA <NUM> deployments ,COMMA a huge herculean task ,COMMA <NUM> tags in an area ,COMMA shown here for the first time ,COMMA off the california coast ,COMMA that appears to be a gathering place .PERIOD 
and then for sort of an encore from these animals ,COMMA they're helping us .PERIOD 
they're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to <NUM> meters .PERIOD 
they're taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles .PERIOD 
those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles .PERIOD 
this data ,COMMA when visualized ,COMMA is captivating to watch .PERIOD 
we still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues ,COMMA we also think it's critical to get this information to the public ,COMMA to engage the public with this kind of data .PERIOD 
we did this with the great turtle race -- tagged turtles ,COMMA brought in four million hits .PERIOD 
and now with google's oceans ,COMMA we can actually put a white shark in that ocean .PERIOD 
and when we do and it swims ,COMMA we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii .PERIOD 
but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can't see .PERIOD 
we've got the capacity ,COMMA nasa has the ocean .PERIOD 
so in conclusion ,COMMA we know where yellowstone is for north america ;SEMICOLON it's off our coast .PERIOD 
what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity .PERIOD 
how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks .PERIOD 
make killer apps ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge .PERIOD 
let's connect the public to this activity right on their iphone .PERIOD 
that way we do away with a few internet myths .PERIOD 
so we can save the bluefin tuna .PERIOD 
we can save the white shark .PERIOD 
we have the science and technology .PERIOD 
hope is here .PERIOD yes we can .PERIOD 
we need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and usually when i tell people i'm an artist ,COMMA they just look at me and say ,COMMA do you paint ?QUESTIONMARK 
or what kind of medium do you work in ?QUESTIONMARK 
well most of my work that i work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique .PERIOD 
so what i'm really interested in is creative problem solving .PERIOD 
and i had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .PERIOD 
so let me show you a little of that .PERIOD 
so it started over here .PERIOD 
and this is the detroit airport in june 19th of <NUM> .PERIOD 
i was flying back to the us .PERIOD from an exhibition overseas .PERIOD 
and as i was coming back ,COMMA well i was taken by the fbi ,COMMA met by an fbi agent ,COMMA and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- where were you ?QUESTIONMARK what were you doing ?QUESTIONMARK who were you talking with ?QUESTIONMARK 
why were you there ?QUESTIONMARK who pays for your trips ?QUESTIONMARK -- all these little details .PERIOD 
and then literally just out of nowhere ,COMMA the guy asks me ,COMMA where were you september 12th ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when most of us get asked ,COMMA where were you september 12th ?QUESTIONMARK 
or any date for that fact ,COMMA it's like ,COMMA i don't exactly remember ,COMMA but i can look it up for you .PERIOD 
so i pulled out my little pda ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's look up my appointments for september 12th .PERIOD 
i had september 12th -- from <NUM> am .PERIOD to <NUM> am ,COMMA i paid my storage bill .PERIOD 
from <NUM> am .PERIOD to <NUM> pm ,COMMA i met with judith who was one of my graduate students at the time .PERIOD 
from <NUM> pm .PERIOD to <NUM> pm ,COMMA i taught my intro class ,COMMA <NUM> pm .PERIOD to <NUM> pm ,COMMA i taught my advanced class .PERIOD 
where were you the 11th ?QUESTIONMARK where were you the 10th ?QUESTIONMARK 
where were you the 29th ?QUESTIONMARK the 30th ?QUESTIONMARK 
where were you october 5th ?QUESTIONMARK 
we read about six months of my calendar .PERIOD 
and i don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what i did .PERIOD 
but good thing i did ,COMMA because i don't look good in orange .PERIOD 
so he asked me -- so this storage unit that you paid the rent on ,COMMA what did you have in it ?QUESTIONMARK 
this was in tampa ,COMMA florida ,COMMA so i was like ,COMMA winter clothes that i have no use for in florida .PERIOD 
furniture that i can't fit in my ratty apartment .PERIOD 
just assorted garage sale junk ,COMMA because i'm a pack rat .PERIOD 
and he looks at me really confused and says ,COMMA no explosives ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was like ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i'm pretty certain there were no explosives .PERIOD 
and if there were ,COMMA i would have remembered that one .PERIOD 
and he's still a little confused ,COMMA but i think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes i'm not exactly a terrorist threat .PERIOD 
and so we're sitting there ,COMMA and eventually after about an hour ,COMMA hour and a half of just going back and forth ,COMMA he says ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i have enough information here .PERIOD 
i'm going to pass this onto the tampa office .PERIOD they're the ones who initiated this .PERIOD 
they'll follow up with you ,COMMA and we'll take care of it .PERIOD 
i was like ,COMMA great .PERIOD 
so i got home and the phone rings ,COMMA and a man introduced himself .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA you folks know that in the united states ,COMMA you can't take photographs of federal buildings ,COMMA but google can do it for you .PERIOD 
so to the folks from google ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
so i spent a lot of time in this building .PERIOD 
questions like :COLON have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the united states or a foreign nation ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you also have to consider the state of mind you're in when you're doing this .PERIOD 
you're basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .PERIOD 
well the first one was ,COMMA is your name hasan ?QUESTIONMARK yes .PERIOD 
are we in florida ?QUESTIONMARK yes .PERIOD is today tuesday ?QUESTIONMARK yes .PERIOD 
because you have to base it on a yes or no .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next question is :COLON do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states ?QUESTIONMARK 
i work at a university .PERIOD 
so i was like ,COMMA maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly .PERIOD 
but they said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA aside from what we had discussed ,COMMA do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states ?QUESTIONMARK 
i was like ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
so at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs ,COMMA they said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA everything's fine .PERIOD 
i was like ,COMMA i know .PERIOD that's what i've been trying to tell you guys all along .PERIOD 
i know everything's fine .PERIOD 
so they're looking at me really odd .PERIOD 
this is with the fbi .PERIOD 
and i was like ,COMMA all we need is alaska not to get the last memo ,COMMA and here we go all over again .PERIOD 
and there was a sincere concern there .PERIOD 
and he was like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you get into trouble ,COMMA give us a call -- we'll take care of it .PERIOD 
so ever since then ,COMMA before i would go anywhere ,COMMA i would call the fbi .PERIOD 
i would tell them ,COMMA hey guys ,COMMA this is where i'm going .PERIOD this is my flight .PERIOD 
northwest flight seven coming into seattle on march 12th or whatever .PERIOD 
a couple weeks later ,COMMA i'd call again ,COMMA let them know .PERIOD 
it wasn't that i had to ,COMMA but i chose to .PERIOD 
just wanted to say ,COMMA hey guys .PERIOD 
i don't want you guys to think that i'm about to flee .PERIOD 
just letting you know .PERIOD heads up .PERIOD 
and then the phone calls turned into emails ,COMMA and the emails got longer and longer and longer . .PERIOD 
with pictures ,COMMA with travel tips .PERIOD 
and then i built this over here .PERIOD let me go back to it over here .PERIOD 
so i actually designed this back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
so this kind of tracks me at any given moment .PERIOD 
i wrote some code for my mobile phone .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA what i decided is okay guys ,COMMA you want to watch me ,COMMA that's cool .PERIOD 
but i'll watch myself .PERIOD it's okay .PERIOD 
you don't have to waste your energy or your resources .PERIOD 
and i'll help you out .PERIOD 
so in the process ,COMMA i start thinking ,COMMA well what else might they know about me ?QUESTIONMARK 
well they probably have all my flight records ,COMMA so i decided to put all my flight records from birth online .PERIOD 
and then you see ,COMMA these are some of the meals that i've been fed on the planes .PERIOD 
see that ?QUESTIONMARK they won't let me on a plane with that ,COMMA but they'll give it to me on the plane .PERIOD 
that's kennedy airport ,COMMA may 19th ,COMMA tuesday .PERIOD 
this is in warsaw .PERIOD 
singapore .PERIOD you can see ,COMMA they're kind of empty .PERIOD 
these images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone .PERIOD 
and when you're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence ,COMMA you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner .PERIOD 
at the time that this was going on ,COMMA the last thing on my mind was art project .PERIOD 
i was certainly not thinking ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i got new work here .PERIOD 
but after going through this ,COMMA after realizing ,COMMA well what just happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
and after piecing together this ,COMMA this and this ,COMMA this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this ,COMMA and it actually became this project .PERIOD 
so these are the stores that i shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know .PERIOD 
this is me buying some duck flavored paste at the ranch <NUM> in daly city on sunday ,COMMA november 15th .PERIOD 
at coreana supermarket buying my kimchi because i like kimchi .PERIOD 
and i bought some crabs too right around there ,COMMA and some chitlins at the safeway in emoryville .PERIOD 
and laundry too .PERIOD laundry detergent at west oakland -- east oakland ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD 
and then my pickled jellyfish at the hong kong supermarket on route <NUM> in east brunswick .PERIOD 
now if you go to my bank records ,COMMA it'll actually show something from there ,COMMA so you know that ,COMMA on may 9th ,COMMA that i bought $1479 in fuel from safeway vallejo .PERIOD 
so not only that i'm giving this information here and there ,COMMA but now there's a third party ,COMMA an independent third party ,COMMA my bank ,COMMA that's verifying that ,COMMA yes indeed ,COMMA i was there at this time .PERIOD 
so there's points ,COMMA and these points are actually being cross-referenced .PERIOD 
and there's a verification taking place .PERIOD 
sometimes they're really small purchases .PERIOD 
so <NUM> cents foreign transaction fee .PERIOD 
all of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts ,COMMA and everything pops up right away .PERIOD 
sometimes there's a lot of information .PERIOD 
sometimes you just get this ,COMMA just an empty hallway in salt lake city ,COMMA january 22nd .PERIOD 
and i can tell you exactly who i was with ,COMMA where i was ,COMMA because this is what i had to do with the fbi .PERIOD 
i had to tell them every little detail of everything .PERIOD 
i spend a lot of time on the road .PERIOD 
this is a parking lot in elko ,COMMA nevada off of route <NUM> at <NUM> pm .PERIOD on august 19th .PERIOD 
i spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations .PERIOD 
and there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images .PERIOD 
there's actually <NUM> images right now on my site ,COMMA and the fbi has seen all of them -- at least i trust they've seen all of them .PERIOD 
and then sometimes you don't get much information at all ,COMMA you just get this empty bed .PERIOD 
and sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information .PERIOD 
so you get something like this .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in california -- vietnamese sandwich .PERIOD 
these are some of the meals that i've been cooking at home .PERIOD 
so how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?QUESTIONMARK 
well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times .PERIOD 
so again ,COMMA you have to do some detective work here .PERIOD 
so sometimes the databases get so specific .PERIOD 
these are all tacos eaten in mexico city near a train station on july fifth to july sixth .PERIOD 
at <NUM> am .PERIOD was this one .PERIOD 
so i time-stamp my life every few moments .PERIOD 
now it's all done on my iphone ,COMMA and it all goes straight up to my server ,COMMA and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .PERIOD 
they need to know where i'm doing my business ,COMMA because they want to know about my business .PERIOD 
so on december 4th ,COMMA i went here .PERIOD 
and on sunday ,COMMA june 14th at <NUM> -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in skowhegan ,COMMA maine -- this was my apartment there .PERIOD 
so what you're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information .PERIOD 
if you go to my site ,COMMA there's tons of things .PERIOD 
and really ,COMMA it's not the most user-friendly interface .PERIOD 
it's actually quite user-unfriendly .PERIOD 
and one of the reasons ,COMMA also being part of the user-unfriendliness ,COMMA is that everything is there ,COMMA but you have to really work through it .PERIOD 
but in this barrage of noise that i'm putting out ,COMMA i actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life .PERIOD 
and you know very little about me actually .PERIOD 
and really so i've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy ,COMMA particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded ,COMMA there's no need to delete information anymore .PERIOD 
so what do you do when everything is out there ?QUESTIONMARK 
well you have to take control over it .PERIOD 
and if i give you this information directly ,COMMA it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces .PERIOD 
the other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information ,COMMA or restricted access to information .PERIOD 
and i understand that ,COMMA on an individual level ,COMMA it's purely symbolic .PERIOD 
but if <NUM> million people in the us .PERIOD 
started doing this ,COMMA we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up .PERIOD 
because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything .PERIOD 
and we're getting to that .PERIOD 
when i first started this project ,COMMA people were looking at me and saying ,COMMA why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing ,COMMA where you're at ?QUESTIONMARK 
why are you posting these photos ?QUESTIONMARK 
this was an age before people were tweeting everywhere and <NUM> million people were posting status messages or poking people .PERIOD 
i'm still doing this project ,COMMA but it is obsolete ,COMMA because you're all doing it .PERIOD 
this is something that we all are doing on a daily basis ,COMMA whether we're aware of it or not .PERIOD 
so we're creating our own archives and so on .PERIOD 
because no one's really watching .PERIOD 
no one's really going to bother you .PERIOD 
so one of the things that i do is i actually look through my server logs very carefully .PERIOD 
because it's about surveillance .PERIOD 
i'm watching who's watching me .PERIOD 
and i came up with these .PERIOD 
so these are some of my sample logs .PERIOD 
and just little bits and pieces ,COMMA and you can see some of the things there .PERIOD 
and i cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .PERIOD 
you can see the national security agency likes to come by .PERIOD 
i actually moved very close to them .PERIOD i live right down the street from them now .PERIOD 
central intelligence agency .PERIOD 
executive office of the president .PERIOD 
not really sure why they show up ,COMMA but they do .PERIOD 
i think they kind of like to look at art .PERIOD 
and i'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .PERIOD 
so thank you very much .PERIOD i appreciate it .PERIOD 
you said ,COMMA now everything automatically goes from my iphone ,COMMA but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .PERIOD 
so how many hours of the day does that take ?QUESTIONMARK 
almost none .PERIOD 
it's no different than sending a text .PERIOD 
it's no different than checking an email .PERIOD 
it's one of those things ,COMMA we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA when we update a status message ,COMMA we don't really think about how long that's going to take .PERIOD 
so it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks ,COMMA send ,COMMA and then it's done .PERIOD 
so it holds onto the very last point .PERIOD 
so if i'm on a 12-hour flight ,COMMA you'll see the last airport that i departed from .PERIOD 
i think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the french revolution .PERIOD 
what's changed is we now can look at the evidence ,COMMA we can compare societies ,COMMA more and less equal societies ,COMMA and see what inequality does .PERIOD 
i'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links i'm going to be showing you exist .PERIOD 
i want to start though with a paradox .PERIOD 
this shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average .PERIOD 
and you see the countries on the right ,COMMA like norway and the usa ,COMMA are twice as rich as israel ,COMMA greece ,COMMA portugal on the left .PERIOD 
and it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .PERIOD 
there's no suggestion of a relationship there .PERIOD 
but if we look within our societies ,COMMA there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA again ,COMMA is life expectancy .PERIOD 
these are small areas of england and wales -- the poorest on the right ,COMMA the richest on the left .PERIOD 
a lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us .PERIOD 
so income means something very important within our societies ,COMMA and nothing between them .PERIOD 
the explanation of that paradox is that ,COMMA within our societies ,COMMA we're looking at relative income or social position ,COMMA social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .PERIOD 
and as soon as you've got that idea ,COMMA you should immediately wonder :COLON what happens if we widen the differences ,COMMA or compress them ,COMMA make the income differences bigger or smaller ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that's what i'm going to show you .PERIOD 
i'm not using any hypothetical data .PERIOD 
i'm taking data from the un .PERIOD -- it's the same as the world bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies .PERIOD 
the measure we've used ,COMMA because it's easy to understand and you can download it ,COMMA is how much richer the top <NUM> percent than the bottom <NUM> percent in each country .PERIOD 
and you see in the more equal countries on the left -- japan ,COMMA finland ,COMMA norway ,COMMA sweden -- the top <NUM> percent are about three and a half ,COMMA four times as rich as the bottom <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
but on the more unequal end -- uk ,COMMA portugal ,COMMA usa ,COMMA singapore -- the differences are twice as big .PERIOD 
on that measure ,COMMA we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies .PERIOD 
now i'm going to show you what that does to our societies .PERIOD 
we collected data on problems with social gradients ,COMMA the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .PERIOD 
internationally comparable data on life expectancy ,COMMA on kids' maths and literacy scores ,COMMA on infant mortality rates ,COMMA homicide rates ,COMMA proportion of the population in prison ,COMMA teenage birthrates ,COMMA levels of trust ,COMMA obesity ,COMMA mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility .PERIOD 
we put them all in one index .PERIOD 
they're all weighted equally .PERIOD 
where a country is is a sort of average score on these things .PERIOD 
the more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems .PERIOD 
it's an extraordinarily close correlation .PERIOD 
but if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to gnp per capita ,COMMA gross national income ,COMMA there's nothing there ,COMMA no correlation anymore .PERIOD 
we were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence ,COMMA so we also did a paper in the british medical journal on the unicef index of child well-being .PERIOD 
it has <NUM> different components put together by other people .PERIOD 
it contains whether kids can talk to their parents ,COMMA whether they have books at home ,COMMA what immunization rates are like ,COMMA whether there's bullying at school .PERIOD 
everything goes into it .PERIOD 
here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality .PERIOD 
kids do worse in the more unequal societies .PERIOD 
highly significant relationship .PERIOD 
but once again ,COMMA if you look at that measure of child well-being ,COMMA in relation to national income per person ,COMMA there's no relationship ,COMMA no suggestion of a relationship .PERIOD 
what all the data i've shown you so far says is the same thing .PERIOD 
the average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth .PERIOD 
but the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much .PERIOD 
i'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA is trust .PERIOD 
it's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted .PERIOD 
it comes from the world values survey .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA at the more unequal end ,COMMA it's about <NUM> percent of the population who feel they can trust others .PERIOD 
and if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital ,COMMA very similar relationships closely related to inequality .PERIOD 
i may say ,COMMA we did all this work twice .PERIOD 
we did it first on these rich ,COMMA developed countries ,COMMA and then as a separate test bed ,COMMA we repeated it all on the <NUM> american states -- asking just the same question :COLON do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ?QUESTIONMARK 
so here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality .PERIOD 
very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust .PERIOD 
same thing is going on .PERIOD 
basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the <NUM> states in that separate test bed .PERIOD 
we're not just talking about a fluke .PERIOD 
this is mental illness .PERIOD 
who put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society .PERIOD 
this is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year .PERIOD 
and it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA closely related to inequality .PERIOD 
these red dots are american states ,COMMA and the blue triangles are canadian provinces .PERIOD 
but look at the scale of the differences .PERIOD 
it goes from <NUM> homicides per million up to <NUM> .PERIOD 
this is the proportion of the population in prison .PERIOD 
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .PERIOD 
in some places ,COMMA that's part of it .PERIOD 
but most of it is about more punitive sentencing ,COMMA harsher sentencing .PERIOD 
and the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty .PERIOD 
here we have children dropping out of high school .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA quite big differences .PERIOD 
extraordinarily damaging ,COMMA if you're talking about using the talents of the population .PERIOD 
this is social mobility .PERIOD 
it's actually a measure of mobility based on income .PERIOD 
and at the more unequal end ,COMMA fathers' income is much more important -- in the uk ,COMMA usa .PERIOD 
and in scandinavian countries ,COMMA fathers' income is much less important .PERIOD 
there's more social mobility .PERIOD 
and as we like to say -- and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here -- if americans want to live the american dream ,COMMA they should go to denmark .PERIOD 
i've shown you just a few things in italics here .PERIOD 
i could have shown a number of other problems .PERIOD 
they're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient .PERIOD 
but there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse ,COMMA but anything from twice as common to <NUM> times as common .PERIOD 
think of the expense ,COMMA the human cost of that .PERIOD 
i want to go back though to this graph that i showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points .PERIOD 
so what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality .PERIOD 
the other really important point i want to make on this graph is that ,COMMA if you look at the bottom ,COMMA sweden and japan ,COMMA they're very different countries in all sorts of ways .PERIOD 
the position of women ,COMMA how closely they keep to the nuclear family ,COMMA are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world .PERIOD 
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .PERIOD 
sweden has huge differences in earnings ,COMMA and it narrows the gap through taxation ,COMMA general welfare state ,COMMA generous benefits and so on .PERIOD 
japan is rather different though .PERIOD 
it starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax .PERIOD 
it has lower taxes .PERIOD 
it has a smaller welfare state .PERIOD 
and in our analysis of the american states ,COMMA we find rather the same contrast .PERIOD 
there are some states that do well through redistribution ,COMMA some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax .PERIOD 
so we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality ,COMMA as long as you get there somehow .PERIOD 
another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality .PERIOD 
there seems to be some truth in john donne's no man is an island .PERIOD 
and in a number of studies ,COMMA it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy .PERIOD 
this is just one example .PERIOD 
it's infant mortality .PERIOD 
some swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the british register of general socioeconomic classification .PERIOD 
and so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations ,COMMA so single parents go on their own .PERIOD 
but then where it says low social class ,COMMA that's unskilled manual occupations .PERIOD 
it goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle ,COMMA then the junior non-manual ,COMMA going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors ,COMMA lawyers ,COMMA directors of larger companies .PERIOD 
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .PERIOD 
the biggest differences are at the bottom of society .PERIOD 
but even at the top ,COMMA there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society .PERIOD 
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally .PERIOD 
and that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom ,COMMA but has some benefits even at the top .PERIOD 
but i should say a few words about what's going on .PERIOD 
i think i'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .PERIOD 
more to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority ,COMMA of being valued and devalued ,COMMA respected and disrespected .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society .PERIOD 
we worry more about how we're judged and seen by others ,COMMA whether we're regarded as attractive ,COMMA clever ,COMMA all that kind of thing .PERIOD 
the social-evaluative judgments increase ,COMMA the fear of those social-evaluative judgments .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA some parallel work going on in social psychology :COLON some people reviewed <NUM> different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones ,COMMA their responses to doing stressful tasks ,COMMA measured .PERIOD 
and in the review ,COMMA what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol ,COMMA the central stress hormone .PERIOD 
and the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance .PERIOD 
those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress .PERIOD 
now we have been criticized .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising .PERIOD 
i should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data ,COMMA we never pick and choose data .PERIOD 
we have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at ,COMMA it goes into the analysis .PERIOD 
our data source decides whether it's reliable data ,COMMA we don't .PERIOD 
otherwise that would introduce bias .PERIOD 
what about other countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are <NUM> studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .PERIOD 
this isn't confined to these countries here ,COMMA hiding a very simple demonstration .PERIOD 
the same countries ,COMMA the same measure of inequality ,COMMA one problem after another .PERIOD 
why don't we control for other factors ?QUESTIONMARK 
well we've shown you that gnp per capita doesn't make any difference .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .PERIOD 
what about causality ?QUESTIONMARK 
correlation in itself doesn't prove causality .PERIOD 
we spend a good bit of time .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .PERIOD 
or for instance ,COMMA the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .PERIOD 
i should say that to deal with this ,COMMA we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things .PERIOD 
we've got to constrain income ,COMMA the bonus culture incomes at the top .PERIOD 
i think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can .PERIOD 
i think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us .PERIOD 
suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies ,COMMA and that's exciting .PERIOD 
the new me is beauty .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA people used to say ,COMMA norman's ok ,COMMA but if you followed what he said ,COMMA everything would be usable but it would be ugly .PERIOD 
this is neat .PERIOD 
thank you for setting up my display .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it's just wonderful .PERIOD 
and i haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for ,COMMA but i want it .PERIOD 
and that's my new life .PERIOD 
my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about ,COMMA and pretty ,COMMA and emotions .PERIOD 
the new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun .PERIOD 
and so this is a philippe starck juicer ,COMMA produced by alessi .PERIOD 
it's just neat ;SEMICOLON it's fun .PERIOD it's so much fun i have it in my house -- but i have it in the entryway ,COMMA i don't use it to make juice .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i bought the gold-plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says ,COMMA don't use this juicer to make juice .PERIOD 
so actually ,COMMA i took a carton of orange juice and i poured it in the glass to take this picture .PERIOD 
it's a global cutting knife made in japan .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at .PERIOD 
second of all ,COMMA it's really beautifully balanced :COLON it holds well ,COMMA it feels well .PERIOD 
and third of all ,COMMA it's so sharp ,COMMA it just cuts .PERIOD 
it's a delight to use .PERIOD 
and so it's got everything ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's beautiful and it's functional .PERIOD 
and i can tell you stories about it ,COMMA which makes it reflective ,COMMA and so you'll see i have a theory of emotion .PERIOD 
and those are the three components .PERIOD 
hiroshi ishii and his group at the mit media lab took a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it ,COMMA and on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it .PERIOD 
and as you play ping-pong ,COMMA whenever the ball hits part of the table ,COMMA the ripples spread out and the fish run away .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA then the ball hits the other side ,COMMA the ripples hit the -- poor fish ,COMMA they can't find any peace and quiet .PERIOD 
is that a good way to play ping-pong ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK yeah .PERIOD 
or look at google .PERIOD 
if you type in ,COMMA oh say ,COMMA emotion and design ,COMMA you get <NUM> pages of results .PERIOD 
so google just took their logo and they spread it out .PERIOD 
instead of saying ,COMMA you got <NUM> results .PERIOD 
this is one through <NUM> .PERIOD next ,COMMA they just give you as many o's as there are pages .PERIOD 
it's really simple and subtle .PERIOD 
i bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it .PERIOD 
that's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you didn't know why .PERIOD 
and it's just clever .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA what's especially good is ,COMMA if you type design and emotion ,COMMA the first response out of those <NUM> pages is my website .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the weird thing is google lies ,COMMA because if i type design and emotion ,COMMA it says ,COMMA you don't need the 'and' we do it anyway .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
it was third .PERIOD 
oh well ,COMMA different story .PERIOD 
there was this wonderful review in the new york times about the mini cooper automobile .PERIOD 
it said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is a car that has lots of faults .PERIOD 
buy it anyway .PERIOD 
and if you look at the inside of the car -- i mean ,COMMA i loved it ,COMMA i wanted to see it ,COMMA i rented it ,COMMA this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car ,COMMA the whole design is fun .PERIOD 
it's round ,COMMA it's neat .PERIOD 
the controls work wonderfully .PERIOD 
so that's my new life ;SEMICOLON it's all about fun .PERIOD 
i really have the feeling that pleasant things work better ,COMMA and that never made any sense to me until i finally figured out -- look . .PERIOD 
i'm going to put a plank on the ground .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and <NUM> feet long and i'm going to walk on it ,COMMA and you see i can walk on it without looking ,COMMA i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down .PERIOD 
no problem .PERIOD 
now i'm going to put the plank <NUM> feet in the air -- and i'm not going to go near it ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
intense fear paralyzes you .PERIOD 
it actually affects the way the brain works .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA paul saffo ,COMMA before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk ,COMMA and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus .PERIOD 
that's what fear and anxiety does ;SEMICOLON it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus ,COMMA not be distracted .PERIOD 
and i couldn't force myself across that .PERIOD 
now some people can -- circus workers ,COMMA steel workers .PERIOD 
but it really changes the way you think .PERIOD 
she brought students in to solve problems .PERIOD 
it was an empty room ,COMMA except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff .PERIOD 
and she'd bring them in ,COMMA and she'd say ,COMMA this is an iq test and it determines how well you do in life .PERIOD 
would you tie those two strings together ?QUESTIONMARK 
so they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string .PERIOD 
still can't reach it .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA basically ,COMMA none of them could solve it .PERIOD 
you bring in a second group of people ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA before we start ,COMMA i got this box of candy ,COMMA and i don't eat candy .PERIOD 
would you like the box of candy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and turns out they liked it ,COMMA and it made them happy -- not very happy ,COMMA but a little bit of happy .PERIOD 
and guess what -- they solved the problem .PERIOD 
and it turns out that when you're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain ,COMMA which focuses you makes you depth-first .PERIOD 
and when you're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes ,COMMA which makes you a breadth-first problem solver :COLON you're more susceptible to interruption ;SEMICOLON you do out-of-the-box thinking .PERIOD 
that's what brainstorming is about ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
with brainstorming we make you happy ,COMMA we play games ,COMMA and we say ,COMMA no criticism ,COMMA and you get all these weird ,COMMA neat ideas .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done because you'd be working along and say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i got a new way of doing it .PERIOD 
so to get work done ,COMMA you've got to set a deadline ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
you've got be anxious .PERIOD 
the brain works differently if you're happy .PERIOD things work better because you're more creative .PERIOD 
no big deal .PERIOD 
there's something i call the visceral level of processing ,COMMA and there will be visceral-level design .PERIOD 
biology -- we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors .PERIOD 
that's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants ,COMMA because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed .PERIOD 
we dislike bitter tastes ,COMMA we dislike loud sounds ,COMMA we dislike hot temperatures ,COMMA cold temperatures .PERIOD 
we dislike scolding voices .PERIOD we dislike frowning faces ;SEMICOLON we like symmetrical faces ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
so that's the visceral level .PERIOD 
in design ,COMMA you can express visceral in lots of ways ,COMMA like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot ,COMMA exciting .PERIOD 
or the <NUM> jaguar :COLON it's actually a crummy car ,COMMA falls apart all the time ,COMMA but the owners love it .PERIOD 
and it's beautiful -- it's in the museum of modern art .PERIOD 
a water bottle :COLON you buy it because of the bottle ,COMMA not because of the water .PERIOD 
and when people are finished ,COMMA they don't throw it away .PERIOD 
they keep it for -- you know ,COMMA it's like the old wine bottles ,COMMA you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again ,COMMA which proves it's not the water .PERIOD 
it's all about the visceral experience .PERIOD 
the middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done .PERIOD 
visceral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it .PERIOD 
i'm walking around the stage -- i'm not attending to the control of my legs .PERIOD 
i'm doing a lot ;SEMICOLON most of my talk is subconscious ;SEMICOLON it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot .PERIOD 
most of what we do is subconscious .PERIOD 
automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious ,COMMA controlled by the behavioral side .PERIOD 
and behavioral design is all about feeling in control ,COMMA which includes usability ,COMMA understanding -- but also the feel and heft .PERIOD 
that's why the global knives are so neat .PERIOD 
they're so nicely balanced ,COMMA so sharp ,COMMA that you really feel you're in control of the cutting .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA just driving a high-performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again ,COMMA feeling that you are in complete control of the environment .PERIOD 
or the sensual feeling .PERIOD 
this is a kohler shower ,COMMA a waterfall shower ,COMMA and actually ,COMMA all those knobs beneath are also showerheads .PERIOD 
it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA because it recirculates the same dirty water .PERIOD 
or this -- this is a really neat teapot i found at high tea at the four seasons hotel in chicago .PERIOD 
it's a ronnefeldt tilting teapot .PERIOD 
that's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back ,COMMA and you put tea in ,COMMA and then you fill it with water .PERIOD 
the water then seeps over the tea .PERIOD 
there's a little ledge inside ,COMMA so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that .PERIOD 
and when the tea is ready ,COMMA or almost ready ,COMMA you tilt it .PERIOD 
and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing .PERIOD 
and when it's finished ,COMMA you put it vertically ,COMMA and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out .PERIOD 
on top of that ,COMMA it communicates ,COMMA which is what emotion does .PERIOD 
emotion is all about acting ;SEMICOLON emotion is really about acting .PERIOD 
it's being safe in the world .PERIOD 
cognition is about understanding the world ,COMMA emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good ,COMMA bad ,COMMA safe ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA and getting us ready to act ,COMMA which is why the muscles tense or relax .PERIOD 
and that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting ,COMMA subconsciously ,COMMA except that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA this has emotions if you like ,COMMA because it signals the waiter that ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i'm finished .PERIOD see -- upright .PERIOD 
and the waiter can come by and say ,COMMA would you like more water ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's kind of neat .PERIOD what a wonderful design .PERIOD 
and the third level is reflective ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if you like the superego ,COMMA it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do ,COMMA no control over the -- doesn't see the senses ,COMMA doesn't control the muscles .PERIOD 
it looks over what's going on .PERIOD 
it's that little voice in your head that's watching and saying ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD that's bad .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA why are you doing that ?QUESTIONMARK i don't understand .PERIOD 
it's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness .PERIOD 
here's a great reflective product .PERIOD 
owners of the hummer have said ,COMMA you know i've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars ,COMMA but never have i had a car that attracted so much attention .PERIOD 
it's about attention .PERIOD it's about their image ,COMMA not about the car .PERIOD 
if you want a more positive model -- this is the gm car .PERIOD 
and you'll buy it to protect the environment ,COMMA even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected .PERIOD 
but that's reflective design as well .PERIOD 
or an expensive watch ,COMMA so you can impress people -- oh gee ,COMMA i didn't know you had that watch .PERIOD 
as opposed to this one ,COMMA which is a pure behavioral watch ,COMMA which probably keeps better time than the $13000 watch i just showed you .PERIOD 
but it's ugly .PERIOD 
this is a clear don norman watch .PERIOD 
and what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other ,COMMA the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying ,COMMA it's ok .PERIOD it's ok .PERIOD it's safe .PERIOD it's safe .PERIOD 
if that amusement park were rusty and falling apart ,COMMA you'd never go on the ride .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's pitting one against the other .PERIOD 
so jake cress is this furniture maker ,COMMA and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture .PERIOD 
and this is his chair with claw ,COMMA and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it's trying to get it back before anybody notices .PERIOD 
and what's so neat about it is how you accept that story .PERIOD 
and that's what's nice about emotion .PERIOD 
i'm only saying positive things from now on .PERIOD 
i have a tough job to do .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA when i looked at the profile of the audience here ,COMMA with their connotations and design ,COMMA in all its forms ,COMMA and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA that i wanted to tell you ,COMMA i wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context .PERIOD 
in order to do that in <NUM> minutes ,COMMA i have to bring out four ideas -- it's like four pieces of a puzzle .PERIOD 
and if i succeed in doing that ,COMMA maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on ,COMMA and perhaps help me do my work .PERIOD 
the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA by remoteness ,COMMA i mean two or three different kinds of things .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA remoteness in its normal sense ,COMMA which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center ,COMMA you get to remoter areas .PERIOD 
what happens to education ?QUESTIONMARK 
the second ,COMMA or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world ,COMMA you have pockets ,COMMA like slums ,COMMA or shantytowns ,COMMA or poorer areas ,COMMA which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city ,COMMA so it's us and them .PERIOD 
what happens to education in that context ?QUESTIONMARK 
so keep both of those ideas of remoteness .PERIOD 
we made a guess .PERIOD the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers .PERIOD 
if they do have ,COMMA they cannot retain those teachers .PERIOD 
they do not have good enough infrastructure .PERIOD 
and if they had some infrastructure ,COMMA they have difficulty maintaining it .PERIOD 
but i wanted to check if this is true .PERIOD so what i did last year was we hired a car ,COMMA looked up on google ,COMMA found a route into northern india from new delhi which ,COMMA you know ,COMMA which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers .PERIOD drove out about <NUM> kilometers ,COMMA and wherever we found a school ,COMMA administered a set of standard tests ,COMMA and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA this is a very small sample ;SEMICOLON you should not generalize from it .PERIOD 
but it was quite obvious ,COMMA quite clear ,COMMA that for this particular route that i had taken ,COMMA the remoter the school was ,COMMA the worse its results seemed to be .PERIOD 
that seemed a little damning ,COMMA and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure ,COMMA or with the availability of electricity ,COMMA and things like that .PERIOD 
to my surprise ,COMMA it did not correlate .PERIOD 
it did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure .PERIOD 
it did not correlate with the poverty levels .PERIOD it did not correlate .PERIOD 
but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools ,COMMA with one single question for the teachers -- which was ,COMMA would you like to move to an urban ,COMMA metropolitan area ?QUESTIONMARK -- <NUM> percent of them said yes .PERIOD and as you can see from that ,COMMA they say yes just a little bit out of delhi ,COMMA and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi -- because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA those are relatively better off areas -- and then from <NUM> kilometers out of delhi ,COMMA the answer is consistently yes .PERIOD 
i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that ,COMMA i wish i was in some other school ,COMMA probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results .PERIOD 
so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools ,COMMA as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat ,COMMA and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing .PERIOD it appears that way .PERIOD 
when you take education and technology ,COMMA then i find in the literature that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA things like websites ,COMMA collaborative environments -- you've been listening to all that in the morning -- it's always piloted first in the best schools ,COMMA the best urban schools ,COMMA and ,COMMA according to me ,COMMA biases the result .PERIOD 
the literature -- one part of it ,COMMA the scientific literature -- consistently blames et as being over-hyped and under-performing .PERIOD 
the teachers always say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's fine ,COMMA but it's too expensive for what it does .PERIOD 
because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA <NUM> percent of whatever they could do .PERIOD 
you put in this new super-duper technology ,COMMA and now they get <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
so the principal looks at it and says ,COMMA <NUM> percent for <NUM> dollars ?QUESTIONMARK forget it .PERIOD 
so the relative change that et ,COMMA educational technology ,COMMA would make ,COMMA would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top ,COMMA but we seem to be doing it the other way about .PERIOD 
so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged first ,COMMA not the other way about .PERIOD 
and finally came the question of ,COMMA how do you tackle teacher perception ?QUESTIONMARK 
whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology ,COMMA the teacher's first reaction is ,COMMA you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible .PERIOD 
i don't know why it's impossible ,COMMA but ,COMMA even for a moment ,COMMA if you did assume that it's impossible -- i have a quotation from sir arthur c .PERIOD clarke ,COMMA the science fiction writer whom i met in colombo ,COMMA and he said something which completely solves this problem .PERIOD 
he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine ,COMMA should be .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it puts the teacher into a tough bind ,COMMA you have to think .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA so i'm proposing that an alternative primary education ,COMMA whatever alternative you want ,COMMA is required where schools don't exist ,COMMA where schools are not good enough ,COMMA where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough ,COMMA for whatever reason .PERIOD 
if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies ,COMMA then you don't need an alternative education .PERIOD 
so far i haven't come across such an area ,COMMA except for one case .PERIOD i won't name the area ,COMMA but somewhere in the world people said ,COMMA we don't have this problem ,COMMA because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools .PERIOD 
there are such areas ,COMMA but -- anyway ,COMMA i'd never heard that anywhere else .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about children and self-organization ,COMMA and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .PERIOD 
they're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments .PERIOD 
i'll have to really rush through this .PERIOD they're a set of experiments .PERIOD 
the first one was done in new delhi in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and what we did over there was pretty much simple .PERIOD 
i had an office in those days which bordered a slum ,COMMA an urban slum ,COMMA so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum .PERIOD 
they cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall -- and put a pretty powerful pc into that hole ,COMMA sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end ,COMMA a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall ,COMMA put it on high-speed internet ,COMMA put the internet explorer there ,COMMA put it on altavistacom -- in those days -- and just left it there .PERIOD 
and this is what we saw .PERIOD 
so that was my office in iit .PERIOD here's the hole-in-the-wall .PERIOD 
about eight hours later ,COMMA we found this kid .PERIOD 
to the right is this eight-year-old child who -- and to his left is a six-year-old girl ,COMMA who is not very tall .PERIOD 
and what he was doing was ,COMMA he was teaching her to browse .PERIOD 
so it sort of raised more questions than it answered .PERIOD 
is this real ?QUESTIONMARK does the language matter ,COMMA because he's not supposed to know english ?QUESTIONMARK 
will the computer last ,COMMA or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it ,COMMA this time in a city called shivpuri in the center of india ,COMMA where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything .PERIOD 
so it was a warm day ,COMMA and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building .PERIOD this is the first kid who came there ;SEMICOLON he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout .PERIOD 
very quickly ,COMMA he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me ,COMMA i have never seen a television where you can do something .PERIOD 
so he figured that out .PERIOD it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA as he was doing that ,COMMA he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that .PERIOD 
he did that ,COMMA and the internet explorer changed page .PERIOD 
eight minutes later ,COMMA he looked from his hand to the screen ,COMMA and he was browsing :COLON he was going back and forth .PERIOD 
when that happened ,COMMA he started calling all the neighborhood children ,COMMA like ,COMMA children would come and see what's happening over here .PERIOD 
and by the evening of that day ,COMMA <NUM> children were all browsing .PERIOD 
so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there .PERIOD 
so we thought that this is what was happening :COLON that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the internet .PERIOD but under what circumstances ?QUESTIONMARK 
at this time there was a -- the main question was about english .PERIOD 
people said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you really ought to have this in indian languages .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA have what ,COMMA shall i translate the internet into some indian language ?QUESTIONMARK that's not possible .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it has to be the other way about .PERIOD 
but let's see ,COMMA how do the children tackle the english language ?QUESTIONMARK 
i took the experiment out to northeastern india ,COMMA to a village called madantusi ,COMMA where ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA there was no english teacher ,COMMA so the children had not learned english at all .PERIOD 
and i built a similar hole-in-the-wall .PERIOD 
one big difference in the villages ,COMMA as opposed to the urban slums :COLON there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk .PERIOD 
in the urban slums ,COMMA the girls tend to stay away .PERIOD 
so when i came back there ,COMMA i found these two kids ,COMMA eight- and 12-year-olds ,COMMA who were playing a game on the computer .PERIOD 
i was real surprised .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA how on earth did they know all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA we've picked it up from the cds .PERIOD 
so they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you've left this machine which talks only in english ,COMMA so we had to learn english .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier ;SEMICOLON in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA i got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable ,COMMA if they happen everywhere else .PERIOD 
india is a good place to do such an experiment in ,COMMA because we have all the ethnic diversities ,COMMA all the -- you know ,COMMA the genetic diversity ,COMMA all the racial diversities ,COMMA and also all the socio-economic diversities .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world .PERIOD 
so i did this for almost five years ,COMMA and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india .PERIOD 
i also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors ,COMMA and i was using regular ,COMMA normal pcs ,COMMA so i needed different climates ,COMMA for which india is also great ,COMMA because we have very cold ,COMMA very hot ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
this is the desert to the west .PERIOD near the pakistan border .PERIOD 
and you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet .PERIOD 
then to central india -- very warm ,COMMA moist ,COMMA fishing villages ,COMMA where humidity is a very big killer of electronics .PERIOD 
so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power ,COMMA so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running .PERIOD 
this sequence is also nice .PERIOD this is a small child ,COMMA a six-year-old ,COMMA telling his eldest sister what to do .PERIOD 
and this happens very often with these computers ,COMMA that the younger children are found teaching the older ones .PERIOD 
what did we find ?QUESTIONMARK we found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment ,COMMA irrespective of anything that we could measure .PERIOD 
i couldn't find a single correlation with anything ,COMMA but it had to be in groups .PERIOD 
and that may be of great ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interest to this group ,COMMA because all of you are talking about groups .PERIOD 
so here was the power of what a group of children can do ,COMMA if you lift the adult intervention .PERIOD 
just a quick idea of the measurements .PERIOD 
we took standard statistical techniques ,COMMA so i'm going to not talk about that .PERIOD 
what could they learn to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
basic windows functions ,COMMA browsing ,COMMA painting ,COMMA chatting and email ,COMMA games and educational material ,COMMA music downloads ,COMMA playing video .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA what all of us do .PERIOD 
and over <NUM> children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how do they do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
if you calculated the actual time of access ,COMMA it would work out to minutes per day ,COMMA so that's not how it's happening .PERIOD 
what you have ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is there is one child operating the computer .PERIOD 
and surrounding him are usually three other children ,COMMA who are advising him on what they should do .PERIOD 
if you test them ,COMMA all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them .PERIOD 
around these four are usually a group of about <NUM> children ,COMMA who are also advising ,COMMA usually wrongly ,COMMA about everything that's going on on the computer .PERIOD 
and all of them also will clear a test given on that subject .PERIOD 
so they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing .PERIOD 
it seems counter-intuitive to adult learning ,COMMA but remember ,COMMA eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told ,COMMA don't do this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA don't touch the whiskey bottle .PERIOD 
so what does the eight-year-old do ?QUESTIONMARK 
he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched .PERIOD 
and if you tested him ,COMMA he would answer every question correctly on that topic .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA they seem to be able to acquire very quickly .PERIOD 
so what was the conclusion over the six years of work ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was that primary education can happen on its own ,COMMA or parts of it can happen on its own .PERIOD 
it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards .PERIOD 
it could perhaps be a self-organizing system ,COMMA so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you ,COMMA that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective .PERIOD 
the third piece was on values ,COMMA and again ,COMMA to put it very briefly ,COMMA i conducted a test over <NUM> children spread across all over india ,COMMA and asked them -- i gave them about <NUM> different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions .PERIOD 
we got all sorts of opinions .PERIOD yes ,COMMA no or i don't know .PERIOD 
i simply took those questions where i got <NUM> percent yeses and <NUM> percent noes -- so i was able to get a collection of <NUM> such statements .PERIOD 
these were areas where the children were clearly confused ,COMMA because half said yes and half said no .PERIOD 
a typical example being ,COMMA sometimes it is necessary to tell lies .PERIOD 
they don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question ;SEMICOLON perhaps none of us do .PERIOD 
so i leave you with this third question .PERIOD 
can technology alter the acquisition of values ?QUESTIONMARK 
finally ,COMMA self-organizing systems ,COMMA about which ,COMMA again ,COMMA i won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it .PERIOD 
natural systems are all self-organizing :COLON galaxies ,COMMA molecules ,COMMA cells ,COMMA organisms ,COMMA societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .PERIOD 
but at this point in time ,COMMA as far as science goes ,COMMA it's self-organization .PERIOD 
but other examples are traffic jams ,COMMA stock market ,COMMA society and disaster recovery ,COMMA terrorism and insurgency .PERIOD 
and you know about the internet-based self-organizing systems .PERIOD 
so here are my four sentences then .PERIOD 
remoteness affects the quality of education .PERIOD 
educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first ,COMMA and other areas later .PERIOD 
values are acquired ;SEMICOLON doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms .PERIOD 
and learning is most likely a self-organizing system .PERIOD 
if you put all the four together ,COMMA then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal ,COMMA a vision ,COMMA for educational technology .PERIOD 
as educationists ,COMMA we have never asked for technology ;SEMICOLON we keep borrowing it .PERIOD 
powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology ,COMMA but it was not meant for education ,COMMA it was meant for making boardroom presentations .PERIOD 
we borrowed it .PERIOD video conferencing .PERIOD the personal computer itself .PERIOD 
i think it's time that the educationists made their own specs ,COMMA and i have such a set of specs .PERIOD this is a brief look at that .PERIOD 
and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness ,COMMA values and violence .PERIOD 
so i thought i'd give it a name -- why don't we call it outdoctrination .PERIOD 
and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i want to leave that as a thought with you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
my story is a little bit about war .PERIOD 
it's about disillusionment .PERIOD 
it's about death .PERIOD 
and perhaps also ,COMMA there's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed-up ,COMMA fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century .PERIOD 
i don't believe in straightforward narratives .PERIOD 
i don't believe in a life or history written as decision a led to consequence b led to consequence c -- these neat narratives that we're presented with ,COMMA and that perhaps we encourage in each other .PERIOD 
i believe in randomness ,COMMA and one of the reasons i believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random .PERIOD 
i'm colorblind .PERIOD 
i was born unable to see most colors .PERIOD 
this is why i wear gray and black most of the time ,COMMA and i have to take my wife with me to chose clothes .PERIOD 
and i'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when i was a boy .PERIOD 
i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside .PERIOD 
and it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot .PERIOD 
and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot ,COMMA and sure enough ,COMMA i failed .PERIOD 
i couldn't see all the blinking different lights ,COMMA and i can't distinguish color .PERIOD 
so i had to choose another career ,COMMA and this was in fact relatively easy for me ,COMMA because i had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood ,COMMA which was international relations .PERIOD 
as a child ,COMMA i read the newspaper thoroughly .PERIOD 
i was fascinated by the cold war ,COMMA by the inf negotiations over intermediate-range nuclear missiles ,COMMA the proxy war between the soviet union and the us .PERIOD 
in angola or afghanistan .PERIOD 
these things really interested me .PERIOD 
and so i decided quite at an early age i wanted to be a diplomat .PERIOD 
and i ,COMMA one day ,COMMA i announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- i said ,COMMA daddy ,COMMA i want to be a diplomat .PERIOD 
and he turned to me ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA carne ,COMMA you have to be very clever to be a diplomat .PERIOD 
and my ambition was sealed .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i entered the british foreign service .PERIOD 
that year ,COMMA <NUM> people applied to become a diplomat ,COMMA and <NUM> of us succeeded .PERIOD 
and as those numbers suggest ,COMMA i was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world .PERIOD 
being a diplomat ,COMMA then and now ,COMMA is an incredible job ,COMMA and i loved every minute of it -- i enjoyed the status of it .PERIOD 
i bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access i had to world events .PERIOD 
i traveled to the gaza strip .PERIOD 
i headed the middle east peace process section in the british foreign ministry .PERIOD 
i became a speechwriter for the british foreign secretary .PERIOD 
i met yasser arafat .PERIOD 
later ,COMMA i traveled to kabul and served in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban .PERIOD 
and i would travel in a c-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate al qaeda from afghanistan ,COMMA surrounded by my special forces escort ,COMMA who ,COMMA themselves ,COMMA had to have an escort of a platoon of royal marines ,COMMA because it was so dangerous .PERIOD 
and that was exciting -- that was fun .PERIOD 
it was really interesting .PERIOD 
and it's a great cadre of people ,COMMA incredibly close-knit community of people .PERIOD 
and the pinnacle of my career ,COMMA as it turned out ,COMMA was when i was posted to new york .PERIOD 
and my responsibility was the middle east ,COMMA which was my specialty .PERIOD 
i was the chief british negotiator on the subject ,COMMA and i was steeped in the issue .PERIOD 
and anyway ,COMMA my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .PERIOD 
i mean it was very dramatic diplomacy .PERIOD 
we went through several wars during my time in new york .PERIOD 
i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september <NUM> condemning the attacks of the day before ,COMMA which were ,COMMA of course ,COMMA deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .PERIOD 
so it was kind of the best of time ,COMMA worst of times kind of experience .PERIOD 
i lived the high-life .PERIOD 
although i worked very long hours ,COMMA i lived in a penthouse in union square .PERIOD 
i was a single british diplomat in new york city ;SEMICOLON you can imagine what that might have meant .PERIOD 
i had a good time .PERIOD 
but in <NUM> ,COMMA when my tour came to an end ,COMMA i decided i wasn't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london .PERIOD 
in some inchoate ,COMMA inarticulate way i realized that there was something wrong with my work ,COMMA with me .PERIOD 
i was exhausted ,COMMA and i was also disillusioned in a way i couldn't quite put my finger on .PERIOD 
and i decided to take some time out from work .PERIOD 
the foreign office was very generous .PERIOD 
you could take these special unpaid leave ,COMMA as they called them ,COMMA and yet remain part of the diplomatic service ,COMMA but not actually do any work .PERIOD 
it was nice .PERIOD 
and eventually ,COMMA i decided to take a secondment to join the un .PERIOD in kosovo ,COMMA which was then under un .PERIOD administration .PERIOD 
and two things happened in kosovo ,COMMA which kind of ,COMMA again ,COMMA shows the randomness of life ,COMMA because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage .PERIOD 
but they were random things .PERIOD 
one was that ,COMMA in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA the british government ,COMMA somewhat reluctantly ,COMMA decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on wmd in the run up to the iraq war ,COMMA a very limited subject .PERIOD 
and i testified to that inquiry in secret .PERIOD 
i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd ,COMMA and my testimony to the inquiry said three things :COLON that the government exaggerated the intelligence ,COMMA which was very clear in all the years i'd read it .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA our own internal assessment was very clear that iraq's wmd did not pose a threat to its neighbors ,COMMA let alone to us .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA the government had ignored all available alternatives to war ,COMMA which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still .PERIOD 
the third reason ,COMMA i won't go into .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA i gave that testimony ,COMMA and that presented me with a crisis .PERIOD 
what was i going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
this testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues ,COMMA of my ministers ,COMMA who had ,COMMA in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood .PERIOD 
and so i was in crisis .PERIOD 
and this wasn't a pretty thing .PERIOD 
i moaned about it ,COMMA i hesitated ,COMMA i went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife ,COMMA and eventually i decided to resign from the british foreign service .PERIOD 
i felt -- there's a scene in the al pacino movie the insider ,COMMA which you may know ,COMMA where he goes back to cbs after they've let him down over the tobacco guy ,COMMA and he goes ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i just can't do this anymore .PERIOD something's broken .PERIOD 
and it was like that for me .PERIOD i love that movie .PERIOD 
i felt just something's broken .PERIOD 
i can't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what i used to do gladly for them .PERIOD 
and it was a very ,COMMA very uncomfortable ,COMMA unpleasant feeling .PERIOD 
and i started to fall .PERIOD 
and today ,COMMA that fall hasn't stopped ;SEMICOLON i'm still falling .PERIOD 
and in a way ,COMMA i kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than i like actually standing on top of the cliff ,COMMA wondering what to do .PERIOD 
a second thing happened in kosovo ,COMMA which kind of -- i need a quick gulp of water ,COMMA forgive me .PERIOD 
a second thing happened in kosovo ,COMMA which kind of delivered the answer ,COMMA which i couldn't really answer ,COMMA which is ,COMMA what do i do with my life ?QUESTIONMARK 
i love diplomacy -- i have no career -- i expected my entire life to be a diplomat ,COMMA to be serving my country .PERIOD 
i wanted to be an ambassador ,COMMA and my mentors ,COMMA my heroes ,COMMA people who got to the top of my profession ,COMMA and here i was throwing it all away .PERIOD 
my pension was in it .PERIOD 
and i gave it up .PERIOD 
and what was i going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that year ,COMMA in kosovo ,COMMA this terrible ,COMMA terrible thing happened ,COMMA which i saw .PERIOD 
in march <NUM> ,COMMA there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of kosovo .PERIOD 
<NUM> people were killed .PERIOD 
and the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they've had enough burning and killing .PERIOD 
and that is not a very nice feeling to see ,COMMA and i saw it .PERIOD 
and i went through it .PERIOD i went through those mobs .PERIOD 
and with my albanian friends ,COMMA we tried to stop it ,COMMA but we failed .PERIOD 
and that riot taught me something ,COMMA which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story .PERIOD 
but one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots ,COMMA which went on for several days ,COMMA took place -- was because the kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future .PERIOD 
there were diplomatic negotiations about the future of kosovo going on then ,COMMA and the kosovo government ,COMMA let alone the kosovo people ,COMMA were not actually participating in those talks .PERIOD 
there was this whole fancy diplomatic system ,COMMA this negotiation process about the future of kosovo ,COMMA and the kosovars weren't part of it .PERIOD 
and funnily enough ,COMMA they were frustrated about that .PERIOD 
those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration .PERIOD 
it wasn't the only reason ,COMMA and life is not simple ,COMMA one reason narratives .PERIOD 
it was a complicated thing ,COMMA and i'm not pretending it was more simple than it was .PERIOD 
but that was one of the reasons .PERIOD 
and that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise ,COMMA it gave my wife the inspiration .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA why don't you advise the kosovars ?QUESTIONMARK 
why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .PERIOD 
they were not allowed diplomats .PERIOD 
and so that was the idea .PERIOD 
that was the origin of the thing that became independent diplomat ,COMMA the world's first diplomatic advisory group and a non-profit to boot .PERIOD 
and it began when i flew back from london after my time at the un .PERIOD in kosovo .PERIOD 
i flew back and had dinner with the kosovo prime minister and said to him ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm proposing that i come and advise you on the diplomacy .PERIOD 
i know this stuff .PERIOD it's what i do .PERIOD why don't i come and help you ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he raised his glass of raki to me and said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA carne .PERIOD come .PERIOD 
independent diplomat ended up advising three successive kosovo prime ministers and the multi-party negotiation team of kosovo .PERIOD 
and kosovo became independent .PERIOD 
independent diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world ,COMMA and we're advising seven or eight different countries ,COMMA or political groups ,COMMA depending on how you wish to define them -- and i'm not big on definitions .PERIOD 
we're advising the northern cypriots on how to reunify their island .PERIOD 
we're advising the burmese opposition ,COMMA the government of southern sudan ,COMMA which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years .PERIOD 
we're advising the polisario front of the western sahara ,COMMA who are fighting to get their country back from moroccan occupation after <NUM> years of dispossession .PERIOD 
we're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations ,COMMA which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen .PERIOD 
there's a bit of randomness here too because ,COMMA when i was beginning independent diplomat ,COMMA i went to a party in the house of lords ,COMMA which is a ridiculous place ,COMMA but i was holding my drink like this ,COMMA and i bumped into this guy who was standing behind me .PERIOD 
and we started talking ,COMMA and he said -- i told him what i was doing ,COMMA and i told him rather grandly i was going to establish independent diplomat in new york .PERIOD 
at that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to new york .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA why don't you see my colleagues in new york ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ?QUESTIONMARK what if ,COMMA which some of you have probably heard of .PERIOD 
and one thing led to another ,COMMA and i ended up having a desk in ?QUESTIONMARK what if !EXCLAMATIONMARK in new york ,COMMA when i started independent diplomat .PERIOD 
and watching ?QUESTIONMARK what if !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
develop new flavors of chewing gum for wrigley or new flavors for coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the kosovars and for the saharawis of the western sahara .PERIOD 
and i began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy ,COMMA like business ,COMMA is a business of solving problems ,COMMA and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy ;SEMICOLON it's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they've always done things .PERIOD 
and independent diplomat ,COMMA today ,COMMA tries to incorporate some of the things i learned at ?QUESTIONMARK what if .PERIOD 
we all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office .PERIOD 
we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think .PERIOD 
and we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with ,COMMA but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients .PERIOD 
it's not easy ,COMMA because our clients ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA are having a difficult time ,COMMA diplomatically .PERIOD 
there are ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA some lessons from all of this ,COMMA personal and political -- and in a way ,COMMA they're the same thing .PERIOD 
the personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing ,COMMA and i recommend it .PERIOD 
and it's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump .PERIOD 
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .PERIOD 
independent diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world ,COMMA which is that the world is fragmenting .PERIOD 
states mean less than they used to ,COMMA and the power of the state is declining .PERIOD 
that means the power of others things is rising .PERIOD 
those other things are called non-state actors .PERIOD 
they may be corporations ,COMMA they may be mafiosi ,COMMA they may be nice ngos ,COMMA they may anything ,COMMA any number of things .PERIOD 
we are living in a more complicated and fragmented world .PERIOD 
if governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world ,COMMA then that means ,COMMA who is left to deal with them ,COMMA who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ?QUESTIONMARK 
us .PERIOD 
we have no choice but to embrace that reality .PERIOD 
what this means is it's no longer good enough to say that international relations ,COMMA or global affairs ,COMMA or chaos in somalia ,COMMA or what's going on in burma is none of your business ,COMMA and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .PERIOD 
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al-shabaab militia in somalia .PERIOD 
ask me how later ,COMMA particularly if you eat fish ,COMMA interestingly enough ,COMMA but that connection is there .PERIOD 
we are all intimately connected .PERIOD 
and this isn't just tom friedman ,COMMA it's actually provable in case after case after case .PERIOD 
what that means is ,COMMA instead of asking your politicians to do things ,COMMA you have to look to yourself to do things .PERIOD 
and independent diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way .PERIOD 
there aren't neat examples ,COMMA but one example is this :COLON the way the world is changing is embodied in what's going on at the place i used to work -- the un .PERIOD security council .PERIOD 
the un .PERIOD was established in <NUM> .PERIOD 
its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the agenda of the un .PERIOD security council is about conflicts within states ,COMMA involving non-state parties -- guerillas ,COMMA separatists ,COMMA terrorists ,COMMA if you want to call them that ,COMMA people who are not normal governments ,COMMA who are not normal states .PERIOD 
that is the state of the world today .PERIOD 
when i realized this ,COMMA and when i look back on my time at the security council and what happened with the kosovars ,COMMA and i realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the security council weren't actually there ,COMMA weren't actually invited to give their views to the security council ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA this is wrong .PERIOD 
something's got to be done about this .PERIOD 
so i started off in a traditional mode .PERIOD 
me and my colleagues at independent diplomat went around the un .PERIOD security council .PERIOD 
we went around <NUM> un .PERIOD member states -- the kazaks ,COMMA the ethiopians ,COMMA the israelis -- you name them ,COMMA we went to see them -- the secretary general ,COMMA all of them ,COMMA and said ,COMMA this is all wrong .PERIOD 
this is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected .PERIOD 
you've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the kosovars to come and tell you what they think .PERIOD 
this will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think .PERIOD 
it'll be great .PERIOD you can have an exchange .PERIOD 
you can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions ,COMMA which means your decisions will be more effective and durable .PERIOD 
super-logical ,COMMA you would think .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA incredibly logical .PERIOD so obvious ,COMMA anybody could get it .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA everybody got it .PERIOD everybody went ,COMMA yes ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you're absolutely right .PERIOD 
come back to us in maybe six months .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA nothing happened -- nobody did anything .PERIOD 
the security council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did x number of years ago ,COMMA when i was there <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
so we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought ,COMMA what can we do about it .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA i'm buggered if i'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done .PERIOD 
so what we're going to do is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves .PERIOD 
so now ,COMMA independent diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the un .PERIOD security council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the security council .PERIOD 
and we will be trying to bring the parties to new york to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the u .PERIOD n .PERIOD security council ,COMMA and for the members of the un .PERIOD security council to explain to them what they want .PERIOD 
so there's actually a conversation ,COMMA which has never before happened .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA describing all this ,COMMA any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult ,COMMA and i entirely agree with you .PERIOD 
the chances of failure are very high ,COMMA but it certainly won't happen if we don't try to make it happen .PERIOD 
and my politics has changed fundamentally from when i was a diplomat to what i am today ,COMMA and i think that outputs is what matters ,COMMA not process ,COMMA not technology ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA so much either .PERIOD 
preach technology to all the twittering members of all the iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in tehran ,COMMA where ahmadinejad remains in power .PERIOD 
technology has not delivered political change in iran .PERIOD 
you've got to look at the outputs ,COMMA and you got to say to yourself ,COMMA what can i do to produce that particular output ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's my story .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
i want to say that really and truly ,COMMA after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread ,COMMA i am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television .PERIOD 
so most everyone watches tv .PERIOD 
we like it .PERIOD we like some parts of it .PERIOD 
here in america ,COMMA people actually love tv .PERIOD 
the average american watches tv for almost <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD 
okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
now i happen to make my living these days in television ,COMMA so for me ,COMMA that's a good thing .PERIOD 
but a lot of people don't love it so much .PERIOD 
they ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA berate it .PERIOD 
they call it stupid ,COMMA and worse ,COMMA believe me .PERIOD 
my mother ,COMMA growing up ,COMMA she called it the idiot box .PERIOD 
but my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good tv or bad tv ;SEMICOLON my idea today is to tell you that i believe television has a conscience .PERIOD 
so why i believe that television has a conscience is that i actually believe that television directly reflects the moral ,COMMA political ,COMMA social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system .PERIOD 
so all these things are uniquely human ,COMMA and they all add up to our idea of conscience .PERIOD 
we're talking about popular tv .PERIOD 
we're talking about top-10 nielsen-rated shows over the course of <NUM> years .PERIOD 
how do these nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about ,COMMA which is the idea of our social ,COMMA collective unconscious ,COMMA but how do these top-10 nielsen-rated shows over <NUM> years reflect the idea of our social conscience ?QUESTIONMARK 
how does television evolve over time ,COMMA and what does this say about our society ?QUESTIONMARK 
now speaking of evolution ,COMMA from basic biology ,COMMA you probably remember that the animal kingdom ,COMMA including humans ,COMMA have four basic primal instincts .PERIOD 
you have hunger ;SEMICOLON you have sex ;SEMICOLON you have power ;SEMICOLON and you have the urge for acquisitiveness .PERIOD 
as humans ,COMMA what's important to remember is that we've developed ,COMMA we've evolved over time to temper ,COMMA or tame ,COMMA these basic animal instincts .PERIOD 
we have the capacity to laugh and cry .PERIOD 
we feel awe ,COMMA we feel pity .PERIOD 
that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained .PERIOD 
we love to watch tv .PERIOD 
animals might love to play ,COMMA but they don't love to watch .PERIOD 
so i had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious .PERIOD 
why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?QUESTIONMARK 
i kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders .PERIOD 
so to begin to answer these questions ,COMMA we did a research study .PERIOD 
we went back <NUM> years to the <NUM>/<NUM> television season .PERIOD 
we talked to over <NUM> individuals -- almost <NUM> -- aged <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA and we asked them how they felt emotionally .PERIOD 
how did you feel watching every single one of these shows ?QUESTIONMARK 
did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ?QUESTIONMARK 
did you feel outrage ?QUESTIONMARK did you laugh ?QUESTIONMARK 
what did this mean for you ?QUESTIONMARK 
so to our global ted audiences ,COMMA i want to say that this was a us .PERIOD sample .PERIOD 
but as you can see ,COMMA these emotional need states are truly universal .PERIOD 
and on a factual basis ,COMMA over <NUM> percent of the us's most popular shows are exported around the world .PERIOD 
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .PERIOD 
two acknowledgments before our first data slide :COLON for inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis ,COMMA i thank legendary rabbi ,COMMA jack stern .PERIOD 
and for the way in which i'm going to present the data ,COMMA i want to thank ted community superstar hans rosling ,COMMA who you may have just seen .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA here we go .PERIOD 
so here you see ,COMMA from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA the <NUM> years of our study .PERIOD 
two things we're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state ,COMMA which ,COMMA for this purpose ,COMMA we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me ,COMMA that make me feel much more positive about the world .PERIOD 
moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which i don't understand the difference between right and wrong .PERIOD 
as we start ,COMMA you see in <NUM> inspiration is holding steady .PERIOD 
that's what we're watching tv for .PERIOD 
moral ambiguity starts to climb .PERIOD 
right at the end of the 60s ,COMMA moral ambiguity is going up ,COMMA inspiration is kind of on the wane .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK 
the cuban missile crisis ,COMMA jfk is shot ,COMMA the civil rights movement ,COMMA race riots ,COMMA the vietnam war ,COMMA mlk is shot ,COMMA bobby kennedy is shot ,COMMA watergate .PERIOD 
look what happens .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA inspiration plummets .PERIOD 
moral ambiguity takes off .PERIOD 
they cross ,COMMA but ronald reagan ,COMMA a telegenic president ,COMMA is in office .PERIOD 
it's trying to recover .PERIOD 
but look ,COMMA it can't :COLON aids ,COMMA iran-contra ,COMMA the challenger disaster ,COMMA chernobyl .PERIOD 
moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from <NUM> for the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
take a look at this .PERIOD 
this chart is going to document a very similar trend .PERIOD 
but in this case ,COMMA we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green .PERIOD 
now this time on tv you have bonanza ,COMMA don't forget ,COMMA you have gunsmoke ,COMMA you have andy griffith ,COMMA you have domestic shows all about comfort .PERIOD 
this is rising .PERIOD comfort stays whole .PERIOD 
irreverence starts to rise .PERIOD 
social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .PERIOD 
you get to <NUM> ,COMMA and look what happens .PERIOD 
you have comfort ,COMMA irreverence ,COMMA and social commentary ,COMMA not only battling it out in our society ,COMMA but you literally have two establishment shows -- gunsmoke and gomer pyle -- in <NUM> are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows .PERIOD 
what's number one ?QUESTIONMARK 
the socially irreverent hippie show ,COMMA rowan and martin's laugh-in .PERIOD 
they're all living together ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
look at this green spike in <NUM> to a bellwether show .PERIOD 
when you guys hear this industry term ,COMMA a breakout hit ,COMMA what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
it means in the <NUM> television season ,COMMA the smothers brothers came out of nowhere .PERIOD 
that's what we mean by a breakout show .PERIOD 
so then ,COMMA just like the last chart ,COMMA look what happens .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA the dam bursts .PERIOD the dam bursts .PERIOD 
comfort is no longer why we watch television .PERIOD 
social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s .PERIOD 
now look at this .PERIOD 
the 70s means who ?QUESTIONMARK norman lear .PERIOD 
you have all in the family ,COMMA sanford and son ,COMMA and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- m*a*s*h .PERIOD 
in the entire <NUM> years of television that we studied ,COMMA seven of <NUM> shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the vietnam war ,COMMA five of the top-10 during the nixon administration .PERIOD 
only one generation ,COMMA <NUM> years in ,COMMA and we discovered ,COMMA wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK tv can do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it can make me feel this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so to this very ,COMMA very savvy crowd ,COMMA i also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive .PERIOD 
archie bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
this is a quick chart .PERIOD here's another attribute :COLON fantasy and imagination ,COMMA which are shows defined as ,COMMA takes me out of my everyday realm and makes me feel better .PERIOD 
you'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise ,COMMA it maps to a spike in unemployment .PERIOD 
do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ?QUESTIONMARK 
no .PERIOD in the 70s you have the bellwether show the bionic woman that rocketed into the top-10 in <NUM> ,COMMA followed by the six million-dollar man and charlie's angels .PERIOD 
another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power .PERIOD 
what were those shows ?QUESTIONMARK 
glamorous and rich .PERIOD 
dallas ,COMMA fantasy island .PERIOD 
incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts :COLON unemployment .PERIOD 
so here you are ,COMMA in my favorite chart ,COMMA because this is our last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
whether or not you're in my business ,COMMA you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality tv .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA as we say in the business ,COMMA x marks the spot .PERIOD 
the 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching friends ,COMMA frasier ,COMMA cheers and seinfeld .PERIOD 
everything's good ,COMMA low unemployment .PERIOD 
but look :COLON x marks the spot .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA the september <NUM> television season ,COMMA humor succumbs to judgment once and for all .PERIOD 
why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
we had a <NUM> presidential election decided by the supreme court .PERIOD 
we had <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon .PERIOD 
look what happens when we keep going .PERIOD 
at the turn of the century ,COMMA the internet takes off ,COMMA reality television has taken hold .PERIOD 
what do people want in their tv then ?QUESTIONMARK 
i would have thought revenge or nostalgia .PERIOD 
give me some comfort ;SEMICOLON my world is falling apart .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA they want judgment .PERIOD 
i can keep sarah palin's daughter dancing .PERIOD 
i can choose the next american idol .PERIOD you're fired .PERIOD 
that's all great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
so as dramatically different as these television shows ,COMMA pure entertainment ,COMMA have been over the last <NUM> years -- what did i start with ?QUESTIONMARK -- one basic instinct remains .PERIOD 
we're animals ,COMMA we need our moms .PERIOD 
the 1950s :COLON june cleever in the original comfort show ,COMMA leave it to beaver .PERIOD 
lucille ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s .PERIOD 
the 1980s ,COMMA our first cougar was given to us in the form of alexis carrington .PERIOD 
now i don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience ,COMMA sitting on television's shoulders ,COMMA but i do know that i absolutely love this image .PERIOD 
so to you all ,COMMA the women of tedwomen ,COMMA the men of tedwomen ,COMMA the global audiences of tedwomen ,COMMA thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television .PERIOD 
but let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television .PERIOD 
they give it life on television ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA but it's you as viewers ,COMMA through your collective social consciences ,COMMA that give it life ,COMMA longevity ,COMMA power or not .PERIOD 
so thanks very much .PERIOD 
i have a question for you :COLON are you religious ?QUESTIONMARK 
please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person .PERIOD 
let's see ,COMMA i'd say about three or four percent .PERIOD 
i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA here's another question :COLON do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way ,COMMA shape or form ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hand .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA that's the majority .PERIOD 
my talk today is about the main reason ,COMMA or one of the main reasons ,COMMA why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way ,COMMA shape or form .PERIOD 
my talk today is about self-transcendence .PERIOD 
it's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away .PERIOD 
and when that happens ,COMMA the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings .PERIOD 
we talk about being uplifted or elevated .PERIOD 
now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor .PERIOD 
think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms ,COMMA most of which we're very familiar with .PERIOD 
but sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase .PERIOD 
we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .PERIOD 
he collected all kinds of case studies .PERIOD 
he quoted the words of all kinds of people who'd had a variety of these experiences .PERIOD 
one of the most exciting to me is this young man ,COMMA stephen bradley ,COMMA had an encounter ,COMMA he thought ,COMMA with jesus in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and here's what bradley said about it .PERIOD 
stephen bradley :COLON i thought i saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room ,COMMA with arms extended ,COMMA appearing to say to me ,COMMA come .PERIOD 
the next day i rejoiced with trembling .PERIOD 
my happiness was so great that i said i wanted to die .PERIOD 
this world had no place in my affections .PERIOD 
but now i desired the welfare of all mankind and could ,COMMA with a feeling heart ,COMMA forgive my worst enemies .PERIOD 
so note how bradley's petty ,COMMA moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase .PERIOD 
the world's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase .PERIOD 
some shut down the self using meditation .PERIOD 
others use psychedelic drugs .PERIOD 
this is from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god .PERIOD 
others use dancing ,COMMA spinning and circling to promote self-transcendence .PERIOD 
but you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase .PERIOD 
lots of people find self-transcendence in nature .PERIOD 
others overcome their self at raves .PERIOD 
so many books about war say the same thing ,COMMA that nothing brings people together like war .PERIOD 
and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences .PERIOD 
i'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray .PERIOD 
gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii .PERIOD 
and after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle .PERIOD 
here's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase .PERIOD 
glenn gray :COLON many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives .PERIOD 
i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy .PERIOD 
i may fall ,COMMA but i do not die ,COMMA for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life .PERIOD 
so what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out ,COMMA or melt away ,COMMA and it feels good ,COMMA it feels really good ,COMMA in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives .PERIOD 
it feels somehow uplifting .PERIOD 
this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim .PERIOD 
durkheim even called us homo duplex ,COMMA or two-level man .PERIOD 
the lower level he called the level of the profane .PERIOD 
and in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals .PERIOD 
we want to satisfy our individual desires .PERIOD 
we pursue our individual goals .PERIOD 
but sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change .PERIOD 
individuals unite into a team ,COMMA a movement or a nation ,COMMA which is far more than the sum of its parts .PERIOD 
durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group ,COMMA into a moral community .PERIOD 
and once people circle around some sacred object or value ,COMMA they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it .PERIOD 
durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of e pluribus unum ,COMMA of making a group out of individuals .PERIOD 
think of the collective joy in britain on the day world war ii ended .PERIOD 
think of the collective anger in tahrir square ,COMMA which brought down a dictator .PERIOD 
and think of the collective grief in the united states that we all felt ,COMMA that brought us all together ,COMMA after <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
so let me summarize where we are .PERIOD 
i'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence is just a basic part of being human .PERIOD 
i'm saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .PERIOD 
when we climb that staircase ,COMMA self-interest fades away ,COMMA we become just much less self-interested ,COMMA and we feel as though we are better ,COMMA nobler and somehow uplifted .PERIOD 
is it a product of natural selection ,COMMA like our hands ?QUESTIONMARK 
well many scientists who study religion take this view .PERIOD 
the new atheists ,COMMA for example ,COMMA argue that religion is a set of memes ,COMMA sort of parasitic memes ,COMMA that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff ,COMMA self-destructive stuff ,COMMA like suicide bombing .PERIOD 
and after all ,COMMA how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest ?QUESTIONMARK 
well let me show you .PERIOD 
in the descent of man ,COMMA charles darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from ,COMMA why do we have it .PERIOD 
darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves ,COMMA but they're of great use to our groups .PERIOD 
he wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA if the one tribe included a great number of courageous ,COMMA sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other ,COMMA this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other .PERIOD 
he went on to say that selfish and contentious people will not cohere ,COMMA and without coherence nothing can be effected .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA charles darwin believed in group selection .PERIOD 
now this idea has been very controversial for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA but it's about to make a major comeback this year ,COMMA especially after eo .PERIOD wilson's book comes out in april ,COMMA making a very strong case that we ,COMMA and several other species ,COMMA are products of group selection .PERIOD 
but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection .PERIOD 
so look at it this way :COLON you've got competition going on within groups and across groups .PERIOD 
so here's a group of guys on a college crew team .PERIOD 
within this team there's competition .PERIOD 
there are guys competing with each other .PERIOD 
the slowest rowers ,COMMA the weakest rowers ,COMMA are going to get cut from the team .PERIOD 
and only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport .PERIOD 
maybe one of them will make it to the olympics .PERIOD 
so within the team ,COMMA their interests are actually pitted against each other .PERIOD 
and sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys .PERIOD 
maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach .PERIOD 
but while that competition is going on within the boat ,COMMA this competition is going on across boats .PERIOD 
and once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat ,COMMA now they've got no choice but to cooperate because they're all in the same boat .PERIOD 
they can only win if they all pull together as a team .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA these things sound trite ,COMMA but they are deep evolutionary truths .PERIOD 
the main argument against group selection has always been that ,COMMA well sure ,COMMA it would be nice to have a group of cooperators ,COMMA but as soon as you have a group of cooperators ,COMMA they're just going to get taken over by free-riders ,COMMA individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .PERIOD 
let me illustrate this for you .PERIOD 
suppose we've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria ,COMMA they can be hamsters ;SEMICOLON it doesn't matter what -- and let's suppose that this little group here ,COMMA they evolved to be cooperative .PERIOD 
well that's great .PERIOD they graze ,COMMA they defend each other ,COMMA they work together ,COMMA they generate wealth .PERIOD 
and as you'll see in this simulation ,COMMA as they interact they gain points ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA they grow ,COMMA and when they've doubled in size ,COMMA you'll see them split ,COMMA and that's how they reproduce and the population grows .PERIOD 
but suppose then that one of them mutates .PERIOD 
it takes advantage of the others .PERIOD 
and so when a green interacts with a blue ,COMMA you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller .PERIOD 
so here's how things play out .PERIOD 
we start with just one green ,COMMA and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food .PERIOD 
and in short order ,COMMA the cooperators are done for .PERIOD 
the free-riders have taken over .PERIOD 
if a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started .PERIOD 
but there are solutions to the free-rider problem .PERIOD 
it's not that hard a problem .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA nature has solved it many ,COMMA many times .PERIOD 
and nature's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own dna ,COMMA totally separate from the dna in the nucleus ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism .PERIOD 
somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another ;SEMICOLON we'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them ,COMMA they were all in the same membrane ,COMMA now all the wealth-created division of labor ,COMMA all the greatness created by cooperation ,COMMA stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism .PERIOD 
and now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders ,COMMA of defectors ,COMMA of cheaters and look what happens .PERIOD 
a superorganism can basically take what it wants .PERIOD 
what i've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history .PERIOD 
darwin's laws don't change ,COMMA but now there's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different .PERIOD 
now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria .PERIOD 
it happened again about <NUM> or a <NUM> million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple ,COMMA primitive nests ,COMMA or hives .PERIOD 
once several wasps were all together in the same hive ,COMMA they had no choice but to cooperate ,COMMA because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives .PERIOD 
and the most cohesive hives won ,COMMA just as darwin said .PERIOD 
these early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere .PERIOD 
and it happened again ,COMMA even more spectacularly ,COMMA in the last half-million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures ,COMMA they came together around a hearth or a campfire ,COMMA they divided labor ,COMMA they began painting their bodies ,COMMA they spoke their own dialects ,COMMA and eventually they worshiped their own gods .PERIOD 
once they were all in the same tribe ,COMMA they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside .PERIOD 
and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet ,COMMA which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives .PERIOD 
human groups may look like hives for brief moments ,COMMA but they tend to then break apart .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA often ,COMMA as we've seen happen in a lot of the arab spring revolts ,COMMA often those divisions are along religious lines .PERIOD 
nonetheless ,COMMA when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement ,COMMA they can move mountains .PERIOD 
look at the people in these photos i've been showing you .PERIOD 
do you think they're there pursuing their self-interest ?QUESTIONMARK 
or are they pursuing communal interest ,COMMA which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA so that was my talk delivered in the standard ted way .PERIOD 
and now i'm going to give the whole talk over again in three minutes in a more full-spectrum sort of way .PERIOD 
jonathan haidt :COLON we humans have many varieties of religious experience ,COMMA as william james explained .PERIOD 
one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves .PERIOD 
the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred ,COMMA or deeply interconnected .PERIOD 
we are homo duplex ,COMMA as durkheim explained .PERIOD 
and we are homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection ,COMMA as darwin explained .PERIOD 
i can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug ,COMMA but if it is an adaptation ,COMMA then the implications are profound .PERIOD 
if it is an adaptation ,COMMA then we evolved to be religious .PERIOD 
i don't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions .PERIOD 
those things came along too recently .PERIOD 
i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects ,COMMA people and ideas .PERIOD 
this is why politics is so tribal .PERIOD 
politics is partly profane ,COMMA it's partly about self-interest ,COMMA but politics is also about sacredness .PERIOD 
it's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas .PERIOD 
it's about the eternal struggle between good and evil ,COMMA and we all believe we're on the good team .PERIOD 
and most importantly ,COMMA if the staircase is real ,COMMA it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life .PERIOD 
because human beings are ,COMMA to some extent ,COMMA hivish creatures like bees .PERIOD 
we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed .PERIOD 
nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom .PERIOD 
but sometimes we wonder :COLON is this all there is ?QUESTIONMARK 
what should i do with my life ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's missing is that we are homo duplex ,COMMA but modern ,COMMA secular society was built to satisfy our lower ,COMMA profane selves .PERIOD 
it's really comfortable down here on the lower level .PERIOD 
come ,COMMA have a seat in my home entertainment center .PERIOD 
one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top .PERIOD 
i see this desire in my students at the university of virginia .PERIOD 
they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into .PERIOD 
they're all searching for their staircase .PERIOD 
most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger .PERIOD 
and this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
no man is an island entire of itself .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves ,COMMA but first i want to tell you why i'm here .PERIOD 
i'm here for two reasons .PERIOD these two guys are my two sons ford and wren .PERIOD 
when ford was about three years old ,COMMA we shared a very small room together ,COMMA in a very small space .PERIOD 
my office was on one half of the bedroom ,COMMA and his bedroom was on the other half .PERIOD 
and you can imagine ,COMMA if you're a writer ,COMMA that things would get really crowded around deadlines .PERIOD 
so when wren was on the way ,COMMA i realized i needed to find a space of my own .PERIOD 
it had everything i needed .PERIOD it was quiet .PERIOD 
as i was building this space ,COMMA i thought to myself ,COMMA surely i'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own .PERIOD 
so i did some research .PERIOD 
and i found that there was an historic precedence .PERIOD 
hemingway had his writing space .PERIOD 
elvis had two or three manspaces ,COMMA which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in graceland .PERIOD 
in the popular culture ,COMMA superman had the fortress of solitude ,COMMA and there was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the batcave .PERIOD 
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .PERIOD 
here is one of the first spaces i found .PERIOD it is in austin ,COMMA texas ,COMMA which is where i'm from .PERIOD 
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage ,COMMA a nice garage .PERIOD 
but on the inside ,COMMA it's anything but .PERIOD 
and this ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is a pretty classic manspace .PERIOD 
it has neon concert posters ,COMMA a bar and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the leg lamp ,COMMA which is very important .PERIOD 
i soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside .PERIOD 
this guy built a bowling alley in his backyard ,COMMA out of landscaping timbers ,COMMA astroturf .PERIOD 
and he found the scoreboard in the trash .PERIOD 
here's another outdoor space ,COMMA a little bit more sophisticated .PERIOD 
this a <NUM> wooden tugboat ,COMMA made completely out of douglas fir .PERIOD 
the guy did it all himself .PERIOD 
and there is about <NUM> square feet of hanging-out space inside .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA pretty early on in my investigations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find ,COMMA which was ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen tvs .PERIOD 
there were definitely hang-out spots .PERIOD 
but some were for working ,COMMA some were for playing ,COMMA some were for guys to collect their things .PERIOD 
most of all ,COMMA i was just surprised with what i was finding .PERIOD 
take this place for example .PERIOD 
on the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage .PERIOD 
this is in long island ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
the only thing that might tip you off is the round window .PERIOD 
on the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century japanese tea house .PERIOD 
the man imported all the materials from japan ,COMMA and he hired a japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style .PERIOD 
it has no nails or screws .PERIOD 
all the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed .PERIOD 
here is another pretty typical scene .PERIOD this is a suburban las vegas neighborhood .PERIOD 
but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside .PERIOD 
and so there is a good reason for this .PERIOD 
it was built by this man who is wayne mccullough .PERIOD 
and right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments ,COMMA which is another sort of important part about a manspace .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA while this space represents someone's profession ,COMMA this one certainly represents a passion .PERIOD 
it's made to look like the inside of an english sailing ship .PERIOD 
it's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as i came to the end of my journey ,COMMA i found over <NUM> spaces .PERIOD 
and they were unexpected and they were surprising .PERIOD 
but they were also -- i was really impressed by how personalized they were ,COMMA and how much work went into them .PERIOD 
and i realized that's because the guys that i met were all very passionate about what they did .PERIOD 
and they really loved their professions .PERIOD 
and they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies .PERIOD 
and so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do ,COMMA and who they were .PERIOD 
so if you don't have a space of your own ,COMMA i highly recommend finding one ,COMMA and getting into it .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal ,COMMA and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work ,COMMA unlike powerpoint and some other programs .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i agree that you have to -- yeah ,COMMA there are certain concessions and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you use a slide projector ,COMMA you're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side ,COMMA or up or down ,COMMA but maybe that's an ok .PERIOD trade-off ,COMMA to trade that off for a focus .PERIOD 
it's a thought .PERIOD just a thought .PERIOD 
and there's something nice about slides getting stuck .PERIOD 
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up ,COMMA which we won't see tonight .PERIOD so .PERIOD 
with that ,COMMA let's get the first slide up here .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA as many of you have probably guessed ,COMMA is a recently emptied beer can in portugal .PERIOD 
this -- i had just arrived in barcelona for the first time ,COMMA and i thought -- you know ,COMMA fly all night ,COMMA i looked up ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA wow ,COMMA how clean .PERIOD 
you come into this major airport ,COMMA and they simply have a b .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA how nice is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
everything's gotten simpler in design ,COMMA and here's this mega airport ,COMMA and god ,COMMA i just -- i took a picture .PERIOD 
i thought ,COMMA god ,COMMA that is the coolest thing i've ever seen at an airport .PERIOD 
till a couple months later ,COMMA i went back to the same airport -- same plane ,COMMA i think -- and looked up ,COMMA and it said c .PERIOD 
it was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into .PERIOD 
i'm a big believer in the emotion of design ,COMMA and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read ,COMMA before they get the rest of the information ;SEMICOLON what is the emotional response they get to the product ,COMMA to the story ,COMMA to the painting -- whatever it is .PERIOD 
that area of design interests me the most ,COMMA and i think this for me is a real clear ,COMMA very simplified version of what i'm talking about .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's pretty clear .PERIOD 
take a look at the second door and see if there's any different message .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA which one would you park in front of ?QUESTIONMARK 
same color ,COMMA same message ,COMMA same words .PERIOD 
the only thing that's different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and ,COMMA again ,COMMA which is the psycho-killer here ?QUESTIONMARK 
yet it doesn't say that ;SEMICOLON it doesn't need to say that .PERIOD 
i would probably park in front of the other one .PERIOD 
i'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so .PERIOD 
it's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive .PERIOD 
but i was in milan and saw this street sign ,COMMA and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist .PERIOD 
and this graffiti artist has come along ,COMMA made this sign a little bit better ,COMMA and then moved on .PERIOD 
he didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do .PERIOD 
i took some photos ,COMMA and this is a billboard in florida ,COMMA and either they hadn't paid their rent ,COMMA or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign ,COMMA and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down ,COMMA so they just teared out sections of it .PERIOD 
and i would argue that it's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention ,COMMA getting you to look over that way .PERIOD 
and hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- stuckey's .PERIOD 
this is from my second book .PERIOD 
the first book is called ,COMMA the end of print ,COMMA and it was done along with a film ,COMMA working with william burroughs .PERIOD 
and the end of print is now in its fifth printing .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's fine ;SEMICOLON i just would love to have your input on this film and this book ,COMMA and he finally agreed to it .PERIOD 
and at the end of the film ,COMMA he says in this great voice that i can't mimic but i'll kind of try ,COMMA but not really ,COMMA he says ,COMMA i remember attending an exhibition called ,COMMA 'photography :COLON the end of painting' and then he says ,COMMA and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it wasn't at all .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA apparently when photography was perfected ,COMMA there were people going around saying ,COMMA that's it :COLON you've just ruined painting .PERIOD 
people are just going to take pictures now .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA that wasn't the case .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is from 2nd sight ,COMMA a book i did on intuition .PERIOD 
i think it's not the only ingredient in design ,COMMA but possibly the most important .PERIOD 
it's something everybody has .PERIOD 
it's not a matter of teaching it ;SEMICOLON in fact ,COMMA most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it :COLON it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design ,COMMA but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter .PERIOD 
so it tends to get discounted .PERIOD 
this is a quote from albert einstein ,COMMA who says ,COMMA the intellect has little to do on the road to discovery .PERIOD 
there comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you ,COMMA and you don't know from where or why .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it's kind of like when somebody says ,COMMA who did that song ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the more you try to think about it ,COMMA the further the answer gets from you ,COMMA and the minute you stop thinking about it ,COMMA your intuition gives you that answer ,COMMA in a sense .PERIOD 
i like this for a couple of reasons .PERIOD 
if you've had any design courses ,COMMA they would teach you you can't read this .PERIOD 
i think you eventually can and ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA i think it's true .PERIOD 
don't mistake legibility for communication .PERIOD 
just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates .PERIOD 
more importantly ,COMMA it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i think that's sometimes an overlooked area .PERIOD 
this is working with marshall mcluhan .PERIOD 
i stayed and worked with his wife and son ,COMMA eric ,COMMA and we came up with close to <NUM> quotes from marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times ,COMMA predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising ,COMMA television ,COMMA media world .PERIOD 
and so this book is called probes .PERIOD it's another word for quotes .PERIOD 
and it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before ,COMMA and basically ,COMMA i've interpreted the different quotes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this was the contents page originally .PERIOD 
when i got done it was <NUM> pages ,COMMA and then the publisher ,COMMA gingko press ,COMMA ended up cutting it down considerably :COLON it's just under <NUM> pages now .PERIOD 
but i decided i liked this contents page -- i liked the way it looks -- so i kept it .PERIOD 
it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever ,COMMA but it's a nice spread ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in there .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a couple spreads from the book :COLON here mcluhan says ,COMMA the new media are not bridges between man and nature ;SEMICOLON they are nature .PERIOD 
the invention of printing did away with anonymity ,COMMA fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property ,COMMA which had never been done before printing .PERIOD 
when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies ,COMMA anxieties of all kinds result .PERIOD 
while people are engaged in creating a totally different world ,COMMA they always form vivid images of the preceding world .PERIOD 
i hate this stuff .PERIOD it's hard to read .PERIOD 
people in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe ,COMMA and no possible occupation except information gathering .PERIOD 
that was it .PERIOD that's all he saw as the options .PERIOD and not too far off .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a project for nine inch nails .PERIOD 
and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden ,COMMA and it was done right after <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
and i had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i had bought in la that the real estate person hadn't pointed out .PERIOD 
there was some bomb shelter built ,COMMA apparently in the '60s cuban missile crisis .PERIOD 
and i asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by ,COMMA and he goes ,COMMA it's something to do with the sewage system .PERIOD 
i was ,COMMA ok ;SEMICOLON that's fine .PERIOD 
i finally went down there ,COMMA and it was this old rusted circular thing ,COMMA and two beds ,COMMA and very kind of creepy and weird .PERIOD 
you'd think maybe cement ,COMMA possibly ,COMMA or something .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA i used this for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd ,COMMA and i've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape ,COMMA and it's ready .PERIOD i think i'm ready .PERIOD so .PERIOD 
this is an experiment ,COMMA really ,COMMA for a client ,COMMA quicksilver ,COMMA where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is a six-shot sequence .PERIOD 
i've taken one shot ;SEMICOLON i cropped it a few different ways .PERIOD 
and then the tiny line of copy says ,COMMA if you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website .PERIOD 
and my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture .PERIOD 
this is a group in new york called the coalition for a smoke-free environment -- asked me to do these posters .PERIOD 
they were wild-posted around new york city .PERIOD 
you can't really -- well ,COMMA you can't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff ,COMMA in a sense .PERIOD 
it says ,COMMA if the cigarette companies can lie ,COMMA then so can we .PERIOD but -- -- but i did .PERIOD 
these were literally wild-posted all over new york one night ,COMMA and there were definitely some heads turning ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people smoking and ,COMMA huh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and it was purposely done to look fairly serious .PERIOD 
it wasn't some ,COMMA you know ,COMMA weird grunge type or something ;SEMICOLON it looked like they might be real .PERIOD anyway .PERIOD 
poster for atlantic center for the arts ,COMMA a school in florida .PERIOD 
this amazes me .PERIOD this is a product i just found out .PERIOD 
i was in the caribbean at christmas ,COMMA and i'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin .PERIOD 
this was either an old product with new packaging ,COMMA or a brand-new package ,COMMA and i just thought ,COMMA yikes !EXCLAMATIONMARK how's that still happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
i do a lot of workshops all over the world ,COMMA really ,COMMA and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors .PERIOD 
i felt this was one of the more successful solutions .PERIOD 
the students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night ,COMMA and i just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom . .PERIOD 
i did some work for microsoft a few years back .PERIOD 
it was a worldwide branding campaign .PERIOD 
and it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology ;SEMICOLON i had no design training ,COMMA and sometimes people say ,COMMA well ,COMMA that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there's no product that i had to sell ;SEMICOLON it was simply the image of microsoft they were trying to improve .PERIOD 
they thought some people didn't like them .PERIOD 
and our goal was to try to humanize them a bit ,COMMA and what i did was add type and people to the ad ,COMMA which the previous campaign had not had ,COMMA and nobody remembered them ,COMMA and nobody referenced them .PERIOD 
and we were trying to say that ,COMMA hey ,COMMA some of these guys that work there are actually ok ;SEMICOLON some of them actually have friends and family ,COMMA and they're not all awful people .PERIOD 
and the umbrella campaign was thank god it's monday .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative :COLON their over-competitiveness ,COMMA their ,COMMA you know ,COMMA long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it .PERIOD 
you know :COLON thank god it's monday -- i get to go back to that little cubicle ,COMMA those fake gray walls ,COMMA and hear everybody else's conversations f or <NUM> hours and then go home .PERIOD 
it says ,COMMA wonder around .PERIOD and then it's a piece of the software .PERIOD 
and this is how the ad ran around the world .PERIOD 
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ;SEMICOLON germany made one slight change in the ad .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's kind of two issues here .PERIOD 
if you're going to put a kid in the ad ,COMMA pick one that looks alive .PERIOD 
i just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
he's just really hoping that boots up and ,COMMA you know . .PERIOD 
and then as the agency explained to me ,COMMA they said ,COMMA look ,COMMA we don't have little green people in our country ;SEMICOLON why would we put little green people in our ads ,COMMA for instance ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is some work from ray gun .PERIOD 
and the point of this magazine was to read the articles ,COMMA listen to the music ,COMMA and try to interpret it .PERIOD 
there's no grid ,COMMA there's no system ,COMMA there's nothing set up in advance .PERIOD 
this is an opener for brian eno ,COMMA and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music .PERIOD 
this is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school .PERIOD 
there's a lot of great writing in ray gun .PERIOD 
and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .PERIOD 
you could -- you could highlight it ;SEMICOLON you could make it helvetica or something :COLON it is the actual article .PERIOD 
i suppose you could eventually decode it ,COMMA but it's really not very well written ;SEMICOLON it really wouldn't be worthwhile .PERIOD 
having done a lot of magazines ,COMMA i'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories ,COMMA and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
and i was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times ,COMMA which was basically the moment of impact .PERIOD 
and people magazine ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA got probably the best shot .PERIOD 
but when i got into this magazine ,COMMA there's something kind of disturbing ,COMMA and this continued .PERIOD 
on the left we see people dying ;SEMICOLON we see people running for their lives .PERIOD 
and on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast .PERIOD 
the coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue .PERIOD 
look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through ?QUESTIONMARK -- and the copy says :COLON he knows just how to give me goosebumps .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA he jumps out of buildings .PERIOD it's -- unfortunately ,COMMA this one works ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA as a spread .PERIOD 
and this continued through the entire magazine .PERIOD 
this says :COLON one clean fits all .PERIOD .PERIOD 
it just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate .PERIOD 
and this one i think is possibly the worst :COLON two ladies ,COMMA both facing the same way ,COMMA both wearing jeans .PERIOD 
one -- who knows what she's going through ;SEMICOLON the other one is worried about model behavior and milk .PERIOD 
and -- i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this ,COMMA and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk ,COMMA and when they got back to their car ,COMMA they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event -- it had been a few months .PERIOD 
this was what they found on their car .PERIOD 
there's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car ,COMMA but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back .PERIOD 
somebody told me today there was this thing called folders ,COMMA but i don't know what they are .PERIOD 
these are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here .PERIOD 
we are wrapping up .PERIOD 
this i saw on the plane ,COMMA flying in ,COMMA for hot new products .PERIOD 
i'm not sure this is an improvement ,COMMA or a good idea ,COMMA because ,COMMA like ,COMMA if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer ,COMMA you can now get a plate in the keyboard ,COMMA so there's no more faking it -- that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway .PERIOD 
now there's a plate ,COMMA and it would be really ,COMMA really convenient to get a piece of pizza ,COMMA then type a little bit ,COMMA then . .PERIOD 
i'm just not sure this is improvement .PERIOD 
if you ever doubt the power of graphic design ,COMMA this is a very generic sign that literally says ,COMMA vote for hitler .PERIOD it says nothing else .PERIOD 
and this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion ,COMMA of graphic design ,COMMA even though ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA was a very generic poster at the time .PERIOD 
what's next ?QUESTIONMARK what's next is going to be people .PERIOD 
as we get more technically driven ,COMMA the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before .PERIOD 
you have to utilize who you are in your work .PERIOD 
nobody else can do that :COLON nobody else can pull from your background ,COMMA from your parents ,COMMA your upbringing ,COMMA your whole life experience .PERIOD 
if you allow that to happen ,COMMA it's really the only way you can do some unique work ,COMMA and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well .PERIOD 
this lady's advertising for her lost pit bull .PERIOD 
it's friendly -- she's underlined friendly -- that's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles .PERIOD she can't spell .PERIOD 
but more importantly ,COMMA she's willing to give you <NUM> bucks to go find this lost pit bull .PERIOD 
and i'm thinking ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA right ,COMMA i'll go look for a lost pit bill for <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
i have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles ,COMMA and you get charged by this thing and you go ,COMMA oh ,COMMA please be hercles ;SEMICOLON please be the friendly one .PERIOD 
i'm sure she never found the dog ,COMMA because i took the sign .PERIOD 
and the theme was courage ,COMMA and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer .PERIOD 
that's pretty high for most occupations .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the government would make a plane ;SEMICOLON they'd say ,COMMA go see if that one flies ,COMMA would you ?QUESTIONMARK 
some of them did ;SEMICOLON some of them didn't .PERIOD 
and i started thinking about some of these decisions i have to make between ,COMMA like ,COMMA serif versus san-serif .PERIOD 
and for the most part ,COMMA they're not real life-threatening .PERIOD 
why not experiment ?QUESTIONMARK why not have some fun ?QUESTIONMARK 
why not put some of yourself into the work ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when i was teaching ,COMMA i used to always ask the students ,COMMA what's the definition of a good job ?QUESTIONMARK 
and as teachers ,COMMA after you get all the answers ,COMMA you like to give them the correct answer .PERIOD 
and the best one i've heard -- i'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is :COLON if you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue -- would you be doing that same work ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if you would ,COMMA you've got a great job .PERIOD 
and if you wouldn't ,COMMA what the heck are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
you're going to be dead a really long time .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i don't know about you ,COMMA but i haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life .PERIOD 
should i be pro-technology ?QUESTIONMARK should i embrace it full arms ?QUESTIONMARK 
should i be wary ?QUESTIONMARK like you ,COMMA i'm very tempted by the latest thing .PERIOD 
but at the other hand ,COMMA a couple of years ago i gave up all of my possessions ,COMMA sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across <NUM> miles on the us .PERIOD back roads under the power of my one body ,COMMA fuelled mostly by twinkies and junk food .PERIOD 
and i've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways ,COMMA so it doesn't master my life .PERIOD 
at the same time ,COMMA i run a website on cool tools ,COMMA where i issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology .PERIOD 
so i'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity ,COMMA as it relates to nature ,COMMA as it relates to the spiritual .PERIOD 
and i'm not even sure we know what technology is .PERIOD 
and one definition of technology is that which is first recorded .PERIOD 
this is the first example of the modern use of technology that i can find .PERIOD 
it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in <NUM> .PERIOD 
i like one of the definitions that alan kay has for technology .PERIOD 
he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born .PERIOD 
so it sums up a lot of what we're talking about .PERIOD 
danny hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet .PERIOD 
which also ,COMMA i think ,COMMA gets into a little bit of our current idea .PERIOD 
but i was interested in another definition of technology .PERIOD 
something ,COMMA again ,COMMA that went back to something more fundamental .PERIOD 
something that was deeper .PERIOD and as i struggled to understand that ,COMMA i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations .PERIOD 
and i'm ,COMMA this morning ,COMMA going to talk about this for the first time .PERIOD 
so this is a very rough attempt to think out loud .PERIOD 
the question that i came up with was this question :COLON what does technology want ?QUESTIONMARK and by that ,COMMA i don't mean ,COMMA does it want chocolate or vanilla ?QUESTIONMARK by what it wants ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA what are its inherent trends and biases ?QUESTIONMARK 
what are its tendencies over time ?QUESTIONMARK one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms ,COMMA which we've heard a lot about .PERIOD 
and the trick that richard dawkins does ,COMMA which is to say ,COMMA to look at them as simply as genes ,COMMA as vehicles for genes .PERIOD 
so he's saying ,COMMA what do genes want ?QUESTIONMARK the selfish gene .PERIOD 
and i'm applying a similar trick to say ,COMMA what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ?QUESTIONMARK what does technology want ?QUESTIONMARK 
obviously ,COMMA this in an incomplete question ,COMMA just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it .PERIOD 
so that's where i want to begin my little exploration ,COMMA is in life .PERIOD 
and like you heard from the previous speakers ,COMMA we don't really know what life there is on earth right now .PERIOD 
we have really no idea .PERIOD 
craig venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence things in the ocean is great .PERIOD 
and one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects ,COMMA just to see what's on life .PERIOD and if we did that with our little martian probe ,COMMA which we have not done on earth ,COMMA we would begin to see some incredible species .PERIOD 
this is not on another planet .PERIOD these are things that are hidden away on our planet .PERIOD 
this is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen .PERIOD 
each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen from jamie and others ,COMMA these magnificent things -- what they're doing ,COMMA each one of them ,COMMA is they're hacking the rules of life .PERIOD 
i can't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism .PERIOD 
every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard olivia's talk about the sexual habits ,COMMA you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life ,COMMA because every single one of them is hacking something about it .PERIOD 
this is a solar-powered sea slug .PERIOD it's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy .PERIOD 
this is another version of that .PERIOD this is a sea dragon ,COMMA and the one on the bottom ,COMMA the blue one ,COMMA is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid ,COMMA has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy .PERIOD 
these are hacks ,COMMA and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are ,COMMA current consensus ,COMMA six kingdoms .PERIOD six different broad approaches :COLON the plants ,COMMA the animals ,COMMA the fungi ,COMMA the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the archaea bacteria .PERIOD the archaeas .PERIOD 
those are the general approaches to life .PERIOD that's one way to look at life on earth today .PERIOD 
but a more interesting way ,COMMA the current way to take the long view ,COMMA is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective .PERIOD 
and here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time ,COMMA we have it coming out from the center .PERIOD 
so in the center is the most primitive ,COMMA and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth .PERIOD this is all the same six kingdoms .PERIOD 
you see <NUM> representative species ,COMMA and you can see where we are .PERIOD 
but what i like about this is it shows that every living organism on earth today is equally evolved .PERIOD 
those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans .PERIOD 
they've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here .PERIOD 
but we see that each one of these is actually hacking ,COMMA and has a different way of finding out how to do life .PERIOD 
and if we take the long-term trends of life ,COMMA if we begin to say ,COMMA what does evolution want ?QUESTIONMARK there's several things that we see .PERIOD 
one of the things about evolution is that nowhere on earth have we ever been where we don't find life .PERIOD 
we find life at the bottom of every long-term ,COMMA long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock .PERIOD 
and wherever life is ,COMMA it never retreats .PERIOD it's ubiquitous and it wants to be more .PERIOD 
the second thing is is we see diversity .PERIOD we also see specialization .PERIOD 
we see the movement from a general-purpose cell to the more specific and specialized .PERIOD 
and we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time .PERIOD 
one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability .PERIOD and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life .PERIOD 
like those chloroplast cells -- they're completely surrounded by other life .PERIOD 
they never touch the inner matter .PERIOD there is more and more co-evolution .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA my question is ,COMMA what does technology want ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so ,COMMA remarkably ,COMMA i discovered that there's also a drift toward specialization .PERIOD 
this is all the contents of a japanese home .PERIOD 
i actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter ,COMMA and i gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household .PERIOD 
and it came up with <NUM> different species of products .PERIOD 
i did some research and found out that the king of england ,COMMA henry viii ,COMMA had only about <NUM> items in his household .PERIOD 
and he was the king of england ,COMMA and that was the entire wealth of england at the time .PERIOD 
so we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things .PERIOD 
this is a scene from star wars where the 3po comes out and he sees machines making machines .PERIOD how depraved !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
well ,COMMA this is actually what we're headed towards :COLON world machines .PERIOD 
and the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies .PERIOD 
most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non-technology ,COMMA or even life .PERIOD 
and thirdly ,COMMA the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche .PERIOD and i'm happy to say ,COMMA i was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological ,COMMA but that's pretty evident .PERIOD 
i suggest that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA technology is the seventh kingdom of life .PERIOD 
that its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom .PERIOD 
and so it would be sort of approximately up there ,COMMA coming out of the animal kingdom .PERIOD and if we were to do that ,COMMA we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way .PERIOD 
this is niles eldredge .PERIOD he was the co-developer with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium .PERIOD 
but as a sideline ,COMMA he happens to collect cornets .PERIOD 
and he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites ,COMMA or snails ,COMMA and to do a morphological analysis ,COMMA and try to derive their genealogical history over time .PERIOD 
this is his chart ,COMMA which is not quite published yet .PERIOD 
when something is extinct ,COMMA you can't have it as your parent .PERIOD 
but that does happen in technology .PERIOD and it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree ,COMMA and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that i began to think about what happens with old technology .PERIOD 
and it turns out that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA technologies don't die .PERIOD 
so i suggested this to an historian of science ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA come on ,COMMA what about steam cars ?QUESTIONMARK 
they're not around anymore .PERIOD well actually ,COMMA they are .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA they're so around that you can buy new parts for a stanley steam automobile .PERIOD 
and this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the stanley automobile .PERIOD and the thing that i liked is sort of this one-click ,COMMA add-to-your-cart button -- -- for buying steam valves .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA it was just -- it was really there .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i began to think about ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe that's just a random sample .PERIOD 
maybe i should do this sort of in a more conservative way .PERIOD 
so i took the great big <NUM> montgomery ward's catalog and i randomly went through it .PERIOD and i took a page -- not quite a random page -- i took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made .PERIOD but i took this page and i said ,COMMA how many of these things are still being made ?QUESTIONMARK 
and not antiques .PERIOD i want to know how many of these things are still in production .PERIOD 
and the answer is :COLON all of them .PERIOD 
all of them are still being produced .PERIOD so you've got corn shellers .PERIOD 
i don't know who needs a corn sheller .PERIOD 
be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs ;SEMICOLON you've got fan mills ;SEMICOLON all these things -- and these are not ,COMMA again ,COMMA antiques .PERIOD these are -- you can order these .PERIOD you can go to the web and you can buy them now ,COMMA brand-new made .PERIOD so in a certain sense ,COMMA technologies don't die .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA you can buy ,COMMA for <NUM> bucks ,COMMA a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
it's short ,COMMA bone handle ,COMMA <NUM> bucks .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA what's important is that this information actually never died out .PERIOD 
it's not just that it was resurrected .PERIOD it's continued all along .PERIOD 
and in papua new guinea ,COMMA they were making stone axes until two decades ago ,COMMA just as a course of practical matters .PERIOD 
even when we try to get rid of a technology ,COMMA it's actually very hard .PERIOD 
so we've all heard about the amish giving up cars .PERIOD 
we've heard about the japanese giving up guns .PERIOD 
we've heard about this and that .PERIOD but i actually went back and took what i could find ,COMMA the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology ,COMMA and then i tried to find out when they came back in ,COMMA because they always came back in .PERIOD and it turns out that the time ,COMMA the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited ,COMMA is decreasing over time .PERIOD and that basically ,COMMA you can delay technology ,COMMA but you can't kill it .PERIOD so this makes sense ,COMMA because in a certain sense what culture is ,COMMA is the accumulation of ideas .PERIOD 
that's what it's for .PERIOD it's so that ideas don't die out .PERIOD 
they're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated .PERIOD 
so what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas ,COMMA these new hacks ,COMMA are increasing .PERIOD and the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring .PERIOD 
and then what we see in the singularity ,COMMA that prophesized by kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution .PERIOD 
it's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas .PERIOD 
and what technology is really about is better ways to evolve .PERIOD 
that is what we call an infinite game .PERIOD 
that's the definition of infinite game .PERIOD a finite game is play to win ,COMMA and an infinite game is played to keep playing .PERIOD 
and i believe that technology is actually a cosmic force .PERIOD 
the origins of technology was not in <NUM> ,COMMA but was actually at the beginning of the big bang ,COMMA and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed .PERIOD the entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot ,COMMA and it was so tight in there ,COMMA there was no room for any difference at all .PERIOD 
that's the definition .PERIOD there was no temperature .PERIOD 
there was no difference whatsoever .PERIOD and at the big bang ,COMMA what it expanded was the potential for difference .PERIOD 
so as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA options ,COMMA choices ,COMMA opportunities ,COMMA possibilities and freedoms .PERIOD 
those are all basically the same thing .PERIOD 
and those are the things that technology brings us .PERIOD 
that's what technology is bringing us :COLON choices ,COMMA possibilities ,COMMA freedoms .PERIOD 
that's what it's about .PERIOD it's this expansion of room to make differences .PERIOD 
and so a hammer ,COMMA when we grab a hammer ,COMMA that's what we're grabbing .PERIOD 
and that's why we continue to grab technology -- because we want those things .PERIOD those things are good .PERIOD 
differences ,COMMA freedom ,COMMA choices ,COMMA possibilities .PERIOD 
and i think it's really important .PERIOD because if you can imagine mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .PERIOD 
imagine van gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .PERIOD 
imagine hitchcock before the technologies of film .PERIOD 
somewhere ,COMMA today ,COMMA there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented .PERIOD 
we have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference .PERIOD 
we want a trillion zillion species of one individuals .PERIOD 
that's what technology really wants .PERIOD 
i'm going to skip through some of the objections because i don't have answers to why there's deforestation .PERIOD 
i don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies .PERIOD i don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity ,COMMA other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom ,COMMA because it's so close to what life is about ,COMMA maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life .PERIOD 
maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it .PERIOD 
it's a terrible thing to spray ddt on cotton fields ,COMMA but it's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village .PERIOD 
our humanity is actually defined by technology .PERIOD 
all the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology .PERIOD this is the infinite game .PERIOD 
that's what we're talking about .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA technology is a way to evolve the evolution .PERIOD 
it's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more .PERIOD 
and it's actually a way of playing the game ,COMMA of playing all the games .PERIOD 
and so when i think about what technology wants ,COMMA i think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and i really believe this -- every person here has an assignment .PERIOD and your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is .PERIOD 
that recursive nature is the infinite game .PERIOD 
and if you play that well ,COMMA you'll have other people involved ,COMMA so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone .PERIOD 
that is the infinite game .PERIOD and what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game .PERIOD 
and so i think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i first became fascinated with octopus at an early age .PERIOD 
i grew up in mobile ,COMMA alabama -- somebody's got to be from mobile ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK -- and mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers ,COMMA forming this beautiful delta .PERIOD 
and the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes ,COMMA birds of every flavor .PERIOD 
it's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals ,COMMA to grow up in .PERIOD 
and this delta water flows to mobile bay ,COMMA and finally into the gulf of mexico .PERIOD 
and i remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six .PERIOD 
i was in the gulf ,COMMA and i was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom .PERIOD 
and i reached down and picked him up ,COMMA and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility .PERIOD 
it was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand .PERIOD 
it was all i could do to hold onto this amazing creature .PERIOD 
then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors ,COMMA just pulsing all of these colors .PERIOD 
and as i looked at it ,COMMA it kind of tucked its arms under it ,COMMA raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .PERIOD 
so i marveled for a moment ,COMMA and then decided it was time to release him ,COMMA so i put him down .PERIOD 
the octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing :COLON it landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- vanished right before my eyes .PERIOD 
and i knew ,COMMA right then ,COMMA at age six ,COMMA that is an animal that i want to learn more about .PERIOD so i did .PERIOD 
and i went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology ,COMMA and then moved to hawaii and entered graduate school at the university of hawaii .PERIOD 
and while a student at hawaii ,COMMA i worked at the waikiki aquarium .PERIOD 
and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays ,COMMA and being the spineless guy ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA well i'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals i had been learning about as a student and bring them in ,COMMA and i built these elaborate sets and put them on display .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at ,COMMA but they didn't really interact with people .PERIOD 
but the octopus did .PERIOD 
if you walked up to an octopus tank ,COMMA especially early in the morning before anyone arrived ,COMMA the octopus would rise up and look at you and you're thinking ,COMMA is that guy really looking at me ?QUESTIONMARK he is looking at me !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i went up to the front of the tank ,COMMA and he's just staring at me ,COMMA and he had little horns come up above his eyes .PERIOD 
so i went right up to the front of the tank -- i was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch ,COMMA a little rock ,COMMA and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass .PERIOD 
so i was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away ,COMMA and at that time i could actually focus that close ;SEMICOLON now as i look at my fuzzy fingers i realize those days are long gone .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA there we were ,COMMA staring at each other ,COMMA and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system ,COMMA and -- chk chk chk chk chk !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down .PERIOD 
he reaches up ,COMMA takes another armful of gravel ,COMMA releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- same thing .PERIOD 
then he lifts another arm and i lift an arm .PERIOD 
then he lifts another arm and i lift another arm .PERIOD 
and then i realize the octopus won the arms race ,COMMA because i was out and he had six left .PERIOD 
but the only way i can describe what i was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing ,COMMA which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA about three years into my degree ,COMMA a funny thing happened on the way to the office ,COMMA which actually changed the course of my life .PERIOD 
a man came into the aquarium .PERIOD it's a long story ,COMMA but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the south pacific to collect animals for him ,COMMA and as we left ,COMMA he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA make a movie about this expedition .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting ,COMMA and off we went .PERIOD and we did ,COMMA we made a movie ,COMMA which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making ,COMMA but it was a blast .PERIOD i had so much fun .PERIOD 
and i remember that proverbial light going off in my head ,COMMA thinking ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD 
maybe i can do this all the time .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i'll be a filmmaker .PERIOD 
so i literally came back from that job ,COMMA quit school ,COMMA hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that i didn't know what i was doing .PERIOD 
it's been a good ride .PERIOD 
but where i really learned about octopus was in the field ,COMMA as a filmmaker making films with them ,COMMA where you're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals ,COMMA seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes .PERIOD 
i remember i took a trip to australia ,COMMA went to an island called one tree island .PERIOD 
and apparently ,COMMA evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree ,COMMA between the time they named it and the time i arrived ,COMMA because i'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth ,COMMA twice a day ,COMMA pretty rapidly .PERIOD 
and there's a beautiful reef ,COMMA very complex reef ,COMMA with lots of animals ,COMMA including a lot of octopus .PERIOD 
and not uniquely but certainly ,COMMA the octopus in australia are masters at camouflage .PERIOD 
as a matter of fact ,COMMA there's one right there .PERIOD 
so our first challenge was to find these things ,COMMA and that was a challenge ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD 
but the idea is ,COMMA we were there for a month and i wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them .PERIOD 
so the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could ,COMMA every day a little closer ,COMMA a little closer ,COMMA a little closer .PERIOD 
and you knew what the limit was :COLON they would start getting twitchy and you'd back up ,COMMA come back in a few hours .PERIOD 
and after the first week ,COMMA they ignored us .PERIOD 
it was like ,COMMA i don't know what that thing is ,COMMA but he's no threat to me .PERIOD 
so they went on about their business and from a foot away ,COMMA we're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience .PERIOD 
and one of the most fantastic displays that i remember ,COMMA or at least visually ,COMMA was a foraging behavior .PERIOD 
and they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging ,COMMA but this particular one used vision .PERIOD 
and they would see a coral head ,COMMA maybe <NUM> feet away ,COMMA and start moving over toward that coral head .PERIOD 
and i don't know whether they actually saw crab in it ,COMMA or imagined that one might be ,COMMA but whatever the case ,COMMA they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head ,COMMA and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head ,COMMA and they would fish out ,COMMA swim for crabs .PERIOD 
and as soon as the crabs touched the arm ,COMMA it was lights out .PERIOD 
and i always wondered what happened under that web .PERIOD 
it was fantastic .PERIOD 
if you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals ,COMMA you might as well pick one that's fairly common .PERIOD 
they also live deep .PERIOD 
and i can't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep ,COMMA but whatever the case ,COMMA i like that .PERIOD 
it's like nothing you've ever done .PERIOD 
if you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen ,COMMA and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen ,COMMA get in a sub .PERIOD 
you climb in ,COMMA seal the hatch ,COMMA turn on a little oxygen ,COMMA turn on the scrubber ,COMMA which removes the co2 in the air you breathe ,COMMA and they chuck you overboard .PERIOD 
down you go .PERIOD there's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio .PERIOD 
and as you go down ,COMMA the washing machine at the surface calms down .PERIOD 
and it gets quiet .PERIOD 
and it starts getting really nice .PERIOD 
and now you've entered the realm of the mid-water community .PERIOD 
you could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid-water .PERIOD 
suffice to say though ,COMMA as far as i'm concerned ,COMMA without question ,COMMA the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid-water community .PERIOD 
the mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range ,COMMA <NUM> miles long ,COMMA snaking around the entire globe .PERIOD 
and they're big mountains ,COMMA thousands of feet tall ,COMMA some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface ,COMMA creating islands like hawaii .PERIOD 
and when you dive into that rift valley ,COMMA that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this <NUM> mile range .PERIOD 
and as these tectonic plates are spreading apart ,COMMA magma ,COMMA lava is coming up and filling those gaps ,COMMA and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes .PERIOD 
and over the tops of them is <NUM> to <NUM> meters of water creating enormous pressure ,COMMA forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth ,COMMA until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals ,COMMA reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at yellowstone .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA this whole area is like a yellowstone national park with all of the trimmings .PERIOD 
and this vent fluid is about <NUM> or <NUM> degrees f .PERIOD 
so it immediately cools ,COMMA and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it's dissolved ,COMMA and it precipitates out ,COMMA forming black smoke .PERIOD 
and it forms these towers ,COMMA these chimneys that are <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> feet tall .PERIOD 
and all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life .PERIOD 
you've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to <NUM> feet long .PERIOD 
and out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes .PERIOD 
and living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals :COLON shrimp ,COMMA fish ,COMMA lobsters ,COMMA crab ,COMMA clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold .PERIOD 
and this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and it completely threw science on its head .PERIOD 
it made scientists rethink where life on earth might have actually begun .PERIOD 
and before the discovery of these vents ,COMMA all life on earth ,COMMA the key to life on earth ,COMMA was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis .PERIOD 
but down there ,COMMA there is no sun ,COMMA there is no photosynthesis ;SEMICOLON it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it ,COMMA and it's all so ephemeral .PERIOD 
you might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent ,COMMA which you think at the time has to be on another planet .PERIOD 
it's amazing to think that this is actually on earth ;SEMICOLON it looks like aliens in an alien environment .PERIOD 
but you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead .PERIOD 
there's no hot water .PERIOD 
all of the animals are gone ,COMMA they're dead ,COMMA and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town ,COMMA an eerie ,COMMA spooky ghost town ,COMMA but essentially devoid of animals ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
but <NUM> miles down the ridge .PERIOD 
pshhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK there's another volcano going .PERIOD 
and there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed .PERIOD 
and that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community isn't really different from some of the areas that i've seen in <NUM> years of traveling around ,COMMA making films .PERIOD 
where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay .PERIOD 
and you go back ,COMMA and i'm at home ,COMMA and i'm thinking ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what can i shoot . .PERIOD 
ah !EXCLAMATIONMARK i know where i can shoot that .PERIOD 
there's this beautiful bay ,COMMA lots of soft corals and stomatopods .PERIOD 
and you show up ,COMMA and it's dead .PERIOD 
there's no coral ,COMMA algae growing on it ,COMMA and the water's pea soup .PERIOD 
you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you turn around ,COMMA and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in ,COMMA and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth .PERIOD 
and over here there's a golf course going in .PERIOD 
and this is the tropics .PERIOD 
it's raining like crazy here .PERIOD 
so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside ,COMMA carrying with it sediments from the construction site ,COMMA smothering the coral and killing it .PERIOD 
and fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals ,COMMA fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there's your pea soup .PERIOD 
i've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay .PERIOD 
and i looked at it ,COMMA just said ,COMMA yuck ,COMMA and go and work on the other side of the island .PERIOD 
five years later ,COMMA come back ,COMMA and that same bay is now gorgeous .PERIOD it's beautiful .PERIOD 
it's got living coral ,COMMA fish all over the place ,COMMA crystal clear water ,COMMA and you go ,COMMA how did that happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
they recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it ;SEMICOLON enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay ,COMMA and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay ,COMMA and the bay recovered .PERIOD 
the ocean has an amazing ability to recover ,COMMA if we'll just leave it alone .PERIOD 
i think margaret mead said it best .PERIOD 
she said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world .PERIOD 
indeed ,COMMA it's the only thing that ever has .PERIOD 
and a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay .PERIOD 
i'm a big fan of grassroots organizations .PERIOD 
i've been to a lot of lectures where ,COMMA at the end of it ,COMMA inevitably ,COMMA one of the first questions that comes up is ,COMMA but ,COMMA but what can i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm an individual .PERIOD i'm one person .PERIOD 
fair enough question .PERIOD 
look in your own backyard .PERIOD 
look in your heart ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
what do you really care about that isn't right where you live ?QUESTIONMARK 
and fix it .PERIOD 
create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same .PERIOD 
and maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map ,COMMA little dots on a map .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA the way that we can communicate today -- where alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in china ,COMMA and the kiwis did this ,COMMA and then over in england they tried to . .PERIOD 
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it's not isolated points on a map anymore ,COMMA it's a network we've created .PERIOD 
and maybe these healing zones can start growing ,COMMA and possibly even overlap ,COMMA and good things can happen .PERIOD 
so that's how i answer that question .PERIOD 
look in your own backyard ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA look in the mirror .PERIOD 
what can you do that is more responsible than what you're doing now ?QUESTIONMARK 
and do that ,COMMA and spread the word .PERIOD 
the vent community animals can't really do much about the life and death that's going on where they live ,COMMA but up here we can .PERIOD 
in theory ,COMMA we're thinking ,COMMA rational human beings .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA sylvia's ted prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could ,COMMA everything we could ,COMMA to set aside not pin pricks ,COMMA but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation ,COMMA hope spots ,COMMA she calls them .PERIOD 
and i applaud that .PERIOD i loudly applaud that .PERIOD 
and it's my hope that some of these hope spots can be in the deep ocean ,COMMA an area that has historically been seriously neglected ,COMMA if not abused .PERIOD 
the term deep six comes to mind :COLON if it's too big or too toxic for a landfill ,COMMA deep six it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i hope that we can also keep some of these hope spots in the deep sea .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i don't get a wish ,COMMA but i certainly can say that i will do anything i can to support sylvia earle's wish .PERIOD 
and that i do .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear .PERIOD 
let me explain .PERIOD 
there were plenty of role models all around us .PERIOD 
we had our mothers ,COMMA our aunts ,COMMA our cousins ,COMMA our sisters ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA the ever-present media bombarding us with images and words ,COMMA telling us how to be .PERIOD 
she was a homemaker ,COMMA but she and i didn't go out and do girlie things together ,COMMA and she didn't buy me pink outfits .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA she knew what i needed ,COMMA and she bought me a book of cartoons .PERIOD 
i drew ,COMMA and i drew ,COMMA and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family ,COMMA i could draw ,COMMA do what i wanted to do ,COMMA and not have to perform ,COMMA not have to speak -- i was very shy -- and i could still get approval .PERIOD 
i was launched as a cartoonist .PERIOD 
now when we're young ,COMMA we don't always know .PERIOD we know there are rules out there ,COMMA but we don't always know -- we don't perform them right ,COMMA even though we are imprinted at birth with these things ,COMMA and we're told what the most important color in the world is .PERIOD 
we're told what shape we're supposed to be in .PERIOD 
we're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave .PERIOD 
now the rules that i'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture .PERIOD 
we're being corrected ,COMMA and the primary policemen are women ,COMMA because we are the carriers of the tradition .PERIOD 
we pass it down from generation to generation .PERIOD 
not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us .PERIOD 
and on top of all off these rules ,COMMA they keep changing .PERIOD 
we don't know what's going on half the time ,COMMA so it puts us in a very tenuous position .PERIOD 
now if you don't like these rules ,COMMA and many of us don't -- i know i didn't ,COMMA and i still don't ,COMMA even though i follow them half the time ,COMMA not quite aware that i'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor ?QUESTIONMARK 
humor relies on the traditions of a society .PERIOD 
it takes what we know ,COMMA and it twists it .PERIOD 
it takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress ,COMMA and it makes it unexpected ,COMMA and that's what elicits a laugh .PERIOD 
now what if you put together women and humor ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think you can get change .PERIOD 
now i started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos .PERIOD 
i grew up not far from here in washington dc .PERIOD 
during the civil rights movement ,COMMA the assassinations ,COMMA the watergate hearings and then the feminist movement ,COMMA and i think i was drawing ,COMMA trying to figure out what was going on .PERIOD 
it didn't work .PERIOD 
my parents got divorced ,COMMA and my sister was arrested .PERIOD 
but i found my place .PERIOD 
i found that i didn't have to wear high heels ,COMMA i didn't have to wear pink ,COMMA and i could feel like i fit in .PERIOD 
now when i was a little older ,COMMA in my 20s ,COMMA i realized there are not many women in cartooning .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe i can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning ,COMMA and so i did .PERIOD i became a cartoonist .PERIOD 
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA why don't i do something ?QUESTIONMARK 
i always loved political cartoons ,COMMA so why don't i do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as laugh ?QUESTIONMARK 
now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly american perspective .PERIOD 
i can't help it .PERIOD i live here .PERIOD 
even though i've traveled a lot ,COMMA i still think like an american woman .PERIOD 
but i believe that the rules that i'm talking about are universal ,COMMA of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions ,COMMA and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the us .PERIOD 
consequently ,COMMA we have .PERIOD 
women ,COMMA because we're on the ground ,COMMA we know the tradition .PERIOD 
we have amazing antennae .PERIOD 
now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists ,COMMA which i so enjoy ,COMMA and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth ,COMMA to get at the issues quickly and succinctly .PERIOD 
and not only that ,COMMA it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect ,COMMA but through the heart .PERIOD 
my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as saudi arabia ,COMMA iran ,COMMA turkey ,COMMA argentina ,COMMA france -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties .PERIOD 
and these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances .PERIOD 
and we talk about how women have such strong perceptions ,COMMA because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition-keepers ,COMMA that we can have the great potential to be change-agents .PERIOD 
and i think ,COMMA i truly believe ,COMMA that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
cities are the crucible of civilization .PERIOD 
they have been expanding ,COMMA urbanization has been expanding ,COMMA at an exponential rate in the last <NUM> years so that by the second part of this century ,COMMA the planet will be completely dominated by cities .PERIOD 
cities are the origins of global warming ,COMMA impact on the environment ,COMMA health ,COMMA pollution ,COMMA disease ,COMMA finance ,COMMA economies ,COMMA energy -- they're all problems that are confronted by having cities .PERIOD 
that's where all these problems come from .PERIOD 
and the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet .PERIOD 
here's some numbers .PERIOD 
the planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago .PERIOD 
china's building <NUM> new cities in the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
this is going to affect everything .PERIOD 
everybody in this room ,COMMA if you stay alive ,COMMA is going to be affected by what's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon .PERIOD 
because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people ,COMMA creating ideas ,COMMA innovation ,COMMA wealth and so on .PERIOD 
and so there's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities .PERIOD 
now these are my comrades in arms .PERIOD 
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people ,COMMA and they've done all the work ,COMMA and i'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .PERIOD 
so here's the problem :COLON this is what we all want .PERIOD 
the <NUM> billion people on the planet in <NUM> want to live in places like this ,COMMA having things like this ,COMMA doing things like this ,COMMA with economies that are growing like this ,COMMA not realizing that entropy produces things like this ,COMMA this ,COMMA this and this .PERIOD 
and the question is :COLON is that what edinburgh and london and new york are going to look like in <NUM> ,COMMA or is it going to be this ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's the question .PERIOD 
i must say ,COMMA many of the indicators look like this is what it's going to look like ,COMMA but let's talk about it .PERIOD 
so my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities .PERIOD 
and scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework .PERIOD 
is that conceivable ?QUESTIONMARK 
are there universal laws ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first is :COLON are cities part of biology ?QUESTIONMARK 
is london a great big whale ?QUESTIONMARK 
is edinburgh a horse ?QUESTIONMARK 
is microsoft a great big anthill ?QUESTIONMARK 
what do we learn from that ?QUESTIONMARK 
very few cities fail .PERIOD 
all companies die ,COMMA all companies .PERIOD 
and if you have a serious theory ,COMMA you should be able to predict when google is going to go bust .PERIOD 
so is that just another version of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well we understand this very well .PERIOD 
that is ,COMMA you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size ,COMMA how many branches of a given size does a tree have ,COMMA how many leaves ,COMMA what is the energy flowing through each branch ,COMMA what is the size of the canopy ,COMMA what is its growth ,COMMA what is its mortality ?QUESTIONMARK 
we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions .PERIOD 
and the idea is can we do the same for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life ,COMMA is that it is scalable ,COMMA it works over an extraordinary range .PERIOD 
the same principles ,COMMA the same dynamics ,COMMA the same organization is at work in all of these ,COMMA including us ,COMMA and it can scale over a range of <NUM> million in size .PERIOD 
and that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust -- scalability .PERIOD 
we're going to discuss that in a moment more .PERIOD 
but you know ,COMMA at a local level ,COMMA you scale ;SEMICOLON everybody in this room is scaled .PERIOD 
that's called growth .PERIOD 
here's how you grew .PERIOD 
you grow very quickly and then you stop .PERIOD 
and that line there is a prediction from the same theory ,COMMA based on the same principles ,COMMA that describes that forest .PERIOD 
and here it is for the growth of a rat ,COMMA and those points on there are data points .PERIOD 
this is just the weight versus the age .PERIOD 
and you see ,COMMA it stops growing .PERIOD 
very ,COMMA very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience .PERIOD 
very ,COMMA very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm .PERIOD 
this is what we believe .PERIOD 
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us ,COMMA particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner :COLON hockey sticks .PERIOD 
this is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away ,COMMA and everybody making millions and billions of dollars .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so how do we understand this ?QUESTIONMARK 
so let's first talk about biology .PERIOD 
this is explicitly showing you how things scale ,COMMA and this is a truly remarkable graph .PERIOD 
what is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight ,COMMA your mass ,COMMA for all of us bunch of organisms .PERIOD 
and it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of <NUM> ,COMMA otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph .PERIOD 
and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line .PERIOD 
it's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms ,COMMA each subsystem ,COMMA each cell type ,COMMA each gene ,COMMA has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA despite all of that darwinian evolution and natural selection ,COMMA they've been constrained to lie on a line .PERIOD 
something else is going on .PERIOD 
before i talk about that ,COMMA i've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve ,COMMA this straight line .PERIOD 
it's three-quarters ,COMMA roughly ,COMMA which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear .PERIOD 
and here's the point of that .PERIOD 
it says that ,COMMA if it were linear ,COMMA the steepest slope ,COMMA then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy .PERIOD 
but it's sublinear ,COMMA and what that translates into is that ,COMMA if you double the size of the organism ,COMMA you actually only need <NUM> percent more energy .PERIOD 
the bigger you are systematically ,COMMA according to very well-defined rules ,COMMA less energy per capita .PERIOD 
now any physiological variable you can think of ,COMMA any life history event you can think of ,COMMA if you plot it this way ,COMMA looks like this .PERIOD 
there is an extraordinary regularity .PERIOD 
so you tell me the size of a mammal ,COMMA i can tell you at the <NUM> percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology ,COMMA life history ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and the reason for this is because of networks .PERIOD 
all of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level .PERIOD 
that's a little thing that lives inside an elephant .PERIOD 
if you take those networks ,COMMA this idea of networks ,COMMA and you apply universal principles ,COMMA mathematizable ,COMMA universal principles ,COMMA all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow ,COMMA including the description of the forest ,COMMA the description of your circulatory system ,COMMA the description within cells .PERIOD 
one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that ,COMMA systematically ,COMMA the pace of life decreases as you get bigger .PERIOD 
the question is :COLON is any of this true for cities and companies ?QUESTIONMARK 
so is london a scaled up birmingham ,COMMA which is a scaled up brighton ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc ?QUESTIONMARK 
is new york a scaled up san francisco ,COMMA which is a scaled up santa fe ?QUESTIONMARK 
don't know .PERIOD we will discuss that .PERIOD 
but they are networks ,COMMA and the most important network of cities is you .PERIOD 
cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions ,COMMA our interactions ,COMMA and the clustering and grouping of individuals .PERIOD 
here's just a symbolic picture of that .PERIOD 
and here's scaling of cities .PERIOD 
this shows that in this very simple example ,COMMA which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing .PERIOD 
there is a scaling .PERIOD 
that is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size .PERIOD 
the slope of that is less than linear .PERIOD 
there is an economy of scale .PERIOD 
less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising .PERIOD 
but here's what's surprising .PERIOD 
it scales in the same way everywhere .PERIOD 
this is just european countries ,COMMA but you do it in japan or china or colombia ,COMMA always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree .PERIOD 
and any infrastructure you look at -- whether it's the length of roads ,COMMA length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .PERIOD 
it's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on .PERIOD 
but even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities ,COMMA quantities that have no analog in biology ,COMMA that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
the top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way .PERIOD 
and the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way .PERIOD 
and what you see is a scaling phenomenon .PERIOD 
but most important in this ,COMMA the exponent ,COMMA the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate ,COMMA is bigger than one -- it's about <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
and we've looked at everything :COLON more aids cases ,COMMA flu ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA they're all plotted together .PERIOD 
just to show you what we plotted ,COMMA here is income ,COMMA gdp -- gdp of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph .PERIOD 
and you can see ,COMMA they all follow the same line .PERIOD 
and here's the statement .PERIOD 
if you double the size of a city from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA from a million to two million ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> million ,COMMA it doesn't matter ,COMMA then systematically you get a <NUM> percent increase in wages ,COMMA wealth ,COMMA number of aids cases ,COMMA number of police ,COMMA anything you can think of .PERIOD 
it goes up by <NUM> percent ,COMMA and you have a <NUM> percent savings on the infrastructure .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA no doubt ,COMMA is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .PERIOD 
because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people ,COMMA wealth ,COMMA income -- is what attracts them ,COMMA forgetting about the ugly and the bad .PERIOD 
what is the reason for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
well i don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics ,COMMA but underlying this is the social networks ,COMMA because this is a universal phenomenon .PERIOD 
this <NUM> percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- japan ,COMMA chile ,COMMA portugal ,COMMA scotland ,COMMA doesn't matter .PERIOD 
always ,COMMA all the data shows it's the same ,COMMA despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently .PERIOD 
something universal is going on .PERIOD 
the universality ,COMMA to repeat ,COMMA is us -- that we are the city .PERIOD 
and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions .PERIOD 
so there it is ,COMMA i've said it again .PERIOD 
so if it is those networks and their mathematical structure ,COMMA unlike biology ,COMMA which had sublinear scaling ,COMMA economies of scale ,COMMA you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger .PERIOD 
if it's social networks with super-linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .PERIOD 
the bigger you are ,COMMA life gets faster .PERIOD 
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .PERIOD 
on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities ,COMMA showing that increase .PERIOD 
lastly ,COMMA i want to talk about growth .PERIOD 
this is what we had in biology ,COMMA just to repeat .PERIOD 
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .PERIOD 
you grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience .PERIOD 
that would be bad for economies and cities .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super-linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation ,COMMA then indeed you get ,COMMA from the same theory ,COMMA a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA if you compare it to data ,COMMA it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .PERIOD 
but it has a terrible catch ,COMMA and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse .PERIOD 
and it's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources .PERIOD 
and how do you avoid that ?QUESTIONMARK well we've done it before .PERIOD 
what we do is ,COMMA as we grow and we approach the collapse ,COMMA a major innovation takes place and we start over again ,COMMA and we start over again as we approach the next one ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
so there's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse .PERIOD 
the catch ,COMMA however ,COMMA to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster .PERIOD 
so the image is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster ,COMMA but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .PERIOD 
we have to accelerate on a continuous basis .PERIOD 
and the question is :COLON can we ,COMMA as socio-economic beings ,COMMA avoid a heart attack ?QUESTIONMARK 
so lastly ,COMMA i'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies .PERIOD 
the top one ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is walmart on the right .PERIOD 
it's the same plot .PERIOD 
this happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees .PERIOD 
we could use sales ,COMMA anything you like .PERIOD 
and we've looked at <NUM> companies in the united states ,COMMA may i say .PERIOD 
and i'm only showing you a little bit of this .PERIOD 
what is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology ,COMMA indicating that they're dominated ,COMMA not by super-linear innovation and ideas ;SEMICOLON they become dominated by economies of scale .PERIOD 
in that interpretation ,COMMA by bureaucracy and administration ,COMMA and they do it beautifully ,COMMA may i say .PERIOD 
so if you tell me the size of some company ,COMMA some small company ,COMMA i could have predicted the size of walmart .PERIOD 
if it has this sublinear scaling ,COMMA the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth .PERIOD 
there's walmart .PERIOD doesn't look very sigmoidal .PERIOD 
that's what we like ,COMMA hockey sticks .PERIOD 
let's go up to <NUM> .PERIOD 
that red line is from the theory .PERIOD 
so if i'd have done this in <NUM> ,COMMA i could have predicted what walmart would be now .PERIOD 
and then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies .PERIOD 
there they are .PERIOD that's <NUM> companies .PERIOD 
they all start looking like hockey sticks ,COMMA they all bend over ,COMMA and they all die like you and me .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i have been teaching for a long time ,COMMA and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that i really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade .PERIOD 
she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived .PERIOD 
it was in the books ;SEMICOLON it was inside the teacher's head ;SEMICOLON and she needed to go there to get the information ,COMMA because that's how you learned .PERIOD 
fast-forward a generation :COLON this is the one-room schoolhouse ,COMMA oak grove ,COMMA where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse .PERIOD 
and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher ,COMMA stored it in the only portable memory he has ,COMMA which is inside his own head ,COMMA and take it with him ,COMMA because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world .PERIOD 
when i was a kid ,COMMA we had a set of encyclopedias at my house .PERIOD 
it was purchased the year i was born ,COMMA and it was extraordinary ,COMMA because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .PERIOD 
the information was inside my house and it was awesome .PERIOD 
this was different than either generation had experienced before ,COMMA and it changed the way i interacted with information even at just a small level .PERIOD 
but the information was closer to me .PERIOD 
i could get access to it .PERIOD 
in the time that passes between when i was a kid in high school and when i started teaching ,COMMA we really see the advent of the internet .PERIOD 
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool ,COMMA i take off from wisconsin and move to kansas ,COMMA small town kansas ,COMMA where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely ,COMMA small-town ,COMMA rural kansas school district ,COMMA where i was teaching my favorite subject ,COMMA american government .PERIOD 
my first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach american government ,COMMA loved the political system .PERIOD 
kids in the 12th grade :COLON not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system .PERIOD 
year two :COLON learned a few things -- had to change my tactic .PERIOD 
i didn't tell them what to do or how to do it .PERIOD 
i posed a problem in front of them ,COMMA which was to put on an election forum for their own community .PERIOD 
they produced fliers .PERIOD they called offices .PERIOD 
they checked schedules .PERIOD they were meeting with secretaries .PERIOD 
they produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .PERIOD 
they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well ,COMMA and really had this robust experiential learning .PERIOD 
the older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went ,COMMA oh ,COMMA there she is .PERIOD that's so cute .PERIOD she's trying to get that done .PERIOD 
she doesn't know what she's in for .PERIOD 
but i knew that the kids would show up ,COMMA and i believed it ,COMMA and i told them every week what i expected out of them .PERIOD 
and that night ,COMMA all <NUM> kids -- dressed appropriately ,COMMA doing their job ,COMMA owning it .PERIOD 
i had to just sit and watch .PERIOD 
it was theirs .PERIOD it was experiential .PERIOD it was authentic .PERIOD 
it meant something to them .PERIOD 
and they will step up .PERIOD 
from kansas ,COMMA i moved on to lovely arizona ,COMMA where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years ,COMMA this time with middle school students .PERIOD 
luckily ,COMMA i didn't have to teach them american government .PERIOD 
could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA thrilled to learn .PERIOD 
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in arizona ,COMMA was i had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school ,COMMA and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .PERIOD 
and one opportunity was we got to go and meet paul rusesabagina ,COMMA which is the gentleman that the movie hotel rwanda is based after .PERIOD 
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .PERIOD 
we could walk there .PERIOD we didn't even have to pay for the buses .PERIOD 
there was no expense cost .PERIOD perfect field trip .PERIOD 
and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive .PERIOD 
i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life ,COMMA or in their own story ,COMMA or in their own world ,COMMA that they could identify that had done a similar thing .PERIOD 
i asked them to produce a little movie about it .PERIOD 
it's the first time we'd done this .PERIOD 
nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer ,COMMA but they were into it .PERIOD and i asked them to put their own voice over it .PERIOD 
it was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves ,COMMA what they're willing to share .PERIOD 
the last question of the assignment is :COLON how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people ?QUESTIONMARK 
the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary .PERIOD 
fast-forward to pennsylvania ,COMMA where i find myself today .PERIOD 
i teach at the science leadership academy ,COMMA which is a partnership school between the franklin institute and the school district of philadelphia .PERIOD 
we are a nine through <NUM> public school ,COMMA but we do school quite differently .PERIOD 
so what do you do when the information is all around you ?QUESTIONMARK 
why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information ?QUESTIONMARK 
in philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program ,COMMA so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday ,COMMA taking them home ,COMMA getting access to information .PERIOD 
and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students ,COMMA is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .PERIOD 
we deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test ,COMMA and i am here to share with you :COLON it is not learning .PERIOD 
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask ,COMMA to tell kids to never be wrong .PERIOD 
to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn .PERIOD 
so we did this project ,COMMA and this is one of the artifacts of the project .PERIOD 
i almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .PERIOD 
my students produced these info-graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill .PERIOD 
i asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media ,COMMA and take a look at what were the interesting components of it ,COMMA and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from american history .PERIOD 
and they had certain criteria to do it .PERIOD 
they were a little uncomfortable with it ,COMMA because we'd never done this before ,COMMA and they didn't know exactly how to do it .PERIOD 
they can talk -- they're very smooth ,COMMA and they can write very ,COMMA very well ,COMMA but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them .PERIOD 
but i gave them the room to just do the thing .PERIOD 
go create .PERIOD go figure it out .PERIOD 
let's see what we can do .PERIOD 
and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint .PERIOD 
this was done in like two or three days .PERIOD 
and this is the work of the student that consistently did it .PERIOD 
and when i sat the students down ,COMMA i said ,COMMA who's got the best one ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they immediately went ,COMMA there it is .PERIOD 
didn't read anything .PERIOD there it is .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA well what makes it great ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they're like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA the design's good ,COMMA and he's using good color .PERIOD 
and there's some . .PERIOD and they went through all that we processed out loud .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA go read it .PERIOD 
and they're like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that one wasn't so awesome .PERIOD 
and then we went to another one -- it didn't have great visuals ,COMMA but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process ,COMMA because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect ,COMMA or whether or not it was what i could create .PERIOD 
and when we do another round of this in my class this year ,COMMA they will do better this time ,COMMA because learning has to include an amount of failure ,COMMA because failure is instructional in the process .PERIOD 
there are a million pictures that i could click through here ,COMMA and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning ,COMMA of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information ,COMMA but instead ,COMMA ask them what they can do with it .PERIOD 
ask them really interesting questions .PERIOD 
they will not disappoint .PERIOD 
this is robbie ,COMMA and this was his first day of voting ,COMMA and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that .PERIOD 
but this is learning too ,COMMA because we asked them to go out into real spaces .PERIOD 
the main point is that ,COMMA if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning ,COMMA empowering student voice and embracing failure ,COMMA we're missing the mark .PERIOD 
and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities ,COMMA because we won't get there with a standardized test ,COMMA and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer .PERIOD 
we know how to do this better ,COMMA and it's time to do better .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .PERIOD 
when we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in ,COMMA there are words that we just don't want to hear .PERIOD 
diabetes ,COMMA cancer ,COMMA parkinson's ,COMMA alzheimer's ,COMMA heart failure ,COMMA lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases ,COMMA for which there's relatively little that can be done .PERIOD 
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease ,COMMA why it's important ,COMMA why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn't ,COMMA and where we are clinically today ,COMMA and where we might go tomorrow ,COMMA and what some of the hurdles are .PERIOD 
and we're going to do all of that in <NUM> minutes ,COMMA i promise .PERIOD 
i want to start with this slide ,COMMA because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it .PERIOD 
it was basically a regenerative medicine issue .PERIOD 
regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .PERIOD 
it's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .PERIOD 
so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .PERIOD 
we know that if we have a damaged hip ,COMMA you can put an artificial hip in .PERIOD 
and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover .PERIOD 
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .PERIOD 
this is not regenerative medicine .PERIOD 
the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and i'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that ,COMMA we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .PERIOD 
so that at the end of the treatment ,COMMA you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .PERIOD 
very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel .PERIOD 
and this is just the same .PERIOD 
if you look back in history ,COMMA charles lindbergh ,COMMA who was better known for flying airplanes ,COMMA was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel ,COMMA one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller ,COMMA to begin to think about ,COMMA could you culture organs ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they published this book in <NUM> ,COMMA where they actually began to think about ,COMMA what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?QUESTIONMARK 
we've come a long way since then .PERIOD 
i'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on .PERIOD 
but before doing that ,COMMA what i'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you .PERIOD 
many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life ,COMMA and reducing poverty ,COMMA and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .PERIOD 
one of the challenges is that the richer we are ,COMMA the longer we live .PERIOD 
and the longer we live ,COMMA the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older .PERIOD 
this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of <NUM> .PERIOD 
why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK 
if the average age of your population is <NUM> ,COMMA then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again ,COMMA maybe a little bit of asthma .PERIOD 
if the average age in your country is <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA now the average person is looking at diabetes ,COMMA early-onset diabetes ,COMMA heart failure ,COMMA coronary artery disease -- things that are inherently more difficult to treat ,COMMA and much more expensive to treat .PERIOD 
just have a look at the demographics in the us .PERIOD here .PERIOD 
this is from the untied states of america .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA there were <NUM> workers per retiree .PERIOD 
<NUM> people who were basically outside of being really sick ,COMMA paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .PERIOD 
and this is matched in every industrialized ,COMMA wealthy country in the world .PERIOD 
how can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
and you can see that right around age <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care .PERIOD 
it's actually quite interesting .PERIOD if you do the right studies ,COMMA you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care ,COMMA plotted over your lifetime .PERIOD 
and about seven years before you're about to die ,COMMA there's a spike .PERIOD 
and you can actually -- -- we won't get into that .PERIOD 
there are very few things ,COMMA very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what i would call healthy aging .PERIOD 
i'd suggest there are four things ,COMMA and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system .PERIOD 
all those things do is change who pays .PERIOD 
they don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .PERIOD 
one thing you can do is not treat .PERIOD you can ration health care .PERIOD 
we won't talk about that anymore .PERIOD it's too depressing .PERIOD 
you can prevent .PERIOD 
obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .PERIOD 
but perhaps most interesting ,COMMA to me anyway ,COMMA and most important ,COMMA is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression ,COMMA and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom .PERIOD 
think of it in terms of diabetes ,COMMA for instance .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA with diabetes ,COMMA what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
we diagnose the disease eventually ,COMMA once it becomes symptomatic ,COMMA and then we treat the symptom for <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and we do ok .PERIOD insulin's a pretty good therapy .PERIOD 
but eventually it stops working ,COMMA and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease .PERIOD 
why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease ,COMMA perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it ,COMMA but if it worked ,COMMA we would truly be able to do something different .PERIOD 
this is a newt re-growing its limb .PERIOD 
if a newt can do this kind of thing ,COMMA why can't we ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .PERIOD 
but what we're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body ,COMMA for tissues and for organs themselves .PERIOD 
so today's reality is that if we get sick ,COMMA the message is we will treat your symptoms ,COMMA and you need to adjust to a new way of life .PERIOD 
i would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate ,COMMA but it's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation .PERIOD 
there's a limb prosthetic up here ,COMMA similar actually one on the soldier that's come back from iraq .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs .PERIOD 
imagine if instead of facing that ,COMMA they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .PERIOD 
it's a wild concept .PERIOD 
i'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .PERIOD 
but it's applicable ,COMMA again ,COMMA to every organ system .PERIOD 
how can we do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
we need to learn to speak the body's language .PERIOD 
and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus .PERIOD 
a mammalian fetus ,COMMA if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy ,COMMA will re-grow that limb .PERIOD 
so our dna has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .PERIOD 
it's a natural process ,COMMA but it is lost as we age .PERIOD 
by the time they're five ,COMMA they won't be able to do that anymore .PERIOD 
so to engage in that conversation with the body ,COMMA we need to speak the body's language .PERIOD 
and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .PERIOD 
i'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .PERIOD 
the first is cellular therapies .PERIOD 
clearly ,COMMA we heal ourselves in a natural process ,COMMA using cells to do most of the work .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body ,COMMA they may do the healing .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA we can use materials .PERIOD 
if we can invent materials ,COMMA design materials ,COMMA or extract materials from a natural environment ,COMMA then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal .PERIOD 
i'm going to show you an example of each of these ,COMMA and i'm going to start with materials .PERIOD 
steve badylak -- who's at the university of pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .PERIOD 
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig ,COMMA if you threw away all the cells ,COMMA and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active ,COMMA may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .PERIOD 
and he asked a very important question .PERIOD 
he asked the question ,COMMA if i take that material ,COMMA which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine ,COMMA and i place it somewhere else on a person's body ,COMMA would it give a tissue-specific response ,COMMA or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear ?QUESTIONMARK 
the picture i'm about to show you is a compelling picture .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down .PERIOD this is a good time to look at your feet ,COMMA check your blackberry ,COMMA do anything other than look at the screen .PERIOD 
what i'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .PERIOD 
and although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this .PERIOD 
this is the reality of diabetes .PERIOD 
i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics ,COMMA diabetic ulcers ,COMMA we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment ,COMMA which is amputation ,COMMA if you can't heal it .PERIOD 
so i'm going to put the slide up now .PERIOD it won't be up for long .PERIOD 
this is a diabetic ulcer .PERIOD it's tragic .PERIOD 
the treatment for this is amputation .PERIOD 
this is an older lady .PERIOD she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes ,COMMA and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact .PERIOD 
and this lady decided ,COMMA after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer ,COMMA that she would try this new therapy that steve invented .PERIOD 
that's what the wound looked like <NUM> weeks later .PERIOD 
that material contained only natural signals .PERIOD 
and that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before .PERIOD 
there's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- i'll let you know when you can look again .PERIOD 
if the horse was in pain ,COMMA i wouldn't show you this slide .PERIOD 
the horse just has another nostril that's developed because of a riding accident .PERIOD 
just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case ,COMMA taking that material ,COMMA turning it into a gel ,COMMA and packing that area ,COMMA and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up .PERIOD 
and if you took an ultrasound of that area ,COMMA it would look great .PERIOD 
here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached .PERIOD 
there are now <NUM> patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds .PERIOD 
could you regenerate a limb ?QUESTIONMARK 
darpa just gave steve <NUM> million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .PERIOD 
and i'll show you the <NUM> million dollar picture .PERIOD 
this is a <NUM> year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip .PERIOD 
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .PERIOD 
this is happening today .PERIOD 
this is clinically relevant today .PERIOD 
there are materials that do this .PERIOD here are the heart patches .PERIOD 
but could you go a little further ?QUESTIONMARK 
could you ,COMMA say ,COMMA instead of using material ,COMMA can i take some cells along with the material ,COMMA and remove a damaged piece of tissue ,COMMA put a bio-degradable material on there ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .PERIOD 
this was done by teruo okano at tokyo women's hospital .PERIOD 
he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .PERIOD 
now i'm going to show you cell-based regeneration .PERIOD 
and what i'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA if you're squeamish ,COMMA you don't want to watch .PERIOD 
but this one's kind of cool .PERIOD 
so this is a bypass operation ,COMMA just like what al gore had ,COMMA with a difference .PERIOD 
and i'm standing up here because at one point i'm going to show you just how early this technology is .PERIOD 
here go the stem cells ,COMMA right into the beating heart of the patient .PERIOD 
and if you look really carefully ,COMMA it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush .PERIOD 
you see the cells coming back out .PERIOD 
we need all sorts of new technology ,COMMA new devices ,COMMA to get the cells to the right place at the right time .PERIOD 
just a little bit of data ,COMMA a tiny bit of data .PERIOD 
at this time this was an n of <NUM> .PERIOD now there's an n of about <NUM> .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass ,COMMA they get a little bit better .PERIOD 
if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass ,COMMA for these particular patients ,COMMA they became asymptomatic .PERIOD 
these are now two years out .PERIOD 
the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early ,COMMA and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state .PERIOD 
this is the same procedure ,COMMA but now done minimally invasively ,COMMA with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .PERIOD 
we don't have time to go into all of those details ,COMMA but basically ,COMMA that works too .PERIOD 
you can take patients who are less sick ,COMMA and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy .PERIOD 
this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh ,COMMA along with a number of colleagues around the world .PERIOD 
they've decided that liposuction fluid ,COMMA which -- in the united states ,COMMA we have a lot of liposuction fluid .PERIOD 
it's a great source of stem cells .PERIOD 
stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .PERIOD 
out comes the liposuction fluid ,COMMA and in this case ,COMMA the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .PERIOD 
all done in the lab .PERIOD 
and i think fairly soon ,COMMA you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived ,COMMA or adipose-derived ,COMMA stem cells .PERIOD 
i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .PERIOD 
here's just one example before i close up .PERIOD 
this is equally tragic .PERIOD 
we have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army ,COMMA who have to treat the now <NUM> kids that have come back from iraq .PERIOD 
many of those patients are very severely burned .PERIOD 
and if there's anything that's been learned about burn ,COMMA it's that we don't know how to treat it .PERIOD 
everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach .PERIOD 
we make something over here ,COMMA and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound ,COMMA and we try and get the two to take .PERIOD 
in this case here ,COMMA a new ,COMMA wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at isr -- by joerg gerlach in pittsburgh .PERIOD 
and that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .PERIOD 
the gun that you see there sprays cells .PERIOD 
that's going to spray cells over that area .PERIOD 
the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment ,COMMA deliver other things as well at the same time ,COMMA and therefore we will seed that lawn ,COMMA as opposed to try the sodding approach .PERIOD 
it's a completely different way of doing it .PERIOD 
so my <NUM> minutes is up .PERIOD 
so let me finish up with some good news ,COMMA and maybe a little bit of bad news .PERIOD 
the good news is that this is happening today .PERIOD 
it's very powerful work .PERIOD 
clearly the images kind of get that across .PERIOD 
it's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary .PERIOD 
almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .PERIOD 
a number of governments ,COMMA and a number of regions ,COMMA have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .PERIOD 
the japanese government were perhaps the first ,COMMA when they decided to invest first <NUM> billion ,COMMA later another <NUM> billion in this field .PERIOD 
it's no coincidence .PERIOD 
they need this to work or their health system dies .PERIOD 
so they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .PERIOD 
the european union ,COMMA same thing .PERIOD 
china ,COMMA the same thing .PERIOD 
china just launched a national tissue-engineering center .PERIOD 
the first year budget was <NUM> million us dollars .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA for al gore to come and be in the real world as president .PERIOD 
we've had a different approach .PERIOD 
and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .PERIOD 
and i'm going to finish up with a quote ,COMMA maybe a little cheap shot ,COMMA at the director of the nih ,COMMA who's a very charming man .PERIOD 
myself and jay vacanti from harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago ,COMMA to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that <NUM> billion dollars that he's going to get next year and focus it ,COMMA in a strategic way ,COMMA to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients .PERIOD 
and at the end of a very testy meeting ,COMMA what the nih director said was ,COMMA your vision is larger than our appetite .PERIOD 
i'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision ,COMMA but together we can change his appetite .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i should tell you that when i was asked to be here ,COMMA i thought to myself that well ,COMMA it's ted .PERIOD 
and so i thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding british accent might help things a bit .PERIOD 
and then i thought no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way i really talk because ,COMMA after all ,COMMA this is the great unveiling .PERIOD 
and so i thought i'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you .PERIOD 
although many of you already know that i do speak the queen's english because i am from queens ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
but the theme of this session ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is invention .PERIOD 
and while i don't have any patents that i'm aware of ,COMMA you will be meeting a few of my inventions today .PERIOD 
i suppose it's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves .PERIOD 
we're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits ,COMMA unique developmental experiences ,COMMA geographical and historical contexts .PERIOD 
but then what ?QUESTIONMARK 
to what extent do we self-construct ,COMMA do we self-invent ?QUESTIONMARK 
how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity ?QUESTIONMARK 
like ,COMMA what if one could be anyone at any time ?QUESTIONMARK 
and so i've brought a couple of them with me .PERIOD 
and well ,COMMA they're very excited .PERIOD 
so feel free to think of this as sarah university .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD okay .PERIOD oh ,COMMA well .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA wonderful .PERIOD 
good evening everybody .PERIOD 
thank you so very much for having me here today .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD my name is lorraine levine .PERIOD 
oh my !EXCLAMATIONMARK there's so many of you .PERIOD 
hi sweetheart .PERIOD okay .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA i am here because of a young girl ,COMMA sarah jones .PERIOD 
she's a very nice ,COMMA young black girl .PERIOD 
but anyway .PERIOD 
she has me here because she puts me in her show ,COMMA what she calls her one-woman show .PERIOD 
and you know what that means ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work .PERIOD 
but i don't mind .PERIOD 
really ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD 
not only ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities .PERIOD 
there are so many celebrities running around here .PERIOD 
i saw -- glenn close i saw earlier .PERIOD i love her .PERIOD 
and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe .PERIOD 
isn't that adorable ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's lovely to know they're concerned ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and -- oh ,COMMA i saw goldie hawn .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA goldie hawn .PERIOD i love her ,COMMA too ;SEMICOLON she's wonderful .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA she's only half jewish .PERIOD 
did you know that about her ?QUESTIONMARK 
yeah .PERIOD but even so ,COMMA a wonderful talent .PERIOD 
and i -- you know ,COMMA when i saw her ,COMMA such a wonderful feeling .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA she's lovely .PERIOD 
it's such an eye-opening experience to be here .PERIOD 
you're all so responsible for this world that we live in today .PERIOD 
and you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you're all so young .PERIOD 
but i -- i also appreciate the diversity that you have here .PERIOD 
i noticed it's very multicultural .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA when you're standing up here ,COMMA you can see all the different people .PERIOD 
it's like a rainbow .PERIOD 
it's okay to say rainbow .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD 
i just -- i can't keep up with whether you can say ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the different things .PERIOD 
what are you allowed to say or not say ?QUESTIONMARK 
i just -- i don't want to offend anybody .PERIOD you know .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally ,COMMA some of you ,COMMA the architects building our brighter future .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's heartening to me .PERIOD 
even though ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA some of your presentations are horrifying ,COMMA absolutely horrifying .PERIOD 
it's true .PERIOD it's true .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA we know it's all because of the -- all the . .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i don't know how else to say it to you ,COMMA so i'll just say it my way :COLON the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the bankers and the wall street .PERIOD you know it .PERIOD 
anyway .PERIOD 
so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements .PERIOD 
thank you for all that you do .PERIOD 
and congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become ted meisters .PERIOD 
congratulations .PERIOD mazel tov .PERIOD 
hi .PERIOD hi .PERIOD 
thank you everybody .PERIOD 
i am dominican-american .PERIOD 
but i don't know if there's any other dominican people here ,COMMA but i know that juan enriquez ,COMMA he was here yesterday .PERIOD 
i'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything .PERIOD 
and i just -- you know i'm not used to doing the public speaking .PERIOD 
and whenever i get nervous i start to talk really fast .PERIOD 
nobody can understand nothing i'm saying ,COMMA which is very frustrating for me ,COMMA as you can imagine .PERIOD 
i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath .PERIOD 
but then on top of that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sarah jones told me we only have <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
so then i'm like ,COMMA should i be nervous ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because maybe it's better .PERIOD 
and i'm just trying not to panic and freak out .PERIOD so i like ,COMMA take a deep breath .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA i love everything about this .PERIOD it's amazing .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA like ,COMMA people would not believe ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA where i'm from ,COMMA that this even exists .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA like even ,COMMA i mean i love like the name ,COMMA the -- ted .PERIOD 
i mean i know it's a real person and everything ,COMMA but i'm just saying that like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i think it's very cool how it's also an acronym ,COMMA you know ,COMMA which is like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA is like very high concept and everything like that .PERIOD 
i like that .PERIOD 
and actually ,COMMA i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i'm a sophomore at college right now .PERIOD 
at my school -- actually i was part of co-founding an organization ,COMMA which is like a leadership thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like you guys ,COMMA you would really like it and everything .PERIOD 
and the organization is called da bomb ,COMMA a\and da bomb -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it's like ,COMMA da bomb ,COMMA it means like dominican -- it's an acronym -- dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i know ,COMMA see ,COMMA like the name is like a little bit long ,COMMA but with the war on terror and everything ,COMMA the dean of student activities has asked us to stop saying da bomb and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
i am a working mother ,COMMA and i also go to school full-time .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
but like even at my job -- like ,COMMA i just got promoted .PERIOD 
right now it's very exciting actually for me because i'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development -- that's my new title .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA but i think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me ,COMMA like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning .PERIOD 
and if everybody ,COMMA like all people really had access to that ,COMMA it would be a very different world out there ,COMMA as i know you know .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i think all people ,COMMA we need that ,COMMA but especially ,COMMA i look at people like me ,COMMA you know like ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA latinos -- we're about to be the majority ,COMMA in like two weeks .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm very happy that you're ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doing this kind of thing ,COMMA making the talks available online .PERIOD 
that's very good .PERIOD i love that .PERIOD 
and i just -- i love you guys .PERIOD i love ted .PERIOD 
and if you don't mind ,COMMA privately now ,COMMA in the future ,COMMA i'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology ,COMMA entertainment and dominicans .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that was noraida ,COMMA and just like lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today ,COMMA these are folks who are based on real people from my real life :COLON friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA family members .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the older lady you just met :COLON very ,COMMA very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side .PERIOD 
it's a long story ,COMMA believe me .PERIOD 
but on top of my family background ,COMMA my parents also sent me to the united nations school ,COMMA where i encountered a plethora of new characters ,COMMA including alexandre ,COMMA my french teacher ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it was beginner french ,COMMA that i am taking with her ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and it was madame bousson ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she was very [french] .PERIOD 
it was like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she was there in the class ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she was kind of typically french .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA she was very chic ,COMMA but she was very filled with ennui ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
and she would be there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA kind of talking with the class ,COMMA you know ,COMMA talking about the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the existential futility of life ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
but [german] .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA i took german for three years ,COMMA [german] ,COMMA and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class ,COMMA even in the un school .PERIOD 
the teacher ,COMMA herr schtopf ,COMMA he never discriminated .PERIOD 
never .PERIOD he always ,COMMA always treated each of us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA equally unbearably during the class .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there were the teachers and then there were my friends ,COMMA classmates from everywhere ,COMMA many of whom are still dear friends to this day .PERIOD 
and they've inspired many characters as well .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA a friend of mine .PERIOD 
my name is praveen manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA ted ,COMMA the reputation precedes itself all over the world .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i am originally from india ,COMMA and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california ,COMMA originally ,COMMA i was very pleased and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA relieved because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i am a human rights advocate .PERIOD 
and usually my work ,COMMA it takes me to washington dc .PERIOD 
and there ,COMMA i must attend these meetings ,COMMA mingling with some tiresome politicians ,COMMA trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you can just imagine -- right .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA but i'm thrilled to be joining all of you here .PERIOD 
i wish we had more time together ,COMMA but that's for another time .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK great .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA i don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought ,COMMA but -- i'm trying to behave myself ,COMMA it's my first time here .PERIOD 
but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize ,COMMA if you saw bridge and tunnel .PERIOD 
uh ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
good evening .PERIOD 
my name is pauline ning ,COMMA and first i want to tell you that i'm -- of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york .PERIOD 
but then ,COMMA i decided ,COMMA just like governor arnold schwarzenegger ,COMMA i try anyway .PERIOD 
my daughter -- my daughter wrote that ,COMMA she told me ,COMMA always start your speech with humor .PERIOD 
but my background -- i want to tell you story only briefly .PERIOD 
my husband and i ,COMMA we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we cannot have in china at that time .PERIOD 
and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition ,COMMA but it's very hard .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA as immigrant ,COMMA i would speak chinese to them ,COMMA and they would always answer me back in english .PERIOD 
they love rock music ,COMMA pop culture ,COMMA american culture .PERIOD 
but when they got older ,COMMA when the time comes for them to start think about getting married ,COMMA that's when we expect them to realize ,COMMA a little bit more ,COMMA their own culture .PERIOD 
my son ,COMMA he says he is not ready to get married .PERIOD 
and he has a sweetheart ,COMMA but she is american woman ,COMMA not chinese .PERIOD 
it's not that it's bad ,COMMA but i told him ,COMMA what's wrong with a chinese woman ?QUESTIONMARK 
but i think he will change his mind soon .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA then i decide instead ,COMMA i will concentrate on my daughter .PERIOD 
but first ,COMMA she said she's not interested .PERIOD 
she only wants to spend time with her friends .PERIOD 
and then at college ,COMMA it's like she never came home .PERIOD 
and she doesn't want me to come and visit .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA what's wrong in this picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA i accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend .PERIOD 
but she told me ,COMMA mom ,COMMA you don't have to worry about boys because i don't like them .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA no mom .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i don't like boys .PERIOD i like girls .PERIOD 
i am lesbian .PERIOD 
but she told me ,COMMA mom ,COMMA it's not american .PERIOD 
she said she is in love -- in love with a nice chinese girl .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are the words i am waiting to hear ,COMMA but from my son ,COMMA not my daughter .PERIOD 
but at first i did not know what to do .PERIOD 
but then ,COMMA over time ,COMMA i have come to understand that this is who she is .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA even though sometimes it's still hard ,COMMA i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant ,COMMA usually because of places like this ,COMMA because of ideas like this ,COMMA and people like you ,COMMA with an open mind .PERIOD 
so i think maybe ted ,COMMA you impact people's lives in the ways maybe even you don't realize .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA for my daughter's sake ,COMMA i thank you for your ideas worth spreading .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD xie xie .PERIOD 
good evening .PERIOD my name is habbi belahal .PERIOD 
and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today .PERIOD 
i am originally from jordan .PERIOD 
and i teach comparative literature at queens college .PERIOD 
it is not harvard .PERIOD 
but i feel a bit like a fish out of water .PERIOD 
but i am very proud of my students .PERIOD 
and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference .PERIOD 
so you will get the extra credit i promised you .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA while i know that i may not look like the typical ted-izen ,COMMA as you would say ,COMMA i do like to make the point that we in global society ,COMMA we are never as different as the appearances may suggest .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you will indulge me ,COMMA i will share quickly with you a bit of verse ,COMMA which i memorized as a young girl at <NUM> years of age .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA back in the ancient times .PERIOD 
[arabic] and this roughly translates :COLON please ,COMMA let me hold your hand .PERIOD 
i want to hold your hand .PERIOD 
i want to hold your hand .PERIOD 
and when i touch you ,COMMA i feel happy inside .PERIOD 
it's such a feeling that my love ,COMMA i can't hide ,COMMA i can't hide ,COMMA i can't hide .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA so okay ,COMMA but please ,COMMA please ,COMMA but please .PERIOD 
if it is sounding familiar ,COMMA it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles .PERIOD 
on the radio [unclear] ,COMMA they were very popular .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another ,COMMA there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme .PERIOD 
and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent ,COMMA in time .PERIOD 
that's all ,COMMA shukran .PERIOD thank you very much for the opportunity .PERIOD 
okay ?QUESTIONMARK great .PERIOD 
thank you all very much .PERIOD it was lovely .PERIOD 
thank you for having me .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you have to let me say this .PERIOD 
i just -- thank you .PERIOD 
i want to thank chris and jacqueline ,COMMA and just everyone for having me here .PERIOD 
it's been a long time coming ,COMMA and i feel like i'm home .PERIOD 
and i know i've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere ,COMMA but this is honestly one of the best audiences i've ever experienced .PERIOD 
the whole thing is amazing ,COMMA and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon .PERIOD 
just to put everything in context ,COMMA and to kind of give you a background to where i'm coming from ,COMMA so that a lot of the things i'm going to say ,COMMA and the things i'm going to do -- or things i'm going to tell you i've done -- you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to be where i am .PERIOD 
i graduated high school in cleveland ,COMMA ohio ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad ,COMMA we went back home .PERIOD 
and by the time i was an intern house officer ,COMMA i could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor .PERIOD 
this brings us to why a lot of us ,COMMA who are professionals ,COMMA are now ,COMMA as they say ,COMMA in diaspora .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA are we going to make that a permanent thing ,COMMA where we all get trained ,COMMA and we leave ,COMMA and we don't go back ?QUESTIONMARK 
perhaps not ,COMMA i should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA for good measure ,COMMA that's where nigeria is on the african map ,COMMA and just there is the delta region that i'm sure everybody's heard of .PERIOD 
people getting kidnapped ,COMMA where the oil comes from ,COMMA the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria .PERIOD 
very interesting .PERIOD 
how many people do you think are on that taxi ?QUESTIONMARK 
and believe it or not ,COMMA that is a taxi in nigeria .PERIOD 
and the capital -- well ,COMMA what used to be the capital of nigeria -- lagos ,COMMA that's a taxi ,COMMA and you have police on them .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA tell me ,COMMA how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ?QUESTIONMARK and now ?QUESTIONMARK three .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when these kind of people -- and ,COMMA believe me ,COMMA it's not just the police that use these taxis in lagos .PERIOD we all do .PERIOD i've been on one of these ,COMMA and i didn't have a helmet ,COMMA either .PERIOD 
and it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off ,COMMA has an accident and needs a hospital .PERIOD 
believe it or not ,COMMA some of us do survive .PERIOD 
some of us do survive malaria ;SEMICOLON we do survive aids .PERIOD 
and like i tell my family ,COMMA and my wife reminds me every time ,COMMA you're risking your life ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time you go to that country .PERIOD 
and she's right .PERIOD every time you go there ,COMMA you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many ,COMMA there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go ?QUESTIONMARK 
where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm not saying instead of ,COMMA i'm saying as well as ,COMMA aids ,COMMA tb ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA typhoid -- the list goes on .PERIOD 
i'm saying ,COMMA where do they go when they're like me ?QUESTIONMARK 
when i go back home -- and i do all kinds of things ,COMMA i teach ,COMMA i train -- but i catch one of these things ,COMMA or i'm chronically ill with one of those ,COMMA where do they go ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think it's quite significant .PERIOD this is where they go .PERIOD 
these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA it's from a major teaching hospital in nigeria .PERIOD 
now that is less than a year old ,COMMA in an operating room .PERIOD 
that's sterilizing equipment in nigeria .PERIOD 
you remember all that oil ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can say some of this is education .PERIOD 
you can say it's hygiene .PERIOD i'm not pleading poverty .PERIOD 
i'm saying we need more than just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA vaccination ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA aids ,COMMA because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA when i start running around saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA boys and girls ,COMMA you're cardiologists in the us ,COMMA can you come home with me and do a mission ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want them to think ,COMMA well there's some hope .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA have a look at that .PERIOD that's the anesthesiology machine .PERIOD 
and that's my specialty ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag .PERIOD 
it's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the uk .PERIOD 
and believe me ,COMMA these are current pictures .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if something like this ,COMMA which has happened in the uk ,COMMA that's where they go .PERIOD this is the intensive care unit in which i work .PERIOD 
all right ,COMMA this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria ,COMMA and jokingly we refer to it as expensive scare .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are the problems .PERIOD 
there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are ,COMMA are there ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think we all know .PERIOD and several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems .PERIOD 
these are a few of them .PERIOD so ,COMMA what did i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
there we go -- we're going on a mission .PERIOD 
we're going to do some open-heart surgery .PERIOD i was the only brit ,COMMA on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons ,COMMA cardiac nurse ,COMMA intensive care nurse .PERIOD 
we all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far .PERIOD 
just so you know ,COMMA i do believe in missions ,COMMA i do believe in aid and i do believe in charity .PERIOD they have their place ,COMMA but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier ?QUESTIONMARK 
because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission .PERIOD 
health is wealth ,COMMA in the words of hans rosling .PERIOD 
you get wealthier faster if you are healthy first .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here we are ,COMMA mission .PERIOD big trouble .PERIOD 
open-heart surgery in nigeria -- big trouble .PERIOD 
does he look like he's happy ?QUESTIONMARK 
it took us two days just to organize the place ,COMMA but hey ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we worked on it .PERIOD does he look happy ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ,COMMA that's the medical advice the committee chairman says ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i told you ,COMMA you weren't going to be able to ,COMMA you can't do this ,COMMA i just know it .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA that's the technician we had .PERIOD so yes ,COMMA you go on ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
i got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the uk .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA let's just go work this thing out .PERIOD 
we get a lot of donated equipment .PERIOD 
equipment that's obsolete ,COMMA equipment that doesn't quite work ,COMMA or it works and you can't fix it .PERIOD and there's nothing wrong with that ,COMMA so long as we use it and we move on .PERIOD 
but we had problems with it .PERIOD we had severe problems there .PERIOD 
he had to get on the phone .PERIOD this guy was always on the phone .PERIOD 
so what we going to do now ?QUESTIONMARK 
the reason i have this picture here ,COMMA this x-ray ,COMMA it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing x-rays .PERIOD 
do you figure where that is ?QUESTIONMARK it was on a window .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA what's an x-ray viewing box ?QUESTIONMARK please .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA nowadays everything's on pax anyway .PERIOD 
you look at your x-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them ,COMMA you email them .PERIOD but we were still using x-rays ,COMMA but we didn't even have a viewing box !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and we were doing open-heart surgery .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA i know it's not aids ,COMMA i know it's not malaria ,COMMA but we still need this stuff .PERIOD oh yeah ,COMMA echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready .PERIOD 
people still believe in voodoo .PERIOD heart disease ,COMMA vsd ,COMMA hole in the heart ,COMMA tetralogies .PERIOD 
you still get people who believe in it and they came .PERIOD 
at <NUM> percent oxygen saturation ,COMMA the normal is about <NUM> .PERIOD 
her condition ,COMMA open-heart surgery that as she required ,COMMA would have been treated when she was a child .PERIOD 
we had to do these for adults .PERIOD so ,COMMA we did succeed and we still do .PERIOD 
we've done three .PERIOD we're planning another one in july in the north of the country .PERIOD so ,COMMA we certainly still do open-heart ,COMMA but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything ,COMMA instruments .PERIOD we had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it .PERIOD 
the oxygen tanks didn't quite work right .PERIOD 
but how many did we do the first one ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
we did <NUM> open-heart surgical patients successfully .PERIOD 
here is our very first patient ,COMMA out of intensive care ,COMMA and just watch that chair ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is what i mean about appropriate technology .PERIOD 
that's what he was doing ,COMMA propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work .PERIOD 
have you seen one of those before ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm sure you've all seen or heard this before :COLON we ,COMMA the willing ,COMMA have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD sustainable solutions -- this was my first company .PERIOD 
this one's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we put my hand in my pocket and say ,COMMA guys ,COMMA let's just buy stuff .PERIOD 
let's go set up a company that teaches people ,COMMA educates them ,COMMA gives them the tools they need to keep going .PERIOD 
and that's a perfect example of one .PERIOD 
usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital ,COMMA you buy a different one for children ,COMMA you buy a different one for transport .PERIOD this one will do everything ,COMMA and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air .PERIOD 
if you're in america and you don't know about this one ,COMMA we do ,COMMA because we make it our duty to find out what's appropriate technology for africa -- what's appropriately priced ,COMMA does the job ,COMMA and we move on .PERIOD anesthesia machine :COLON multi-parameter monitor ,COMMA operating lights ,COMMA suction .PERIOD 
this little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car ,COMMA that charges your ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA game boy ,COMMA telephone ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's exactly how the outlets are designed .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA it will take a solar panel .PERIOD yes a solar panel will charge it .PERIOD 
but if you've got mains as well ,COMMA it will charge the batteries in there .PERIOD 
and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK we have a little pedal charger too ,COMMA just in case .PERIOD 
and guess what ,COMMA if it all fails ,COMMA if you can find a car that's still got a live battery and you stick it in ,COMMA it will still work .PERIOD then you can customize it .PERIOD 
is it dental surgery you want ?QUESTIONMARK general surgery you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
decide which instruments ,COMMA stock it up with consumables .PERIOD 
the technology for oxygen delivery is not new .PERIOD 
oxygen concentrators are very old technology .PERIOD what is new ,COMMA and what we will have in a few months ,COMMA i hope ,COMMA is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site .PERIOD zeolite -- it's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is <NUM> percent of air .PERIOD 
if you take nitrogen out ,COMMA what's left ?QUESTIONMARK oxygen ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD 
these are the basic features of my device ,COMMA or our device .PERIOD 
this is what makes it so special .PERIOD 
apart from the awards it's won ,COMMA it's portable and it's certified .PERIOD it's registered ,COMMA the mhra -- and the ce mark ,COMMA for those who don't know ,COMMA for europe ,COMMA is the equivalent of the fda in the us .PERIOD 
if you compare it with what's on the market ,COMMA price-wise ,COMMA size-wise ,COMMA ease of use ,COMMA complexity . .PERIOD 
this picture was taken last year .PERIOD 
it was in this gentleman's house in the potomac ,COMMA for those of you who are familiar with maryland .PERIOD 
there are too many of us outside and everybody ,COMMA just to borrow a bit from hans -- hans rosling ,COMMA he's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention ,COMMA it's the problems .PERIOD but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa -- looking at the culture ,COMMA looking at the people ,COMMA looking at how much money they've got .PERIOD 
african people ,COMMA because they will do it with a passion ,COMMA i hope .PERIOD 
and lots and lots of that little bit down there ,COMMA sacrifice .PERIOD 
you have to do it .PERIOD africans have to do it ,COMMA in conjunction with everyone else .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from ted for years .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA i was ready to talk about ebay ,COMMA but no call .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i was ready to do a talk about the skoll foundation and social entrepreneurship .PERIOD no call .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i started participant productions and we had a really good first year ,COMMA and no call .PERIOD 
you've got a cruel sense of humor ,COMMA ted .PERIOD 
when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley ,COMMA i had some misgivings .PERIOD 
but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA some advantages to owning your own media company .PERIOD 
and i also found that hollywood and silicon valley have a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .PERIOD 
hollywood has its sex symbols ,COMMA and the valley has its sex symbols .PERIOD 
hollywood has its rivalries ,COMMA and the valley has its rivalries .PERIOD 
so it turned out there was a lot more in common than i would have dreamed .PERIOD 
and part of it is a personal story .PERIOD when chris invited me to speak ,COMMA he said ,COMMA people think of you as a bit of an enigma ,COMMA and they want to know what drives you a bit .PERIOD 
and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share .PERIOD 
it's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .PERIOD 
and when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days ,COMMA ed wilson and the pictures of james nachtwey ,COMMA i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to call humanity <NUM> .PERIOD 
and it's also something that resides in each of us ,COMMA to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today .PERIOD 
one is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that president clinton last night called uneven ,COMMA unfair and unsustainable -- and ,COMMA out of that ,COMMA comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us .PERIOD 
but perhaps the other ,COMMA bigger gap is what we call the hope gap .PERIOD 
and someone ,COMMA at some point ,COMMA came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world .PERIOD 
and i think that's just a horrible thing .PERIOD 
and so chapter one really begins today ,COMMA with all of us ,COMMA because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps .PERIOD 
and if the men and women of ted can't make a difference in the world ,COMMA i don't know who can .PERIOD 
and for me ,COMMA a lot of this started when i was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate new york .PERIOD 
and there really wasn't much to do there for the summer ,COMMA except get beaten up by my sister or read books .PERIOD 
and so i used to read authors like james michener and james clavell and ayn rand .PERIOD 
and their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place .PERIOD 
and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected ,COMMA that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all ,COMMA and maybe engage them to make a difference .PERIOD 
i didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living ,COMMA so i decided to go on a path to become financially independent ,COMMA so i could write these stories as quickly as i could .PERIOD 
i then had a bit of a wake-up call when i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
and my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer ,COMMA and it looked pretty bad .PERIOD 
and knock on wood ,COMMA he's still alive today ,COMMA many years later .PERIOD 
but for a young man that made a real impression on me ,COMMA that one never knows how much time one really has .PERIOD 
so i set out in a hurry .PERIOD i studied engineering .PERIOD 
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .PERIOD 
one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move ,COMMA which is very well named ,COMMA because people kept stealing the computers .PERIOD 
so i figured i needed to learn a little bit more about business ,COMMA so i went to stanford business school and studied there .PERIOD 
and while i was there ,COMMA i made friends with a fellow named pierre omidyar ,COMMA who is here today .PERIOD and pierre ,COMMA i apologize for this .PERIOD this is a photo from the old days .PERIOD 
and just after i'd graduated ,COMMA pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other .PERIOD 
and with the wisdom of my stanford degree ,COMMA i said ,COMMA pierre ,COMMA what a stupid idea .PERIOD 
and needless to say ,COMMA i was right .PERIOD 
but right after that ,COMMA pierre -- in '<NUM> ,COMMA pierre and i left our full-time jobs to build ebay as a company .PERIOD and the rest of that story ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
the company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world .PERIOD 
hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and i wanted to figure out how i could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world .PERIOD 
and around that time ,COMMA i met john gardner ,COMMA who is a remarkable man .PERIOD 
he was the architect of the great society programs under lyndon johnson in the 1960s .PERIOD 
and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do ,COMMA or anyone could do ,COMMA to make a difference in the long-term issues facing humanity .PERIOD 
and john said ,COMMA bet on good people doing good things .PERIOD 
bet on good people doing good things .PERIOD 
and that really resonated with me .PERIOD 
i started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things .PERIOD 
these leading ,COMMA innovative ,COMMA nonprofit folks ,COMMA who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems .PERIOD 
people today we call social entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
and to put a face on it ,COMMA people like muhammad yunus ,COMMA who started the grameen bank ,COMMA has lifted <NUM> million people plus out of poverty around the world ,COMMA won the nobel peace prize .PERIOD 
but there's also a lot of people that you don't know .PERIOD 
folks like ann cotton ,COMMA who started a group called camfed in africa ,COMMA because she felt girls' education was lagging .PERIOD 
and she started it about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and today ,COMMA she educates over a quarter million african girls .PERIOD 
and somebody like dr .PERIOD victoria hale ,COMMA who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company ,COMMA and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis ,COMMA also known as black fever .PERIOD 
and by <NUM> ,COMMA she hopes to eliminate this disease ,COMMA which is really a scourge in the developing world .PERIOD 
and so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things .PERIOD 
and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really is powerful .PERIOD 
it's what we call ,COMMA invest ,COMMA connect and celebrate .PERIOD 
and invest :COLON if you see good people doing good things ,COMMA invest in them .PERIOD invest in their organizations ,COMMA or in business .PERIOD invest in these folks .PERIOD 
and celebrate them :COLON tell their stories ,COMMA because not only are there good people doing good work ,COMMA but their stories can help close these gaps of hope .PERIOD 
and it was this last part of the mission ,COMMA the celebrate part ,COMMA that really got me back to thinking when i was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all .PERIOD 
and a light bulb went off ,COMMA which was ,COMMA first ,COMMA that i didn't actually have to do the writing myself ,COMMA i could find writers .PERIOD 
and then the next light bulb was ,COMMA better than just writing ,COMMA what about film and tv ,COMMA to get out to people in a big way ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i thought about the films that inspired me ,COMMA films like gandhi and schindler's list .PERIOD 
and i wondered who was doing these kinds of films today .PERIOD 
and there really wasn't a specific company that was focused on the public interest .PERIOD 
and then of course ,COMMA there was the other adage .PERIOD 
the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business .PERIOD 
undeterred ,COMMA in january of <NUM> ,COMMA i started participant productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest .PERIOD 
and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change .PERIOD 
and we don't just want people to see our movies and say ,COMMA that was fun ,COMMA and forget about it .PERIOD 
we want them to actually get involved in the issues .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA we launched our first slate of films ,COMMA murder ball ,COMMA north country ,COMMA syriana and good night and good luck .PERIOD 
and much to my surprise ,COMMA they were noticed .PERIOD 
we ended up with <NUM> oscar nominations for these films .PERIOD 
and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy .PERIOD 
perhaps more importantly ,COMMA tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies .PERIOD 
and we had an online component of that ,COMMA our community sect called participatenet .PERIOD 
but with our social sector partners ,COMMA like the aclu and pbs and the sierra club and the nrdc ,COMMA once people saw the film ,COMMA there was actually something they could do to make a difference .PERIOD 
but it was a film that starred charlize theron and it was about women's rights ,COMMA women's empowerment ,COMMA domestic violence and so on .PERIOD 
and we released the film at the same time that the congress was debating the renewal of the violence against women act .PERIOD 
and with screenings on the hill ,COMMA and discussions ,COMMA and with our social sector partners ,COMMA like the national organization of women ,COMMA the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act .PERIOD 
and then the movie about this person doing these things ,COMMA then led to this greater renewal .PERIOD 
and so again ,COMMA it goes back to betting on good people doing good things .PERIOD 
speaking of which ,COMMA our fellow tedster ,COMMA al -- i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming in may of <NUM> .PERIOD 
i thought it was a <NUM> to <NUM> year problem .PERIOD 
and after we saw his slide show ,COMMA it became clear that it was much more urgent .PERIOD 
and so right afterwards ,COMMA i met backstage with al ,COMMA and with lawrence bender ,COMMA who was there ,COMMA and laurie david ,COMMA and davis guggenheim ,COMMA who was running documentaries for participant at the time .PERIOD 
and with al's blessing ,COMMA we decided on the spot to turn it into a film ,COMMA because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having al go around the world ,COMMA speaking to audiences of <NUM> or <NUM> at a time .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA there's another adage in hollywood ,COMMA that nobody knows nothing about anything .PERIOD 
and i really thought this was going to be a straight-to-pbs charitable initiative .PERIOD 
and so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest ,COMMA and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland ,COMMA and most of scandinavia .PERIOD 
we've sent <NUM> dvds to high school teachers in the us .PERIOD 
and it's really changed the debate on global warming .PERIOD 
it was also a pretty good year for this guy .PERIOD 
we now call al the george clooney of global warming .PERIOD 
and for participant ,COMMA this is just the start .PERIOD 
everything we do looks at the major issues in the world .PERIOD 
i'll quickly talk about a few coming up .PERIOD 
one is charlie wilson's war ,COMMA with tom hanks and julia roberts .PERIOD 
and it's the true story of congressman charlie wilson ,COMMA and how he funded the taliban to fight the russians in afghanistan .PERIOD 
and we're also doing a movie called the kite runner ,COMMA based on the book the kite runner ,COMMA also about afghanistan .PERIOD 
and we think once people see these films ,COMMA they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the middle east in general .PERIOD 
we premiered a film called the chicago <NUM> at sundance this year .PERIOD 
it's based on the protesters at the democratic convention in <NUM> ,COMMA abby hoffman and crew ,COMMA and ,COMMA again ,COMMA a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world .PERIOD 
and a documentary that we're doing on jimmy carter and his mid-east peace efforts over the years .PERIOD 
and in particular ,COMMA we've been following him on his recent book tour ,COMMA which ,COMMA as many of you know ,COMMA has been very non-controversial -- -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie .PERIOD 
in closing ,COMMA i'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way .PERIOD 
and all the people in this room have done so through their business lives ,COMMA or their philanthropic work ,COMMA or their other interests .PERIOD 
one can do it as a tech person ,COMMA or as a finance person ,COMMA or a nonprofit person ,COMMA or as an entertainment person ,COMMA but every one of us is all of those things and more .PERIOD 
and i believe if we do these things ,COMMA we can close the opportunity gaps ,COMMA we can close the hope gaps .PERIOD 
and i like this one ,COMMA snow has returned to kilimanjaro .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA an ebay listing for one well-traveled slide show ,COMMA now obsolete ,COMMA museum piece .PERIOD please contact al gore .PERIOD 
and i want to thank you all for having me here today .PERIOD 
it's been a real honor .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
i'm going to share with you the story as to how i have become an hiv/aids campaigner .PERIOD 
and this is the name of my campaign :COLON sing campaign .PERIOD 
in november of <NUM> ,COMMA i was invited to take part in the launch of nelson mandela's <NUM> foundation -- that is his hiv/aids foundation .PERIOD 
and <NUM> is the number that mandela had when he was imprisoned in robben island .PERIOD 
and that's me with youssou n'dour ,COMMA onstage ,COMMA having the time of my life .PERIOD 
you can see the bars of the window there .PERIOD 
it was quite a momentous occasion for all of us .PERIOD 
in that moment in time ,COMMA mandela told the world's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ;SEMICOLON that post-apartheid rainbow nation ,COMMA a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims ,COMMA the most vulnerable of all ,COMMA were women and children .PERIOD 
this was a huge impact on my mind ,COMMA because i am a woman and i am a mother ,COMMA and i hadn't realized that the hiv/aids pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way .PERIOD 
and so i committed -- when i left south africa ,COMMA when i left capetown ,COMMA i told myself ,COMMA this is going to be something that i have to talk about .PERIOD 
i have to serve .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA subsequently i participated in every single <NUM> event that i could take part in and gave news conferences ,COMMA interviews ,COMMA talking and using my platform as a musician ,COMMA with my commitment to mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous ,COMMA unbelievable work that he had done .PERIOD 
everyone in the world respects nelson mandela ,COMMA everyone reveres nelson mandela .PERIOD 
but do they all know about what has been taking place in south africa ,COMMA his country ,COMMA the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think that if i went out into the street now and i told people what was happening there ,COMMA they would be shocked .PERIOD 
i was very ,COMMA very fortunate a couple of years later to have met zackie achmat ,COMMA the founder of treatment action campaign ,COMMA an incredible campaigner and activist .PERIOD 
i met him at a <NUM> event .PERIOD 
this is a tool -- this tells you i am in solidarity with people who have hiv ,COMMA people who are living with hiv .PERIOD 
and in a way because of the stigma ,COMMA by wearing this t-shirt i say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we can talk about this issue .PERIOD 
it doesn't have to be in the closet .PERIOD 
i became a member of treatment action campaign and i'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .PERIOD 
it's a grassroots campaign with <NUM> percent membership being women ,COMMA most of whom are hiv-positive .PERIOD 
they work in the field .PERIOD 
they have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus .PERIOD 
they have education programs .PERIOD 
they bring out the issues of stigma .PERIOD 
it's quite extraordinary what they do .PERIOD 
and yes ,COMMA my sing campaign has supported treatment action campaign in the way that i have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds .PERIOD 
a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do ,COMMA and are still continuing to do in south africa .PERIOD 
so this is my sing campaign .PERIOD 
sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me .PERIOD 
i've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about <NUM> different countries .PERIOD 
here i am in oslo in norway ,COMMA getting a nice ,COMMA fat check ;SEMICOLON singing in hong kong ,COMMA trying to get people to raise money .PERIOD 
in johannesburg ,COMMA i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white ,COMMA middle-class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart ,COMMA the whole nature ,COMMA of this terrible tragedy that is taking place ,COMMA that people are tending to avoid ,COMMA because they are fatigued ,COMMA and they really don't quite know what the solutions are .PERIOD 
aaron motsoaledi ,COMMA the current health minister ,COMMA attended that concert and i had an opportunity to meet with him ,COMMA and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change ,COMMA which is absolutely necessary .PERIOD 
this is in the scottish parliament .PERIOD 
and i was showing them my experiences and trying to ,COMMA again ,COMMA raise awareness .PERIOD 
and once again ,COMMA in edinburgh with the wonderful african children's choir who i simply adore .PERIOD 
and it's children like this ,COMMA many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the aids virus .PERIOD 
i'm sitting here in new york with michel sidibe -- he's the director of unaids .PERIOD 
and i'm very honored by the fact that michel invited me ,COMMA only a few months ago ,COMMA to become a unaids ambassador .PERIOD 
and in this way ,COMMA i've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach .PERIOD 
the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by <NUM> .PERIOD 
it's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will .PERIOD 
this can happen .PERIOD 
and here i am with a pregnant woman ,COMMA who is hiv positive and we're smiling ,COMMA both of us are smiling ,COMMA because we're very confident ,COMMA because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to .PERIOD 
and her baby will receive pmtct ,COMMA which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus .PERIOD 
now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .PERIOD 
it's one way to start looking at intervention with the aids pandemic .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about avelile .PERIOD 
this is avelile -- she goes with me wherever i go .PERIOD 
avelile's mother had hiv virus -- she died from aids-related illness .PERIOD 
avelile had the virus ,COMMA she was born with the virus .PERIOD 
and here she is at seven years old ,COMMA weighing no more than a one year-old baby .PERIOD 
at this point in her life ,COMMA she's suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .PERIOD 
we met her in a hospital in the eastern cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child .PERIOD 
the doctors and nurses were phenomenal .PERIOD 
they put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her .PERIOD 
and we didn't know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience ,COMMA this one child ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that story .PERIOD 
five months later ,COMMA we went back to south africa to meet avelile again .PERIOD 
and i'm getting -- the hairs on my -- i don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms .PERIOD 
they're standing up because i know what i'm going to show you .PERIOD 
this is the transformation that took place .PERIOD 
isn't it extraordinary ?QUESTIONMARK 
that round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of avelile .PERIOD 
and i take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i would like to say to you ,COMMA each one in the audience ,COMMA if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care ,COMMA and you believe that the millennium development goals ,COMMA specifically five and six ,COMMA should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub-saharan africa -- could you please stand up .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so i begin with an advertisement inspired by george orwell that apple ran in <NUM> .PERIOD 
big brother :COLON we are one people with one will ,COMMA one resolve ,COMMA one cause .PERIOD 
our enemies shall talk themselves to death ,COMMA and we will fight them with their own confusion .PERIOD 
we shall prevail .PERIOD 
narrator :COLON on january 24th ,COMMA apple computer will introduce macintosh .PERIOD 
and you'll see why <NUM> won't be like <NUM> .PERIOD 
rebecca mackinnon :COLON so the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today .PERIOD 
technology created by innovative companies will set us all free .PERIOD 
fast-forward more than two decades :COLON apple launches the iphone in china and censors the dalai lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the chinese government for its chinese app store .PERIOD 
the american political cartoonist mark fiore also had his satire application censored in the united states because some of apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups .PERIOD 
his app wasn't reinstated until he won the pulitzer prize .PERIOD 
the german magazine stern ,COMMA a news magazine ,COMMA had its app censored because the apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users ,COMMA and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout germany .PERIOD 
and more controversially ,COMMA recently ,COMMA apple censored a palestinian protest app after the israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks .PERIOD 
so here's the thing .PERIOD 
we have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies .PERIOD 
or they're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed .PERIOD 
or they're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many ,COMMA or most ,COMMA of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .PERIOD 
so here's the situation .PERIOD 
in a pre-internet world ,COMMA sovereignty over our physical freedoms ,COMMA or lack thereof ,COMMA was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .PERIOD 
and their sovereignties ,COMMA cross-cutting ,COMMA globally interlinked ,COMMA can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways ,COMMA but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year .PERIOD 
and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond .PERIOD 
as wael ghonim ,COMMA the google-egyptian-executive by day ,COMMA secret-facebook-activist by night ,COMMA famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down ,COMMA if you want to liberate a society ,COMMA just give them the internet .PERIOD 
but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .PERIOD 
on the left there's a photo taken by an egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the egyptian state security offices in march .PERIOD 
and many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles .PERIOD 
but some of the files were left behind intact ,COMMA and activists ,COMMA some of them ,COMMA found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges ,COMMA their cellphone text message exchanges ,COMMA even skype conversations .PERIOD 
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces .PERIOD 
and egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there .PERIOD 
and in tunisia ,COMMA censorship actually began to return in may -- not nearly as extensively as under president ben ali .PERIOD 
but you'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .PERIOD 
in protest over this ,COMMA blogger slim amamou ,COMMA who had been jailed under ben ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution ,COMMA he resigned in protest from the cabinet .PERIOD 
but there's been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA on twitter ,COMMA there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said ,COMMA well actually ,COMMA we do want democracy and free expression ,COMMA but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy .PERIOD 
but the problem is ,COMMA how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power ?QUESTIONMARK 
as riadh guerfali ,COMMA the veteran digital activist from tunisia ,COMMA remarked over this incident ,COMMA before ,COMMA things were simple :COLON you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA things are a lot more subtle .PERIOD 
welcome to democracy ,COMMA our tunisian and egyptian friends .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA in the united states ,COMMA whatever you may think of julian assange ,COMMA even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks .PERIOD 
amazon webhosting dropped wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from us .PERIOD senator joe lieberman ,COMMA despite the fact that wikileaks had not been charged ,COMMA let alone convicted ,COMMA of any crime .PERIOD 
so we assume that the internet is a border-busting technology .PERIOD 
but borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace .PERIOD 
in brazil and japan ,COMMA it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons .PERIOD 
but if you look at china ,COMMA vietnam and a number of the former soviet states ,COMMA what's happening there is more troubling .PERIOD 
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government .PERIOD 
now in china ,COMMA you have the great firewall ,COMMA as it's well-known ,COMMA that blocks facebook and twitter and now google+ and many of the other overseas websites .PERIOD 
and that's done in part with the help from western technology .PERIOD 
but that's only half of the story .PERIOD 
the other part of the story are requirements that the chinese government places on all companies operating on the chinese internet ,COMMA known as a system of self-discipline .PERIOD 
and this is a ceremony i actually attended in <NUM> where the internet society of china presented awards to the top <NUM> chinese companies that are best at exercising self-discipline -- ie .PERIOD policing their content .PERIOD 
and robin li ,COMMA ceo of baidu ,COMMA china's dominant search engine ,COMMA was one of the recipients .PERIOD 
in russia ,COMMA they do not generally block the internet and directly censor websites .PERIOD 
but this is a website called rospil that's an anti-corruption site .PERIOD 
and earlier this year ,COMMA there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at yandex money .PERIOD 
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet ,COMMA which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .PERIOD 
so the important question ,COMMA i think ,COMMA is not this debate over whether the internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .PERIOD 
the most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the internet evolves in a citizen-centric manner .PERIOD 
because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens ,COMMA and i would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives ,COMMA not to manipulate or enslave us .PERIOD 
so the question is ,COMMA we know how to hold government accountable .PERIOD 
we don't necessarily always do it very well ,COMMA but we have a sense of what the models are ,COMMA politically and institutionally ,COMMA to do that .PERIOD 
how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ?QUESTIONMARK 
and government regulation often isn't helping all that much .PERIOD 
you have situations ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA in france where president sarkozy tells the ceo's of internet companies ,COMMA we're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest .PERIOD 
but then he goes and champions laws like the infamous three-strikes law that would disconnect citizens from the internet for file sharing ,COMMA which has been condemned by the un .PERIOD special rapporteur on freedom of expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens' right to communications ,COMMA and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens .PERIOD 
and here in the united kingdom there's also concern over a law called the digital economy act that's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior .PERIOD 
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future ,COMMA we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA companies didn't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course ,COMMA or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course ,COMMA just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .PERIOD 
it was the result of decades of sustained activism ,COMMA shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy .PERIOD 
similarly ,COMMA governments don't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day .PERIOD 
it's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations ,COMMA and that you get the right corporate behavior .PERIOD 
we need to make the same approach with the internet .PERIOD 
we also are going to need political innovation .PERIOD 
eight hundred years ago ,COMMA approximately ,COMMA the barons of england decided that the divine right of kings was no longer working for them so well ,COMMA and they forced king john to sign the magna carta ,COMMA which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules .PERIOD 
this set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation ,COMMA which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in america across the pond .PERIOD 
so now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked .PERIOD 
and what does that look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
at the moment ,COMMA we still don't know .PERIOD 
but it's going to require innovation that's not only going to need to focus on politics ,COMMA on geopolitics ,COMMA but it's also going to need to deal with questions of business management ,COMMA investor behavior ,COMMA consumer choice and even software design and engineering .PERIOD 
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world's people and not the other way around .PERIOD 
these are grim economic times ,COMMA fellow tedsters ,COMMA grim economic times indeed .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA i would like to cheer you up with one of the great ,COMMA albeit largely unknown ,COMMA commercial success stories of the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity .PERIOD 
i refer to organized crime .PERIOD 
now organized crime has been around for a very long time ,COMMA i hear you say ,COMMA and these would be wise words ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD 
but in the last two decades ,COMMA it has experienced an unprecedented expansion ,COMMA now accounting for roughly <NUM> percent of the world's gdp .PERIOD 
i like to call it the global shadow economy ,COMMA or mcmafia ,COMMA for short .PERIOD 
so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there is globalization ,COMMA technology ,COMMA communications ,COMMA all that stuff ,COMMA which we'll talk about a little bit later .PERIOD 
but first ,COMMA i would like to take you back to this event :COLON the collapse of communism .PERIOD 
all across eastern europe ,COMMA a most momentous episode in our post-war history .PERIOD 
now it's time for full disclosure .PERIOD 
this event meant a great deal to me personally .PERIOD 
i had started smuggling books across the iron curtain to democratic opposition groups in eastern europe ,COMMA like solidarity in poland ,COMMA when i was in my teens .PERIOD 
i then started writing about eastern europe ,COMMA and eventually i became the bbc's chief correspondent for the region ,COMMA which is what i was doing in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and so when <NUM> million people finally won the right to choose their own governments ,COMMA i was ecstatic ,COMMA but i was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall .PERIOD 
it wasn't long ,COMMA for example ,COMMA before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in yugoslavia .PERIOD 
and amongst the chaos ,COMMA amidst the euphoria ,COMMA it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before <NUM> ,COMMA in eastern europe ,COMMA continued to do so after the revolutions there .PERIOD 
obviously there were characters like this .PERIOD 
but there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in eastern europe .PERIOD 
like this character .PERIOD remember these guys ?QUESTIONMARK 
they used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling ,COMMA every four years in the olympics ,COMMA and they were the great celebrities of communism ,COMMA with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it .PERIOD 
they used to get great apartments in the center of town ,COMMA casual sex on tap ,COMMA and they could travel to the west very freely ,COMMA which was a great luxury at the time .PERIOD 
it may come as a surprise ,COMMA but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in eastern europe .PERIOD 
or as i like to call them ,COMMA they are the midwives of capitalism .PERIOD 
now in bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over eastern europe ,COMMA it wasn't just communism ;SEMICOLON it was the state that collapsed as well .PERIOD 
that means your police force wasn't working .PERIOD 
the court system wasn't functioning properly .PERIOD 
so what was a business man in the brave new world of east european capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA he would turn to people who were called ,COMMA rather prosaically by sociologists ,COMMA privatized law enforcement agencies .PERIOD 
we prefer to know them as the mafia .PERIOD 
and in bulgaria ,COMMA the mafia was soon joined with <NUM> people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when your state is collapsing ,COMMA your economy is heading south at a rate of knots ,COMMA the last people you want coming on to the labor market are <NUM> men and women whose chief skills are surveillance ,COMMA are smuggling ,COMMA building underground networks and killing people .PERIOD 
but that's what happened all over eastern europe .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when i was working in the 1990s ,COMMA i spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in yugoslavia .PERIOD 
and i couldn't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities ,COMMA the paramilitary organizations ,COMMA were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates .PERIOD 
and i came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise .PERIOD 
but above all else ,COMMA by talking to the gangsters themselves .PERIOD 
and the balkans was a fabulous place to start .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing ,COMMA but also ,COMMA as they say in the retail trade ,COMMA it's location ,COMMA location ,COMMA location .PERIOD 
and what i noticed at the beginning of my research that the balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world .PERIOD 
heroin ,COMMA cocaine ,COMMA women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals .PERIOD 
and where were they heading ?QUESTIONMARK 
the european union ,COMMA which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization ,COMMA transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history ,COMMA eventually comprising some <NUM> million people .PERIOD 
and a significant minority of those <NUM> million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes ,COMMA sticking <NUM> euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers .PERIOD 
it has zones of production ,COMMA like afghanistan and columbia .PERIOD 
it has zones of distribution ,COMMA like mexico and the balkans .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it has zones of consumption ,COMMA like the european union ,COMMA japan and of course ,COMMA the united states .PERIOD 
the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world ,COMMA and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed .PERIOD 
take mexico ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
six thousand people killed there in the last <NUM> months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade .PERIOD 
but what about the democratic republic of congo ?QUESTIONMARK 
since <NUM> ,COMMA five million people have died there .PERIOD 
it's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers ,COMMA but it's the biggest conflict on this planet since the second world war .PERIOD 
and why is it ?QUESTIONMARK because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region .PERIOD 
in the year <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern democratic republic of congo .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone ,COMMA in almost every laptop and games console .PERIOD 
the congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons ,COMMA and the mafia would then sell it on to western markets .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA let me show you some of my friends in action ,COMMA caught conveniently on film by the italian police ,COMMA and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap .PERIOD 
the european union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world .PERIOD 
so if you can smuggle them into the eu ,COMMA there are very handsome profits to be made ,COMMA and i want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups .PERIOD 
this boat is worth one million euros when it's new .PERIOD 
and it's the fastest thing on european waters .PERIOD 
from <NUM> ,COMMA for seven years ,COMMA <NUM> of these boats made the trip across the adriatic ,COMMA from montenegro to italy ,COMMA every single night .PERIOD 
and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals .PERIOD 
now italian police ,COMMA when this trade started ,COMMA had just two boats which could go at the same speed .PERIOD 
and this is very important ,COMMA because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas .PERIOD 
sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution ,COMMA and if the police intervened ,COMMA they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning ,COMMA rather than chasing the bad guys .PERIOD 
so i have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats ,COMMA how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys .PERIOD 
and the answer is six vessels .PERIOD 
and remember ,COMMA <NUM> of these speed boats were coming across the adriatic every single night .PERIOD 
it was the liberalization of international financial markets .PERIOD 
and boy ,COMMA did that make it easy for the money launderers .PERIOD 
the last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre .PERIOD 
in the 1990s ,COMMA we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business ,COMMA and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering .PERIOD 
and a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked .PERIOD 
but at the heart of this ,COMMA is the offshore banking network .PERIOD 
now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade ,COMMA and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime ,COMMA money laundering ,COMMA you have to get rid of them .PERIOD 
on a positive note ,COMMA we at last have someone in the white house who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities .PERIOD 
and if anyone is concerned about what i believe is the necessity for new legislation ,COMMA regulation ,COMMA effective regulation ,COMMA i say ,COMMA let's take a look at bernie madoff ,COMMA who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail .PERIOD 
bernie madoff stole <NUM> billion dollars .PERIOD 
that puts him up there on the olympus of gangsters with the colombian cartels and the major russian crime syndicates ,COMMA but he did this for decades in the very heart of wall street ,COMMA and no regulator picked up on it .PERIOD 
so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london ,COMMA fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ?QUESTIONMARK 
well i can tell you ,COMMA it's quite a few of them .PERIOD 
let me go on to the <NUM> of international organized crime now .PERIOD 
and that is narcotics .PERIOD our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning .PERIOD 
it's one of the tens of thousands of mom-and-pop grow-ops in bc .PERIOD 
which ensure that over five percent of the province's gdp is accounted for by this trade .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i was taken by inspector brian cantera ,COMMA of the royal canadian mounted police ,COMMA to a cavernous warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the rcmp from the smugglers who are sending it ,COMMA of course ,COMMA down south to the united states where there is an insatiable market for bc .PERIOD bud ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA in part because it's marketed as organic ,COMMA which of course goes down very well in california .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA even by the police's admission ,COMMA this makes not a dent in the profits ,COMMA really ,COMMA of the major exporters .PERIOD 
since the beginning of globalization ,COMMA the global narcotics market has expanded enormously .PERIOD 
there has ,COMMA however ,COMMA been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA however ,COMMA may all be about to change ,COMMA because something very strange is going on .PERIOD 
the united nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs .PERIOD 
interestingly ,COMMA the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down ,COMMA because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs .PERIOD 
now that is a game changer ,COMMA because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the western world .PERIOD 
when that happens ,COMMA it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west .PERIOD 
the drugs policy which we've had in place for <NUM> years is long overdue for a very serious rethink ,COMMA in my opinion .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the recession .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession .PERIOD 
not surprising ,COMMA the most opportunistic industry in the whole world .PERIOD 
and it has no rules to its regulatory system .PERIOD 
except ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it has two business risks :COLON arrest by law enforcement ,COMMA which is ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA the least of their worries ,COMMA and competition from other groups ,COMMA ie .PERIOD a bullet in the back of the head .PERIOD 
and so instead ,COMMA they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way ,COMMA but above all ,COMMA two sectors ,COMMA and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime .PERIOD 
and it's been terribly successful .PERIOD 
i would like to introduce you to mr .PERIOD pringle .PERIOD 
or perhaps i should say ,COMMA more accurately ,COMMA señor pringle .PERIOD 
i was introduced to this bit of kit by a brazilian cybercriminal .PERIOD 
we sat in a car on the avenue paulista in são paulo ,COMMA together .PERIOD 
hooked it up to my laptop ,COMMA and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major brazilian bank .PERIOD 
it's really not that difficult .PERIOD 
and it's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it's not so much the technology .PERIOD 
the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .PERIOD 
or to use the technical term for it ,COMMA there's one born every minute .PERIOD 
you would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest .PERIOD 
and it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love .PERIOD 
i expect some of you remember the iloveyou virus ,COMMA one of the very great worldwide viruses that came .PERIOD 
i was very fortunate when the iloveyou virus came out ,COMMA because the first person i received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time ,COMMA but love was not amongst them .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA cybercrime ,COMMA do watch out for it .PERIOD 
one thing that we do know that the internet is doing is the internet is assisting these guys .PERIOD 
these are mosquitoes who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection .PERIOD 
but over the past year or so ,COMMA researchers in cambodia have discovered that what's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance .PERIOD 
and they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance is because cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market ,COMMA and so they buy it from the internet .PERIOD 
and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient .PERIOD 
which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance .PERIOD 
the reason i say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives .PERIOD 
you don't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime .PERIOD 
they affect our bank accounts .PERIOD 
they affect our communications ,COMMA our pension funds .PERIOD 
they even affect the food that we eat and our governments .PERIOD 
this is no longer an issue of sicilians from palermo and new york .PERIOD 
there is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st century .PERIOD 
this is a mighty industry ,COMMA and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes .PERIOD 
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very ,COMMA very seriously .PERIOD 
it's been a privilege talking to you .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA when chris first approached me to speak at ted ,COMMA i said no ,COMMA because i felt like i wasn't going to be able to make that personal connection ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that i wanted to .PERIOD 
but he explained to me that he was in a bind ,COMMA and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so i said fine ,COMMA ted -- i mean chris .PERIOD i'll come on two conditions .PERIOD 
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .PERIOD 
and two -- i want to pick the theme for ted <NUM> .PERIOD 
and luckily he agreed .PERIOD and the theme ,COMMA in two years ,COMMA is going to be cute pictures of puppies .PERIOD 
i invented the placebo camera .PERIOD 
it doesn't actually take pictures ,COMMA but it's a hell of a lot cheaper ,COMMA and you still feel like you were there .PERIOD 
dear sir ,COMMA good day ,COMMA compliments of the day ,COMMA and my best wishes to you and family .PERIOD i know this letter will come to you surprisingly ,COMMA but let it not be a surprise to you ,COMMA for nature has a way of arriving unannounced ,COMMA and ,COMMA as an adage says ,COMMA originals are very hard to find ,COMMA but their echoes sound louder .PERIOD so i decided to contact you myself ,COMMA for you to assure me of safety and honesty ,COMMA if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .PERIOD 
i am mister michael bangoora ,COMMA the son of late mister tiamu bangoora -- who was the minister of finance in sierra leone -- but was killed during a civil war .PERIOD 
knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment ,COMMA and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business ,COMMA on which premise i write you .PERIOD 
before my father death ,COMMA he had the sum of <NUM> million united states dollars ,COMMA which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war .PERIOD 
this fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country ,COMMA before the outbreak of war .PERIOD when the war broke out ,COMMA the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him ,COMMA my father insisted it was not in his possession ,COMMA and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund .PERIOD 
meanwhile ,COMMA my mother and i is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me .PERIOD 
i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker ,COMMA who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport ,COMMA freetown ,COMMA although he did not know the real contents of the box .PERIOD 
the fund was deposited as a family reassure ,COMMA in a safe ,COMMA reliable security company in dakar ,COMMA senegal ,COMMA where i was only given temporary asylum .PERIOD 
i do not wish to invest the money in senegal due to unfavorable economic climate ,COMMA and so close to my country .PERIOD 
the only assistance i need from you ,COMMA which i know you would do for me ,COMMA are the following :COLON one ,COMMA be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ;SEMICOLON two ,COMMA provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ;SEMICOLON three ,COMMA receive the funds into your account in trust ;SEMICOLON take out your commission ;SEMICOLON and leave the rest of the money until i arrive ,COMMA after the transfer is complete .PERIOD 
sincerely ,COMMA mister michael bangoora .PERIOD 
this is really embarrassing .PERIOD 
i was told backstage that i have <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
i only prepared <NUM> .PERIOD 
so if it's cool ,COMMA i'd like to just wait for three .PERIOD 
i'm really sorry .PERIOD 
what's your name ?QUESTIONMARK 
are you a virgin ?QUESTIONMARK virgin ?QUESTIONMARK 
are you ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD so what are you ,COMMA like ,COMMA a thousand ,COMMA two thousand ,COMMA somewhere in there ?QUESTIONMARK huh ?QUESTIONMARK oh ?QUESTIONMARK 
you don't know what i'm talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
ah ,COMMA mark -- serfaas .PERIOD 
and that's nothing to be ashamed of .PERIOD 
that's nothing to be ashamed of .PERIOD 
yeah ,COMMA i was hanging out with some google guys last night .PERIOD 
really cool ,COMMA we were getting wasted .PERIOD 
and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that ,COMMA based on your interaction with google over your lifetime ,COMMA they can actually predict what you are going to say next .PERIOD 
and i was like ,COMMA get the fuck out of here .PERIOD that's crazy .PERIOD 
but they said ,COMMA no ,COMMA but don't show anyone ,COMMA but they slipped up .PERIOD 
and they said that i could just type in what was i going to say next ?QUESTIONMARK 
what was i going to say next ?QUESTIONMARK and ze frank -- that's me .PERIOD 
am i feeling lucky ?QUESTIONMARK 
audience :COLON yes .PERIOD 
in march of <NUM> -- i filmed myself dancing to madonna's justify my love .PERIOD 
on a thursday ,COMMA i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to <NUM> of my closest friends ,COMMA as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th -- th -- 26th birthday party .PERIOD 
by monday ,COMMA over a million people were coming to this site a day .PERIOD 
within a week ,COMMA i received a call from earthlink that said ,COMMA due to a <NUM> cents per megabyte overage charge ,COMMA i owed them <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA finally ,COMMA you know ,COMMA become freelance .PERIOD 
but some people refer to me more of -- as ,COMMA like ,COMMA an internet guru or -- swami .PERIOD 
i -- i knew i had something .PERIOD 
i'd basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy ,COMMA which i won't get into here ,COMMA because it's a little too deep for all of you ,COMMA but -- it's about what makes websites popular ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's -- it's unfortunate that i don't have more time .PERIOD 
maybe i can come back next year ,COMMA or something like that .PERIOD 
i'm obsessed with email .PERIOD i get a lot of it .PERIOD 
it's like a microscope to the rest of the world .PERIOD 
you can kind of peer into other people's lives ,COMMA and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA somebody wrote me .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA hey ze ,COMMA if you ever come to boulder ,COMMA you should rock out with us ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA why wait ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA hey ze ,COMMA thanks for rocking out ,COMMA but i meant the kind of rocking out where we'd be naked .PERIOD 
but you know ,COMMA it's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans ,COMMA so i said ,COMMA sure .PERIOD 
i hear a lot of you whispering .PERIOD 
and i know what you're saying .PERIOD you're saying ,COMMA holy crap ,COMMA how is his presentation so smooth ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i have to say that it's not all me this year .PERIOD 
i guess chris has to take some credit here ,COMMA because in years past ,COMMA i guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at ted .PERIOD i don't know .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA this year ,COMMA chris sent us a ted conference simulator .PERIOD 
which really allowed us as speakers to get there ,COMMA in the trenches ,COMMA and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience .PERIOD 
and i gotta say that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's really ,COMMA really great to be here .PERIOD 
i'd like to tell all of you a little joke .PERIOD not just the good stuff ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
you can do heckler mode .PERIOD 
voice :COLON hey ,COMMA moron ,COMMA get off the stage .PERIOD 
you get off the stage .PERIOD 
voice :COLON we want malcolm gladwell .PERIOD 
in case you run over time .PERIOD 
i'd -- just one last thing i'd like to say ,COMMA i'd ,COMMA really -- like to thank all of you for being here .PERIOD 
and frog mode .PERIOD 
ah ,COMMA the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp . .PERIOD 
it's true .PERIOD some people say to me ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ze ,COMMA you're doing all this stuff ,COMMA this internet stuff ,COMMA and you're not making any money .PERIOD 
why ?QUESTIONMARK and i say ,COMMA mom ,COMMA dad -- i'm trying .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i don't know if you're all aware of this ,COMMA but the video -- the video game market ,COMMA kids are playing these video games ,COMMA oh ,COMMA but ,COMMA supposedly ,COMMA there's tons of money .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA like ,COMMA i think ,COMMA <NUM> dollars or so a year is being spent on these things .PERIOD so i decided to try my hand .PERIOD 
i came up with a few games .PERIOD 
this is called atheist .PERIOD 
i figured it'd be popular with the young kids .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA i'll move around and say some things .PERIOD 
so that didn't go over so well .PERIOD 
i don't really understand why you're laughing .PERIOD 
should have done this before i tried to pitch it .PERIOD 
buddhist ,COMMA of course ,COMMA looks very ,COMMA very similar to atheist .PERIOD 
but you come back as a duck .PERIOD 
and this is great because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a quarter ,COMMA you can play this for a long time .PERIOD 
and chris had said in an email that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we should really bring something new to ted ,COMMA something that we haven't shown anyone .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i made this for ted .PERIOD it's christian .PERIOD 
it's the third in the series .PERIOD 
i'm hoping it's going to do well this year .PERIOD 
do you have a preference ?QUESTIONMARK good choice .PERIOD 
so you can wait for the second coming -- which is -- a random number between one and <NUM> million .PERIOD 
so really ,COMMA what are we talking about here ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA tech joy .PERIOD 
tech joy ,COMMA to me ,COMMA means something ,COMMA because i get a lot of joy out of tech .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA making things using technology -- and i'm being serious here ,COMMA even though i'm using my sarcastic voice -- i won't -- hold on .PERIOD making things ,COMMA you know -- making things actually does give me a lot of joy .PERIOD 
it's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life ,COMMA and it's that feeling of being about <NUM> percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do ,COMMA but it's not finished ,COMMA and you're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA what i've done is ,COMMA i started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don't consider themselves artists .PERIOD 
we're in a culture of guru-ship .PERIOD it's so hard to use some software because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's unapproachable ,COMMA people feel like they have to read the manual .PERIOD 
so i try to -- -- i try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves ,COMMA and ,COMMA hopefully -- whoa ,COMMA i'm like -- on the page ,COMMA but it doesn't exist .PERIOD 
it's ,COMMA like -- seriously ,COMMA though -- i try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves .PERIOD 
here i created a contest called ,COMMA when office supplies attack ,COMMA which ,COMMA i think ,COMMA really resonated with the -- working population .PERIOD 
over <NUM> entries in three weeks ,COMMA toilet paper fashion .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible .PERIOD 
online drawing tools -- you've probably seen a lot of them .PERIOD 
i think they're wonderful .PERIOD 
i think it's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff .PERIOD but i'm interested in the process ,COMMA the process of creating ,COMMA as the real event that i'm interested in .PERIOD 
and the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing ,COMMA and they get bummed out at this ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA stick figure ,COMMA awful little thing that they created .PERIOD 
and eventually ,COMMA it just makes them stop playing with it ,COMMA or draw ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they draw penises and things like that .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA it's a helping tool .PERIOD 
you can draw your simple stick figure ,COMMA and then it collaborates with you to create ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA like ,COMMA a post-war german etching .PERIOD 
so you can -- in fact ,COMMA it's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse .PERIOD so ,COMMA we go ahead ,COMMA and we start scribbling ,COMMA and -- so the idea is that you can really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA partake in this process ,COMMA but watch something really crappy look beautiful .PERIOD 
and here are some of my favorites .PERIOD this is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me .PERIOD here we are ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD 
darling .PERIOD beautiful stuff .PERIOD 
i'm -- i'm dead serious here .PERIOD i'm actually -- this is not a joke .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA i think ,COMMA it's a -- it's a really fun and wonderful thing .PERIOD 
so this is called the fiction project .PERIOD this is an online space ,COMMA which is -- it's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing .PERIOD 
these are haikus .PERIOD 
i think that the now tied up ,COMMA tied down ,COMMA mistress cruel approaches me ,COMMA now tied down ,COMMA it's up .PERIOD 
it's -- it's an amazing way ,COMMA and i'll tell you ,COMMA if you come home ,COMMA and your spouse ,COMMA or whoever it is ,COMMA says ,COMMA let's talk -- that ,COMMA like ,COMMA chills you to the very core .PERIOD 
but it's peripheral activities ,COMMA like these ,COMMA that allow people to get together ,COMMA doing fun things .PERIOD 
they actually get to know each other ,COMMA and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking .PERIOD and very ,COMMA very quickly -- i love puppets .PERIOD here's a puppet .PERIOD 
i became interested in puppets ,COMMA and i just want to show one last thing to you .PERIOD 
oh ,COMMA this is how you make puppets .PERIOD 
and it's the bicentenary of charles darwin .PERIOD 
and all over the world ,COMMA eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this .PERIOD 
and what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of darwin and his life ,COMMA and how he changed our thinking .PERIOD 
i say almost every aspect ,COMMA because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on .PERIOD 
and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else .PERIOD 
it's the question of ,COMMA why are we so different from the chimpanzees ?QUESTIONMARK 
and yet ,COMMA when you look at the phenotypes ,COMMA there's a chimp ,COMMA there's a man ;SEMICOLON they're astoundingly different ,COMMA no resemblance at all .PERIOD 
i'm talking about ground-base ,COMMA nitty-gritty ,COMMA measurable physical differences .PERIOD 
they ,COMMA that one ,COMMA is hairy and walking on four legs .PERIOD 
that one is a naked biped .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean -- if i'm a good darwinist ,COMMA i've got to believe there's a reason for that .PERIOD 
if we changed so much ,COMMA something must have happened .PERIOD 
what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
now <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that was a laughably simple question .PERIOD 
everybody knew the answer .PERIOD 
they knew what happened .PERIOD 
the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees ;SEMICOLON our ancestors went out onto the plain .PERIOD 
that explained everything .PERIOD 
we had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass ,COMMA or to chase after animals ,COMMA or to free our hands for weapons .PERIOD 
and we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away .PERIOD 
everybody knew that ,COMMA for generations .PERIOD 
but then ,COMMA in the '90s ,COMMA something began to unravel .PERIOD 
the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids .PERIOD 
and they weren't savanna species .PERIOD 
and they looked at the herbivores .PERIOD and they weren't savanna herbivores .PERIOD 
and then they were so clever ,COMMA they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen .PERIOD 
shock ,COMMA horror .PERIOD 
the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation .PERIOD 
some of it even came from lianas ,COMMA those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle .PERIOD 
so we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees ,COMMA before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence .PERIOD 
this is not something i've made up .PERIOD 
it's not a minority theory .PERIOD 
everybody agrees with it .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA everything i've been telling you for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA forget about it .PERIOD it was wrong .PERIOD 
we've got to go back to square one and start again .PERIOD 
it made him very unpopular .PERIOD they didn't want to go back to square one .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it's a terrible thing to happen .PERIOD 
you've got this beautiful paradigm .PERIOD 
nobody has questioned it .PERIOD 
you've been constructing fanciful things on top of it ,COMMA relying on it to be as solid as a rock .PERIOD 
and now it's whipped away from under you .PERIOD 
what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK what does a scientist do in that case ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA we know the answer because thomas s .PERIOD kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is ,COMMA guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened .PERIOD 
if they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question .PERIOD 
so they say ,COMMA yes it's wrong ,COMMA but supposing it was right . .PERIOD 
and the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions .PERIOD 
that's why you don't hear them talking about it .PERIOD it's yesterday's question .PERIOD 
some of them have even elevated it into a principle .PERIOD 
it's what we ought to be doing .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA why don't we talk about ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's chromosomes ,COMMA and there's genes .PERIOD 
and we just record what we see .PERIOD 
charles darwin must be spinning in his grave !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
he knew all about that kind of science .PERIOD 
and he called it hypothesis-free science .PERIOD 
and he despised it from the bottom of his heart .PERIOD 
and if you're going to say ,COMMA i'm going to stop talking about selective pressures ,COMMA you can take the origin of species and throw it out of the window ,COMMA for it's about nothing else but selective pressures .PERIOD 
and the irony of it is ,COMMA that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up .PERIOD 
there was one waiting in the wings .PERIOD 
it had been waiting there since <NUM> when alister hardy ,COMMA a marine biologist ,COMMA said ,COMMA i think what happened ,COMMA perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time .PERIOD 
but then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose .PERIOD 
all his colleagues said ,COMMA this is outrageous .PERIOD 
you've exposed us to public ridicule !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
you must never do that again .PERIOD 
well i don't think that .PERIOD 
i think that hardy had a lot going for him .PERIOD 
i'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind ,COMMA the things that made us different from everybody else ,COMMA and all our relatives .PERIOD 
let's look at our naked skin .PERIOD 
it's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair ,COMMA mammals without body hair ,COMMA are aquatic ones ,COMMA like the dugong ,COMMA the walrus ,COMMA the dolphin ,COMMA the hippopotamus ,COMMA the manatee .PERIOD 
and a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa .PERIOD 
and you're tempted to think ,COMMA well perhaps ,COMMA could that be why we are naked ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA look at the elephant .PERIOD 
you've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you ?QUESTIONMARK 
so back in <NUM> i said ,COMMA well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor .PERIOD 
but by now ,COMMA everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor .PERIOD 
the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros .PERIOD 
last year in florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said ,COMMA seems to have spent most of its time in the water .PERIOD 
as an absolute connection ,COMMA it only works one way .PERIOD 
you can't say all aquatic animals are naked ,COMMA because look at the sea otter .PERIOD 
but you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water ,COMMA in its own lifetime ,COMMA or the lifetime of its ancestors .PERIOD i think this is significant .PERIOD 
the only exception is the naked somalian mole-rat ,COMMA which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .PERIOD 
and take bipedality .PERIOD 
but you can say this :COLON all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs ,COMMA if they want to ,COMMA for a short time .PERIOD 
do you think that's significant ?QUESTIONMARK 
look at the fat layer .PERIOD 
we have got ,COMMA under our skin ,COMMA a layer of fat ,COMMA all over :COLON nothing in the least like that in any other primate .PERIOD 
why should it be there ?QUESTIONMARK 
well they do know ,COMMA that if you look at other aquatic mammals ,COMMA the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall ,COMMA around the kidneys and the intestines and so on ,COMMA has started to migrate to the outside ,COMMA and spread out in a layer inside the skin .PERIOD 
we cannot avoid the suspicion that in our case it's started to happen .PERIOD 
we have got skin lined with this layer .PERIOD 
it's the only possible explanation of why humans ,COMMA if they're very unlucky ,COMMA can become grossly obese ,COMMA in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate ,COMMA physically impossible .PERIOD 
something very odd ,COMMA matter-of-factly ,COMMA never explained .PERIOD 
the question of why we can speak .PERIOD 
and the gorilla can't speak .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath .PERIOD 
you can't even train a gorilla to say ah on request .PERIOD 
the only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds .PERIOD 
it was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak .PERIOD 
and then again ,COMMA there is the fact that we are streamlined .PERIOD 
trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash .PERIOD 
i am trying to suggest that ,COMMA for 40-odd years ,COMMA this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe ,COMMA and it is not lunatic fringe .PERIOD 
and the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own ,COMMA which they've all agreed on ,COMMA and they love .PERIOD 
they are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum .PERIOD 
how do they react when i say these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
one very common reaction i've heard about <NUM> times is ,COMMA but it was investigated .PERIOD 
they conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning ,COMMA when hardy put forward his article .PERIOD 
for <NUM> years i've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind ,COMMA and i've concluded that that's one of the urban myths .PERIOD 
it's never been done .PERIOD 
i ask people sometimes ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA i like the aquatic theory !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
everybody likes the aquatic theory .PERIOD 
of course they don't believe it ,COMMA but they like it .PERIOD 
well i say ,COMMA why do you think it's rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK 
they say well . .PERIOD 
everybody i talk to says it's rubbish .PERIOD 
and they can't all be wrong ,COMMA can they ?QUESTIONMARK 
the answer to that ,COMMA loud and clear ,COMMA is ,COMMA yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK they can all be wrong .PERIOD 
history is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong .PERIOD 
and if you've got a scientific problem like that ,COMMA you can't solve it by holding a head count ,COMMA and saying ,COMMA more of us say yes than say no .PERIOD 
apart from that ,COMMA some of the heads count more than others .PERIOD 
some of them have come over .PERIOD 
sir david attenborough ,COMMA he's come over .PERIOD 
anybody else out there ?QUESTIONMARK come on in .PERIOD 
the water is lovely .PERIOD 
and now we've got to look to the future .PERIOD 
ultimately one of three things is going to happen .PERIOD 
either they will go on for the next <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> years .PERIOD 
yeah well we don't talk about that .PERIOD let's talk about something interesting .PERIOD 
that would be very sad .PERIOD 
the second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive ,COMMA and say ,COMMA i've found it .PERIOD 
it was not the savanna ,COMMA it was not the water ,COMMA it was this !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
no sign of that happening either .PERIOD 
i don't think there is a third option .PERIOD 
if you look back at the early years of the last century ,COMMA there was a stand-off ,COMMA a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel ,COMMA and the believers in darwin .PERIOD 
it ended with a new synthesis :COLON darwin's ideas and mendel's ideas blending together .PERIOD 
and i think the same thing will happen here .PERIOD 
you'll get a new synthesis .PERIOD 
hardy's ideas and darwin's ideas will be blended together .PERIOD 
and we can move forward from there ,COMMA and really get somewhere .PERIOD 
that would be a beautiful thing .PERIOD 
it would be very nice for me if it happened soon .PERIOD 
because i'm older now than george burns was when he said ,COMMA at my age ,COMMA i don't even buy green bananas .PERIOD 
so if it's going to come and it's going to happen ,COMMA what's holding it up ?QUESTIONMARK 
academia says no .PERIOD 
they decided in <NUM> ,COMMA that belongs with the ufos and the yetis .PERIOD 
and it's not easy to change their minds .PERIOD 
the professional journals won't touch it with a barge pole .PERIOD 
the syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked ,COMMA let alone look for a reason to it .PERIOD 
horizon ,COMMA which takes its cue from the academics ,COMMA won't touch it with a barge pole .PERIOD 
so we never hear the case put for it ,COMMA except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe .PERIOD 
i don't know quite where this diktat comes from .PERIOD 
somebody up there is issuing the commandment ,COMMA thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory .PERIOD 
and if you hope to make progress in this profession ,COMMA and you do believe it ,COMMA you'd better keep it to yourself ,COMMA because it will get in your way .PERIOD 
so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood .PERIOD 
but you know ,COMMA that makes me feel good ,COMMA because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood .PERIOD 
he says ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA you've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it's been trained to receive .PERIOD 
right .PERIOD i'll go ahead with that .PERIOD 
and secondly ,COMMA he says ,COMMA you must never be afraid to rock the boat .PERIOD 
i'll go along with that too .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
my name is kate hartman .PERIOD 
and i like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate .PERIOD 
so i'm specifically interested in how we ,COMMA as humans ,COMMA relate to ourselves ,COMMA each other and the world around us .PERIOD 
so just to give you a bit of context ,COMMA as june said ,COMMA i'm an artist ,COMMA a technologist and an educator .PERIOD 
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .PERIOD 
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .PERIOD 
and so anytime i talk about what i do ,COMMA i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter .PERIOD 
i can guarantee ,COMMA everyone in this room ,COMMA all of you over there ,COMMA the people in the cushy seats ,COMMA the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies .PERIOD 
don't be ashamed .PERIOD 
it's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world .PERIOD 
so within my own work ,COMMA i use a broad range of materials and tools .PERIOD 
so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing .PERIOD 
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make ,COMMA the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .PERIOD 
and so it all started several years ago ,COMMA late one night when i was sitting on the subway ,COMMA riding home ,COMMA and i was thinking .PERIOD 
and i tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little .PERIOD 
and so i was thinking about how it might be great if i could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else .PERIOD 
and so i went home ,COMMA and i made a prototype of this hat .PERIOD 
and i called it the muttering hat ,COMMA because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you ,COMMA but you could detach them and share them with somebody else .PERIOD 
so i make other hats as well .PERIOD 
this one is called the talk to yourself hat .PERIOD 
it's fairly self-explanatory .PERIOD 
it physically carves out conversation space for one .PERIOD 
and when you speak out loud ,COMMA the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears .PERIOD 
and so when i make these things ,COMMA it's really not so much about the object itself ,COMMA but rather the negative space around the object .PERIOD 
so what happens when a person puts this thing on ?QUESTIONMARK 
what kind of an experience do they have ?QUESTIONMARK 
and how are they transformed by wearing it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves .PERIOD 
so this particular device is called the gut listener .PERIOD 
and so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication .PERIOD 
and so the inflatable heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves .PERIOD 
so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions .PERIOD 
so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst .PERIOD 
and some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences .PERIOD 
so the discommunicator is a tool for arguments .PERIOD 
and so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange ,COMMA but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered .PERIOD 
and in the end ,COMMA some of these things just act as invitations .PERIOD 
so the ear bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say .PERIOD 
so even though i'm really interested in the relationship between people ,COMMA i also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us .PERIOD 
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back ,COMMA i was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
maybe if i want to better relate to walls ,COMMA maybe i need to be more wall-like myself .PERIOD 
so i made a wearable wall that i could wear as a backpack .PERIOD 
and so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .PERIOD 
and so jumping off of that ,COMMA thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world ,COMMA i have this ongoing project called botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols .PERIOD 
so when a plant is thirsty ,COMMA it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like twitter .PERIOD 
and so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic ,COMMA because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time .PERIOD 
and so kind of thinking about scale ,COMMA my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course .PERIOD 
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings ,COMMA and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them ,COMMA but what i'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .PERIOD 
because there seems to be an issue .PERIOD 
the glaciers are actually leaving us .PERIOD 
they're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether .PERIOD 
and so i actually live in canada now ,COMMA so i've been visiting one of my local glaciers .PERIOD 
and this one's particularly interesting ,COMMA because ,COMMA of all the glaciers in north america ,COMMA it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year .PERIOD 
they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier .PERIOD 
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .PERIOD 
there's no kind of social protocol for this .PERIOD 
i really just don't even know how to say hello .PERIOD 
or perhaps i can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube morse code .PERIOD 
or perhaps i need to make myself a speaking tool ,COMMA like an icy megaphone that i can use to amplify my voice when i direct it at the ice .PERIOD 
and i was really struck by how much it affected me .PERIOD 
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .PERIOD 
and so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days ,COMMA i actually made a device called the glacier embracing suit .PERIOD 
and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice .PERIOD 
and once again ,COMMA it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA yea ,COMMA this is actually just the beginning .PERIOD 
these are initial musings for this project .PERIOD 
and so my intent is to actually just take the next <NUM> years and go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines -- artists ,COMMA technologists ,COMMA scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations .PERIOD 
so beyond that ,COMMA in closing ,COMMA i'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation ,COMMA and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy ,COMMA but i think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
one of the things that defines a tedster is you've taken your passion ,COMMA and you've turned it into stewardship .PERIOD 
you actually put action to the issues you care about .PERIOD 
but what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out .PERIOD 
one of the things i should probably tell you is ,COMMA i worked for the discovery channel early in my career ,COMMA and that sort of warped my framework .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA when you start to think about politicians ,COMMA you've got to realize these are strange creatures .PERIOD 
other than the fact that they can't tell directions ,COMMA and they have very strange breeding habits ,COMMA how do you actually work with these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
what we need to understand is :COLON what drives the political creature ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart :COLON one is reputation and influence .PERIOD 
these are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job .PERIOD 
the second one -- unlike most animals ,COMMA which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self .PERIOD 
now you may think it's money ,COMMA but that's actually sort of a proxy to what i can do to preserve myself .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what doesn't work ,COMMA in terms of getting your issue to be important ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can send them an email .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA i've got so many viagra ads coming at me ,COMMA your email is lost .PERIOD 
it doesn't matter ,COMMA it's spam .PERIOD 
how about you get on the phone ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA chances are i've got a droid who's picking up the phone ,COMMA yes ,COMMA they called ,COMMA and they said they didn't like it .PERIOD 
face to face would work ,COMMA but it's hard to set it up .PERIOD 
it's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation ,COMMA but it takes some time to build up .PERIOD 
so what actually works ?QUESTIONMARK 
and the answer is rather strange .PERIOD 
it's a letter .PERIOD 
we live in a digital world ,COMMA but we're fairly analog creatures .PERIOD 
letters actually work .PERIOD 
even the top dog himself takes time every day to read <NUM> letters that are picked out by staff .PERIOD 
i can tell you that every official that i've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA how are you going to write your letter ?QUESTIONMARK 
first of all ,COMMA you're going to pick up an analog device :COLON a pen .PERIOD 
i know these are tough ,COMMA and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it ,COMMA but this is actually critical .PERIOD 
and it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter .PERIOD 
it is so novel to see this ,COMMA that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me .PERIOD 
second of all ,COMMA i'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with .PERIOD 
so in paragraph number one ,COMMA what i'm going to tell you to do is very simply this :COLON you appreciate them .PERIOD 
you may not appreciate the person ,COMMA you may not appreciate anything else ,COMMA but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig .PERIOD 
when animals are going to make a point ,COMMA they make the point .PERIOD 
they don't spend a lot of time dicking around .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here you go .PERIOD 
paragraph number two :COLON you may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind .PERIOD 
when you do this ,COMMA don't attack people ;SEMICOLON you attack tactics .PERIOD 
ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere .PERIOD 
paragraph number three :COLON when animals are attacked or cornered ,COMMA they will fight to the death ,COMMA so you have to give them an exit .PERIOD 
most of the time ,COMMA if they have an exit strategy ,COMMA they should take it .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA you're intelligent .PERIOD 
lastly ,COMMA you want to be the nurturing agent .PERIOD 
you're the safe place to come in to .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in paragraph number four ,COMMA you're going to tell people ,COMMA if no one is providing you with this information ,COMMA let me help .PERIOD 
animals do displays .PERIOD they do two things :COLON they warn you or they try to attract you and say ,COMMA we need to mate .PERIOD 
you're going to do that by the way you sign your letter .PERIOD 
you do a number of things :COLON you're a vice president ,COMMA you volunteer ,COMMA you do something else .PERIOD 
why is is this important ?QUESTIONMARK 
because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature :COLON that you have influence in a large sphere ,COMMA and that my preservation depends on you .PERIOD 
here is one very quick hack ,COMMA especially for the feds in the audience .PERIOD 
here's how you mail your letter .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA you send the original to the district office .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you send the copy to the main office .PERIOD 
then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA this is an important letter .PERIOD 
we are harangued ,COMMA lectured to ,COMMA sold ,COMMA marketed ,COMMA but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication .PERIOD 
i got this letter when i was first elected ,COMMA and i still carry it to every council meeting i go to .PERIOD 
this is an opportunity at real dialogue ,COMMA and if you have stewardship and want to communicate ,COMMA that dialogue is incredibly powerful .PERIOD 
so when you do that ,COMMA here's what i can promise :COLON you're going to be the <NUM> pound gorilla in the forest .PERIOD 
get writing .PERIOD 
all buildings today have something in common .PERIOD 
they're made using victorian technologies .PERIOD 
this involves blueprints ,COMMA industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers .PERIOD 
all of this effort results in an inert object .PERIOD 
and that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities .PERIOD 
this is not sustainable .PERIOD 
i believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature ,COMMA not insulating them from it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA in order to do this ,COMMA we need the right kind of language .PERIOD 
and this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .PERIOD 
but they don't exist .PERIOD so i'm having to make them .PERIOD 
i'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture ,COMMA and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .PERIOD 
that means we're generating them from scratch .PERIOD 
one of our collaborators is chemist martin hanczyc ,COMMA and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA martin ,COMMA he works with a system called the protocell .PERIOD 
now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag .PERIOD and it's got a chemical battery in it .PERIOD 
and it has no dna .PERIOD 
this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living .PERIOD 
so here we are .PERIOD these are protocells ,COMMA patterning their environment .PERIOD 
we don't know how they do that yet .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this looks like a chemical kind of birth .PERIOD 
this is a violent process .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate .PERIOD 
and that's the shell around that globular fat .PERIOD 
they are quite brittle .PERIOD so you've only got a part of one there .PERIOD 
so what we're trying to do is ,COMMA we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture ,COMMA which contrast the current ,COMMA victorian ,COMMA top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .PERIOD 
that can't be energetically sensible .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA bottom-up materials actually exist today .PERIOD 
they've been in use ,COMMA in architecture ,COMMA since ancient times .PERIOD 
if you walk around the city of oxford ,COMMA where we are today ,COMMA and have a look at the brickwork ,COMMA which i've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days ,COMMA you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone .PERIOD 
and if you look even closer ,COMMA you'll see ,COMMA in that limestone ,COMMA there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other .PERIOD 
and then they are fossilized over millions of years .PERIOD 
now a block of limestone ,COMMA in itself ,COMMA isn't particularly that interesting .PERIOD 
it looks beautiful .PERIOD 
but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere .PERIOD 
maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
would it give this block of limestone new properties ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA most likely it would .PERIOD it might be able to grow .PERIOD 
it might be able to self-repair ,COMMA and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material .PERIOD 
they think big .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
so when we think about scaling up metabolic materials ,COMMA we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls ,COMMA or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA venice ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA has a tempestuous relationship with the sea ,COMMA and is built upon wooden piles .PERIOD 
so we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim venice .PERIOD 
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA here is the technology we have today .PERIOD 
this is our protocell technology ,COMMA effectively making a shell ,COMMA like its limestone forefathers ,COMMA and depositing it in a very complex environment ,COMMA against natural materials .PERIOD 
we're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is the very interesting part .PERIOD 
we don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals .PERIOD 
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light ,COMMA toward the dark foundations .PERIOD 
we've observed this in the laboratory .PERIOD 
they can actually also move towards the light .PERIOD you have to just choose your species .PERIOD 
so that these don't just exist as one entity ,COMMA we kind of chemically engineer them .PERIOD 
and so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically ,COMMA around the foundations of venice ,COMMA effectively petrifying it .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this isn't going to happen tomorrow .PERIOD it's going to take a while .PERIOD 
it's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice .PERIOD 
but gradually ,COMMA as the buildings are repaired ,COMMA we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city .PERIOD 
an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
also it will attract the local marine ecology ,COMMA who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture .PERIOD 
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .PERIOD 
this is terrestrial chemistry .PERIOD we've all got it ,COMMA which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA in summary ,COMMA i'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies ,COMMA and building architectures from a bottom-up approach .PERIOD 
secondly ,COMMA these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems ,COMMA which means they can perform in similar ways .PERIOD 
they can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
as a boy ,COMMA i loved cars .PERIOD 
when i turned <NUM> ,COMMA i lost my best friend to a car accident .PERIOD 
like this .PERIOD 
and then i decided i'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year .PERIOD 
now i haven't succeeded ,COMMA so this is just a progress report ,COMMA but i'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars .PERIOD 
i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the us .PERIOD government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert .PERIOD 
and even though a hundred teams were there ,COMMA these cars went nowhere .PERIOD 
so we decided at stanford to build a different self-driving car .PERIOD 
we built the hardware and the software .PERIOD 
we made it learn from us ,COMMA and we set it free in the desert .PERIOD 
and the unimaginable happened :COLON it became the first car to ever return from a darpa grand challenge ,COMMA winning stanford <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
yet i still hadn't saved a single life .PERIOD 
since ,COMMA our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in california .PERIOD 
we've driven <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving .PERIOD 
it's the perfect driving mechanism .PERIOD 
we've driven in cities ,COMMA like in san francisco here .PERIOD 
we've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway <NUM> .PERIOD 
we've encountered joggers ,COMMA busy highways ,COMMA toll booths ,COMMA and this is without a person in the loop ;SEMICOLON the car just drives itself .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA while we drove <NUM> miles ,COMMA people didn't even notice .PERIOD 
mountain roads ,COMMA day and night ,COMMA and even crooked lombard street in san francisco .PERIOD 
sometimes our cars get so crazy ,COMMA they even do little stunts .PERIOD 
man :COLON oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD 
what ?QUESTIONMARK 
second man :COLON it's driving itself .PERIOD 
sebastian thrun :COLON now i can't get my friend harold back to life ,COMMA but i can do something for all the people who died .PERIOD 
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?QUESTIONMARK 
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error ,COMMA and can therefore be prevented by machines ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes ,COMMA and do away with all traffic jams on highways ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you realize that you ,COMMA ted users ,COMMA spend an average of <NUM> minutes per day in traffic ,COMMA wasting your time on your daily commute ?QUESTIONMARK 
you could regain this time .PERIOD 
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .PERIOD 
and it's <NUM> billion gallons of gasoline wasted .PERIOD 
now i think there's a vision here ,COMMA a new technology ,COMMA and i'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
this is a stream .PERIOD 
this is a river .PERIOD 
this is happening all over the country .PERIOD 
there are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the united states .PERIOD 
on this map ,COMMA the colored areas represent water conflicts .PERIOD 
similar problems are emerging in the east as well .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> miles of dewatered streams in montana alone .PERIOD 
they would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife .PERIOD 
they're the veins of the ecosystem ,COMMA and they're often empty veins .PERIOD 
i want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story .PERIOD 
this is prickly pear creek .PERIOD 
it runs through a populated area from east helena to lake helena .PERIOD 
it supports wild fish including cutthroat ,COMMA brown and rainbow trout .PERIOD 
nearly every year for more than a hundred years ,COMMA it's looked like this in the summer .PERIOD 
how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like montana .PERIOD 
in short ,COMMA there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people .PERIOD 
it basically said ,COMMA everybody near the stream can share in the stream .PERIOD 
oddly ,COMMA a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream ,COMMA and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers .PERIOD 
there were precedent-setting suits in <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA both involving prickly pear creek .PERIOD 
and in <NUM> ,COMMA the montana supreme court ruled in a case involving prickly pear that the folks who were there first had the first ,COMMA or senior water rights .PERIOD 
these senior water rights are key .PERIOD 
the problem is that all over the west now it looks like this .PERIOD 
some of these creeks have claims for <NUM> to <NUM> times more water than is actually in the stream .PERIOD 
and the senior water rights holders ,COMMA if they don't use their water right ,COMMA they risk losing their water right ,COMMA along with the economic value that goes with it .PERIOD 
so they have no incentive to conserve .PERIOD 
so it's not just about the number of people ;SEMICOLON the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you don't use it .PERIOD 
so after decades of lawsuits and <NUM> years ,COMMA now ,COMMA of experience ,COMMA we still have this .PERIOD 
it's a broken system .PERIOD 
there's a disincentive to conserve ,COMMA because ,COMMA if you don't use your water right ,COMMA you can lose your water right .PERIOD 
and i'm sure you all know ,COMMA this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD now i'm going to change gears here .PERIOD 
most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation's free ,COMMA and some of you'll be happy to know that it involves beer .PERIOD 
they're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water ,COMMA they're trying to be really efficient with their water use ,COMMA and they're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA it's a national problem ,COMMA but i'm going to tell you another story from montana ,COMMA and it involves beer .PERIOD 
i bet you didn't know ,COMMA it takes about <NUM> pints of water to make a pint of beer .PERIOD 
if you include all the drain ,COMMA it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer .PERIOD 
now the brewers in montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption ,COMMA but they still use millions of gallons of water .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA there's water in beer .PERIOD 
these ecosystems are really important to the montana brewers and their customers .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA there's a strong correlation between water and fishing ,COMMA and for some ,COMMA there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer .PERIOD 
so the montana brewers and their customers are concerned ,COMMA and they're looking for some way to address the problem .PERIOD 
so how can they address this remaining water footprint ?QUESTIONMARK 
remember prickly pear .PERIOD 
up until now ,COMMA business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing ,COMMA and we're suggesting that the next step is to restore .PERIOD 
remember prickly pear .PERIOD 
it's a broken system .PERIOD 
you've got a disincentive to conserve ,COMMA because if you don't use your water right ,COMMA you risk losing your water right .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks .PERIOD 
in some states ,COMMA senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right .PERIOD 
after all ,COMMA it is their water right ,COMMA and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream ,COMMA it's their right to do so .PERIOD 
but they have no incentive to do so .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA working with local water trusts ,COMMA we created an incentive to do so .PERIOD 
we pay them to leave their water in-stream .PERIOD 
that's what's happening here .PERIOD 
this individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion ,COMMA leaving the water in the stream .PERIOD 
because he's the senior water rights holder ,COMMA he can protect the water from other users in the stream .PERIOD 
okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
he gets paid to leave the water in the stream .PERIOD 
we then take the measured water ,COMMA we divide it into thousand-gallon increments .PERIOD 
each increment gets a serial number and a certificate ,COMMA and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems .PERIOD 
the brewers pay to restore water to the stream .PERIOD 
it provides a simple ,COMMA inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems ,COMMA while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them .PERIOD 
after <NUM> years of conflict and <NUM> years of dry streams ,COMMA a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved ,COMMA we put together a market-based ,COMMA willing buyer ,COMMA willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation .PERIOD 
it's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed ,COMMA into these degraded ecosystems ,COMMA while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used .PERIOD 
these transactions create allies ,COMMA not enemies .PERIOD 
they connect people rather than dividing them .PERIOD 
and they provide needed economic support for rural communities .PERIOD 
and most importantly ,COMMA it's working .PERIOD 
we've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems .PERIOD 
we've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana ,COMMA with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest .PERIOD 
and when we make these connections ,COMMA we can and we do turn this into this .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
so what does the happiest man in the world look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
he certainly doesn't look like me .PERIOD 
he looks like this .PERIOD 
his name is matthieu ricard .PERIOD 
so how do you get to be the happiest man in the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain .PERIOD 
and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fmri ,COMMA versus the right prefrontal cortex .PERIOD 
and matthieu's happiness measure is off the charts .PERIOD 
which leads us to a question :COLON what was he thinking when he was being measured ?QUESTIONMARK 
perhaps something very naughty .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA he was meditating on compassion .PERIOD 
matthieu's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever .PERIOD 
reading about matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life .PERIOD 
my dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale .PERIOD 
and learning about matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work .PERIOD 
matthieu's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore .PERIOD 
compassion is something that creates happiness .PERIOD 
and that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game .PERIOD 
because if compassion was a chore ,COMMA nobody's going to do it ,COMMA except maybe the dalai lama or something .PERIOD 
but if compassion was fun ,COMMA everybody's going to do it .PERIOD 
but fun is not enough .PERIOD 
what if compassion is also profitable ?QUESTIONMARK 
what if compassion is also good for business ?QUESTIONMARK 
then ,COMMA every boss ,COMMA every manager in the world ,COMMA will want to have compassion -- like this .PERIOD 
that would create the conditions for world peace .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting .PERIOD 
fortunately ,COMMA i didn't have to look very far .PERIOD 
because what i was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in google ,COMMA my company .PERIOD 
i know there are other compassionate companies in the world ,COMMA but google is the place i'm familiar with because i've been there for <NUM> years ,COMMA so i'll use google as the case study .PERIOD 
google is a company born of idealism .PERIOD 
it's a company that thrives on idealism .PERIOD 
and maybe because of that ,COMMA compassion is organic and widespread company-wide .PERIOD 
in google ,COMMA expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern .PERIOD 
it's sort of a funny pattern .PERIOD 
it starts with a small group of googlers taking the initiative to do something .PERIOD 
and they don't usually ask for permission ;SEMICOLON they just go ahead and do it ,COMMA and then other googlers join in ,COMMA and it just gets bigger and bigger .PERIOD 
and sometimes it gets big enough to become official .PERIOD 
so in other words ,COMMA it almost always starts from the bottom up .PERIOD 
and let me give you some examples .PERIOD 
the first example is the largest annual community event -- where googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official ,COMMA because it just became too big .PERIOD 
another example ,COMMA three googlers -- a chef ,COMMA an engineer and ,COMMA most funny ,COMMA a massage therapist -- three of them ,COMMA they learned about a region in india where <NUM> people live without a single medical facility .PERIOD 
so what do they do ?QUESTIONMARK 
they just go ahead and start a fundraiser .PERIOD 
and they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for <NUM> people .PERIOD 
during the haiti earthquake ,COMMA a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones .PERIOD 
and expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices .PERIOD 
in china for example ,COMMA one mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in china ,COMMA involving more than <NUM> schools in china ,COMMA working on issues such as education ,COMMA poverty ,COMMA health care and the environment .PERIOD 
there is so much organic social action all around google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts .PERIOD 
and this idea ,COMMA again ,COMMA came from the grassroots ,COMMA from two googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job .PERIOD 
and i found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy .PERIOD 
it was two persons saying ,COMMA let's do this ,COMMA and the company said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
so it turns out that google is a compassionate company ,COMMA because googlers found compassion to be fun .PERIOD 
but again ,COMMA fun is not enough .PERIOD 
there are also real business benefits .PERIOD 
so what are they ?QUESTIONMARK 
the first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders .PERIOD 
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are three components of compassion .PERIOD 
there is the affective component ,COMMA which is ,COMMA i feel for you .PERIOD 
there is the cognitive component ,COMMA which is ,COMMA i understand you .PERIOD 
and there is a motivational component ,COMMA which is ,COMMA i want to help you .PERIOD 
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?QUESTIONMARK 
according to a very comprehensive study led by jim collins ,COMMA and documented in the book good to great ,COMMA it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness .PERIOD 
and he calls them level <NUM> leaders .PERIOD 
these are leaders who ,COMMA in addition to being highly capable ,COMMA possess two important qualities ,COMMA and they are humility and ambition .PERIOD 
and because they're ambitious for a greater good ,COMMA they feel no need to inflate their own egos .PERIOD 
the motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA compassion is the way to grow level <NUM> leaders .PERIOD 
and this is the first compelling business benefit .PERIOD 
the second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce .PERIOD 
employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good .PERIOD 
it creates a vibrant ,COMMA energetic community where people admire and respect each other .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you come to work in the morning ,COMMA and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india .PERIOD 
it's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers ?QUESTIONMARK 
so this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration ,COMMA initiative and creativity .PERIOD 
it makes us a highly effective company .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA having said all that ,COMMA what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting ?QUESTIONMARK 
in our experience ,COMMA there are three ingredients .PERIOD 
the first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good .PERIOD 
so always think :COLON how is your company and your job serving the greater good ?QUESTIONMARK 
or ,COMMA how can you further serve the greater good ?QUESTIONMARK 
so in google ,COMMA there's a lot of autonomy .PERIOD 
and one of our most popular managers jokes that ,COMMA this is what he says ,COMMA google is a place where the inmates run the asylum .PERIOD 
and he considers himself one of the inmates .PERIOD 
if you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free ,COMMA they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way .PERIOD 
the third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth .PERIOD 
leadership training in google ,COMMA for example ,COMMA places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities ,COMMA such as self-awareness ,COMMA self-mastery ,COMMA empathy and compassion ,COMMA because we believe that leadership begins with character .PERIOD 
we even created a seven-week curriculum on emotion intelligence ,COMMA which we jokingly call searching inside yourself .PERIOD 
it's less naughty than it sounds .PERIOD 
so i'm an engineer by training ,COMMA but i'm one of the creators and instructors of this course ,COMMA which i find kind of funny ,COMMA because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence .PERIOD 
what a company .PERIOD 
so search inside yourself -- how does it work ?QUESTIONMARK 
it works in three steps .PERIOD 
the first step is attention training .PERIOD 
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training .PERIOD 
the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time .PERIOD 
and this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence .PERIOD 
the second step follows the first step .PERIOD 
the second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery .PERIOD 
so using the supercharged attention from step one ,COMMA we create a high-resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes .PERIOD 
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
it means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity ,COMMA objectivity and from a third-person perspective .PERIOD 
and once you can do that ,COMMA you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery .PERIOD 
the third step ,COMMA following the second step ,COMMA is to create new mental habits .PERIOD 
what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK imagine this .PERIOD 
imagine whenever you meet any other person ,COMMA any time you meet a person ,COMMA your habitual ,COMMA instinctive first thought is ,COMMA i want you to be happy .PERIOD 
i want you to be happy .PERIOD 
imagine you can do that .PERIOD 
having this habit ,COMMA this mental habit ,COMMA changes everything at work .PERIOD 
because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people ,COMMA and it creates trust ,COMMA and trust creates a lot of good working relationships .PERIOD 
someday ,COMMA we hope to open-source search inside yourself so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference .PERIOD 
and in closing ,COMMA i want to end the same place i started ,COMMA with happiness .PERIOD 
i want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes ,COMMA not the other guy -- the dalai lama ,COMMA who said ,COMMA if you want others to be happy ,COMMA practice compassion .PERIOD 
if you want to be happy ,COMMA practice compassion .PERIOD 
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA i walked into a prison in cambodia ,COMMA and i met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .PERIOD 
and as i looked into his eyes ,COMMA i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written for political prisoners ,COMMA that i would never have written a letter for him ,COMMA because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .PERIOD 
he was not a political prisoner .PERIOD 
he was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .PERIOD 
what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cambodia ,COMMA but of the <NUM> developing countries that torture ,COMMA <NUM> of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .PERIOD 
it is for people who are in broken-down legal systems ,COMMA and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it's cheaper than having a legal system ,COMMA cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time .PERIOD 
i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community ,COMMA if we make a decision ,COMMA to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime ,COMMA but it will require three things .PERIOD 
first is the training ,COMMA empowerment ,COMMA and connection of defenders worldwide .PERIOD 
the second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .PERIOD 
and the third is commitment .PERIOD 
so in the year <NUM> ,COMMA i began to wonder ,COMMA what if we came together ?QUESTIONMARK 
could we do something for these <NUM> countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i founded international bridges to justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the <NUM> countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .PERIOD 
my first experiences ,COMMA though ,COMMA did come from cambodia ,COMMA and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA still less than <NUM> attorneys in the country because the khmer rouge had killed them all .PERIOD 
and even <NUM> years later ,COMMA there was only <NUM> lawyers in the country ,COMMA so consequently you'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys ,COMMA you'd meet women and you'd say ,COMMA why are you here ?QUESTIONMARK women would say ,COMMA well i've been here for <NUM> years because my husband committed a crime ,COMMA but they can't find him .PERIOD 
the first group of defenders came together and i still remember ,COMMA as i was training ,COMMA i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what do you do for an investigation ?QUESTIONMARK 
and there was silence in the class ,COMMA and finally one woman stood up ,COMMA [inaudible name] ,COMMA and she said khrew ,COMMA which means teacher .PERIOD 
she said ,COMMA i have defended more than a hundred people ,COMMA and i've never had to do any investigation ,COMMA because they all come with confessions .PERIOD 
and we talked about ,COMMA as a class ,COMMA the fact that number one ,COMMA the confessions might not be reliable ,COMMA but number two ,COMMA we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this ,COMMA especially as it was now against the law .PERIOD 
and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .PERIOD 
and i still remember the first cases where they came ,COMMA all <NUM> together ,COMMA she would stand up ,COMMA and they were in the back ,COMMA and they would support her ,COMMA and the judges kept saying ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA we're going to do things the exact same way we've been doing them .PERIOD 
but one day the perfect case came ,COMMA and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller ,COMMA she was sitting outside of a house .PERIOD 
she said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was ,COMMA but the police came ,COMMA they got her ,COMMA there was nothing on her .PERIOD 
she was pregnant at the time .PERIOD she had cigarette burns on her .PERIOD she'd miscarried .PERIOD 
and when they brought her case to the judge ,COMMA for the first time he stood up and he said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA there's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released .PERIOD 
and the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see ,COMMA they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia .PERIOD 
but cambodia is not alone .PERIOD 
i used to think ,COMMA well is it cambodia ?QUESTIONMARK 
or is it other countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
but it is in so many countries .PERIOD 
or a woman ,COMMA i picked up her baby ,COMMA really cute baby ,COMMA i said your baby is so cute .PERIOD 
it wasn't a baby ,COMMA she was three .PERIOD 
and she said yeah ,COMMA but she's why i'm here ,COMMA because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .PERIOD 
a judge would let her out .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA we can talk about it ,COMMA but look at my prison .PERIOD eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer .PERIOD what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .PERIOD 
but we realized that it's not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA in cambodia ,COMMA it was that [inaudible name] did not go alone but she had <NUM> lawyers with her who stood up together .PERIOD and in the same way ,COMMA in china ,COMMA they always tell me ,COMMA it's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together .PERIOD 
or in zimbabwe ,COMMA where i remember innocent ,COMMA after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said ,COMMA i've been here for one year ,COMMA eight years ,COMMA <NUM> years without a lawyer ,COMMA he came and we had a training together and he said ,COMMA i have heard it said -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- i have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources .PERIOD 
and then he said ,COMMA but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice .PERIOD 
and with that ,COMMA he successfully organized <NUM> lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .PERIOD 
the key that we see ,COMMA though ,COMMA is training and then early access .PERIOD 
i was recently in egypt ,COMMA and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers ,COMMA and what they told me is that they said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA look ,COMMA we don't have police on the streets now .PERIOD the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution .PERIOD they were torturing everybody all the time .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA but there's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .PERIOD 
what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
i met with one of the development agencies ,COMMA and they were training prosecutors and judges ,COMMA which is the normal bias ,COMMA as opposed to defenders .PERIOD 
and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA i'm gonna copy this .PERIOD 
it had everything in it .PERIOD lawyers can come at the police station .PERIOD it was perfect .PERIOD 
prosecutors were perfectly trained .PERIOD 
but i said to them ,COMMA i just have one question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor's office ,COMMA what had happened to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
and after a pause ,COMMA they said ,COMMA they had been tortured .PERIOD 
and as i tell you this ,COMMA i'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA okay ,COMMA it sounds like we could do it ,COMMA but can we really do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
because it sounds big .PERIOD 
and there are many reasons why i believe it's possible .PERIOD 
the first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .PERIOD 
it's not only innocent ,COMMA who i told you about in zimbabwe ,COMMA but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .PERIOD 
we have a program called justicemakers ,COMMA and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things ,COMMA but how can we support them ?QUESTIONMARK 
so it's an online contest where it's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .PERIOD 
and there are <NUM> justicemakers throughout the world ,COMMA from sri lanka to swaziland to the drc ,COMMA who with five thousand dollars do amazing things ,COMMA through sms programs ,COMMA through paralegal programs ,COMMA through whatever they can do .PERIOD 
and it's not only these justicemakers ,COMMA but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .PERIOD 
so in china ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .PERIOD 
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers ,COMMA and said ,COMMA how can we get this out ?QUESTIONMARK how can we make sure that this is implemented ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is fantastic .PERIOD and he said to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA do you have money ?QUESTIONMARK and i said ,COMMA no .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA that's okay ,COMMA we can still figure it out .PERIOD 
and on december <NUM> ,COMMA he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league ,COMMA from <NUM> of the top law schools ,COMMA who organized themselves ,COMMA developed posters with the new laws ,COMMA and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .PERIOD 
so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .PERIOD 
we need to systematically implement early access to counsel .PERIOD 
and people often say to me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is great ,COMMA but it's wildly idealistic .PERIOD 
never going to happen .PERIOD 
it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there's one of our favorite poems from the defenders ,COMMA which they share from each other ,COMMA is :COLON take courage friends ,COMMA the road is often long ,COMMA the path is never clear ,COMMA and the stakes are very high ,COMMA but deep down ,COMMA you are not alone .PERIOD 
and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders ,COMMA but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it ,COMMA we can end torture as an investigative tool .PERIOD 
i end always ,COMMA because i'm sure the questions are -- and i'd be happy to talk to you at any point -- but what can i really do ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA i would say this .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA you know what you can do .PERIOD but second of all ,COMMA i would leave you with the story of vishna ,COMMA who actually was my inspiration for starting international bridges to justice .PERIOD 
vishna was a 4-year-old boy when i met him who was born in a cambodian prison in kandal province .PERIOD but because he was born in the prison ,COMMA everybody loved him ,COMMA including the guards ,COMMA so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA he never quite made it to all of them every day ,COMMA but he wanted to visit all <NUM> prisoners .PERIOD and i would lift him ,COMMA and he would put his fingers through .PERIOD 
or if they were dark cells ,COMMA it was like iron corrugated ,COMMA and he would put his fingers through .PERIOD 
and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine ,COMMA and they looked forward to him .PERIOD and i was like ,COMMA here's vishna .PERIOD he's a 4-year-old boy .PERIOD 
he was born in a prison with almost nothing ,COMMA no material goods ,COMMA but he had a sense of his own heroic journey ,COMMA which i believe we are all born into .PERIOD he said ,COMMA probably i can't do everything .PERIOD 
but i'm one .PERIOD i can do something .PERIOD 
so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together ,COMMA and invite you into this journey with us .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .PERIOD 
and in my idea ,COMMA heaven is satisfied curiosity .PERIOD 
i think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where i can just lie down with my belly down ,COMMA like i was watching tv when i was a child ,COMMA and my elbows up .PERIOD 
and i can basically look everywhere i want ,COMMA see every movie i've always wanted to see .PERIOD 
and in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you're reading ,COMMA there's something really soothing and easy .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the funny thing is that i already have that kind of life ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA because i discovered . .PERIOD 
it took me a while to understand it ,COMMA but when i discovered around <NUM> years of age that i was much more comfortable with objects than with people ,COMMA i finally decided to really embrace this passion .PERIOD 
and i basically live my life in sort of a trance ,COMMA and i look around and everything i see is just the beginning of a long story .PERIOD 
just to give you an example :COLON this is the exhibition ,COMMA humble masterpieces ,COMMA as it was at moma in <NUM> .PERIOD 
that was one of the funnest moments of my career .PERIOD 
the typeface -- the typeface is helvetica ;SEMICOLON it's its 50th anniversary this year .PERIOD 
and so i start thinking -- max miedinger and all those swiss designers together ,COMMA trying to outdo akzidenz-grotesk ,COMMA and come up with a new sans-serif typeface -- and the movie starts playing in my head already .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA you can imagine ,COMMA with humble masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred .PERIOD 
and i do hope ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you .PERIOD 
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing . .PERIOD 
you know when they do homeworks at home ?QUESTIONMARK 
instead of having a tray with two peas ,COMMA i was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces ,COMMA and at moma we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces .PERIOD 
and when you do that ,COMMA usually you get <NUM> percent porn and <NUM> percent real suggestions ,COMMA and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions .PERIOD 
and a lot of nationalism came in .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA i didn't know that the spaniards invented the mop ,COMMA but they were very proud so every spaniard said la frego .PERIOD and italians did the pizza .PERIOD 
and i wanted to show you ,COMMA also ,COMMA the suggestions from kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine ,COMMA laundry detergents and liquid nails .PERIOD 
and i keep it going ,COMMA and i just got ,COMMA also ,COMMA this suggestion from milan :COLON it's our traffic divider ,COMMA which we call panettone ,COMMA and it's painted ;SEMICOLON it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around milan to define all the lanes of traffic .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA think of your own ,COMMA send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome .PERIOD 
but an exhibition like that made me understand even more what i've been thinking of for <NUM> years ever since i got to moma .PERIOD 
i'm italian .PERIOD in italy ,COMMA design is normal .PERIOD 
different parts of the world have a knack for different things .PERIOD 
i was just recently in argentina and in uruguay ,COMMA and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you don't see elsewhere ,COMMA but the contemporary art was terrible .PERIOD 
but design -- oh ,COMMA my god .PERIOD 
what you find at the store at the corner ,COMMA without going to any kind of fancy store ,COMMA is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated .PERIOD 
it's just what you find at the store .PERIOD 
and new york has another kind of knack for contemporary art .PERIOD 
i'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who richard serra is and take you to the galleries .PERIOD 
but design ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA is still misunderstood for decoration .PERIOD 
it's really interesting :COLON what many people think when i say the word design is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case ,COMMA it's overdesigned on purpose ,COMMA but -- decoration ,COMMA interior decoration .PERIOD 
they think of somebody choosing fabrics .PERIOD 
design can be that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but it can also be this .PERIOD 
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people ,COMMA because ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline ,COMMA so that instead of being completely strangled ,COMMA a teenager can also sip a coke .PERIOD 
and then they make a little tent for the baby .PERIOD 
however cruel ,COMMA however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design ,COMMA and it is miles away from the fancy furniture ,COMMA but still ,COMMA it's part of my same field of passion .PERIOD 
what i've been doing at moma since the beginning is to try to harness the power of moma because it's great to work there .PERIOD you really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions ,COMMA and that is power because in a design museum i wouldn't have as many visitors .PERIOD 
i'm very well aware that <NUM> percent of my public is there to see picasso and matisse ,COMMA and then they stumble upon my show and i keep them there .PERIOD 
but what i've been trying to do is something that the curators at moma in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in <NUM> ,COMMA which is to try and see what's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better .PERIOD 
there have been many episodes ,COMMA and actually eames demetrius may be here in the audience ,COMMA but in two instances ,COMMA his great-grandfather ,COMMA grandfather -- i'm always a little perplexed about the relation ,COMMA exactly -- charles eames the first time and then charles and ray eames the second time were involved in two competitions :COLON one in <NUM> ,COMMA it was about organic furniture ,COMMA and the second one in <NUM> was low-cost furniture for the gis coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture .PERIOD 
and then there was good design for very low price .PERIOD 
there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i started out in '<NUM> with this exhibition that was called mutant materials in contemporary design .PERIOD 
it was about a new phase ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves .PERIOD 
and that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the lawrence livermore lab in california ;SEMICOLON at that time ,COMMA they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market .PERIOD 
and at the same time ,COMMA the gorgeous work of takeshi ishiguro ,COMMA who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough .PERIOD 
so you see ,COMMA the range is really quite diverse .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA this other exhibition that was entitled workspheres in <NUM> ,COMMA where i asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time .PERIOD 
and you see ideo there .PERIOD 
it was beautiful -- it was called personal skies .PERIOD 
the idea was that if you had a cubicle ,COMMA you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own cielo in una stanza -- a sky in a room -- it's a very famous italian song .PERIOD 
and other examples :COLON this was marti guixe about working on the go ,COMMA and hella jongerius ,COMMA my favorite ,COMMA about how to work at home .PERIOD 
and this lets me introduce a very important idea about design :COLON designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world .PERIOD 
what they do best is make a synthesis of human needs ,COMMA current conditions in economy ,COMMA in materials ,COMMA in sustainability issues ,COMMA and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts .PERIOD 
hella jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious .PERIOD 
the idea behind her work was that at that time ,COMMA everybody was saying you have to really divide your life .PERIOD 
there have been many other exhibitions in the meantime ,COMMA but i don't want to focus on my shows .PERIOD 
i've always had a hard time with the word maverick .PERIOD 
i came to the united states <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and to this day i have to ask ,COMMA what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA this morning i went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle .PERIOD 
therefore ,COMMA he was not following everybody's lead ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA he was a maverick .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA designers do need to be mavericks ,COMMA because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA safe is the last exhibition that i did at moma and it ended at the beginning of last year .PERIOD 
it was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection .PERIOD 
and then when <NUM>/<NUM> happened ,COMMA i had a shock and i canceled the exhibition until ,COMMA slowly but surely ,COMMA it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety .PERIOD 
but it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to these kind of water-sterilizing straws ,COMMA so it was really wide-ranging .PERIOD 
it also had . .PERIOD you know ,COMMA cameron and i worked a little bit together ,COMMA and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition .PERIOD 
but what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore ;SEMICOLON design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point .PERIOD 
it's a sense of economy and a sense ,COMMA also ,COMMA of humor .PERIOD 
this is a beautiful project by ralph borland ,COMMA who's south african .PERIOD 
it's a suit for civil disobedience .PERIOD 
the idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you ,COMMA you're wearing this thing -- it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified -- and the police is reminded ;SEMICOLON it's like having a flower in front of the rifle .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA you can imagine ,COMMA a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police .PERIOD 
tony dunne and fiona raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia ,COMMA like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away ;SEMICOLON or even better ,COMMA the huggable atomic mushroom ,COMMA which got me an article on the bulletin of atomic scientists of the united states -- i don't think it ever happened before at moma ;SEMICOLON or this faraday chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations .PERIOD 
but the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self ,COMMA and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic .PERIOD 
they are athletic gear for muslim women that enable them to ski ,COMMA play tennis ,COMMA do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves .PERIOD 
and sometimes by doing this kind of research ,COMMA you encounter such beautiful ideas of design .PERIOD 
twan verdonck is really young ,COMMA i think he's <NUM> ,COMMA and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments .PERIOD 
they're quite beautiful .PERIOD 
i was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the herald tribune in istanbul .PERIOD 
and the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury ,COMMA and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much .PERIOD 
i want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very ,COMMA very clear limits .PERIOD 
this is cuba ,COMMA and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell ,COMMA and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks .PERIOD 
so they're quite beautiful ,COMMA but they're beautiful because they're so smart and economical .PERIOD 
and here is the work of two brothers from sao paulo ,COMMA fernando and humberto campana ,COMMA who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money .PERIOD 
but that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself .PERIOD 
so really ,COMMA design takes everything into account ,COMMA and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances ,COMMA as we become more and more wireless and impalpable ,COMMA designers ,COMMA instead ,COMMA want us to be hands-on .PERIOD 
sometimes hammer-on .PERIOD 
this is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically .PERIOD 
even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint ,COMMA all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by ana mir in barcelona .PERIOD 
from this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes .PERIOD 
it's quite beautiful because somehow ,COMMA this is a gorgeous moment for design .PERIOD 
many years ago i heard a mathematician from vienna ,COMMA whose name was marchetti ,COMMA explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore ,COMMA secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed .PERIOD 
and that makes sense .PERIOD 
in moments of war there's great technological innovation ,COMMA and in the world you have to do without -- well ,COMMA during the second world war ,COMMA you had to do without steel ,COMMA you had to do without aluminum .PERIOD 
and then as peace comes ,COMMA all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market .PERIOD 
many of you might know that the potato chip chair by charles and ray eames comes exactly from that kind of instance :COLON fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden .PERIOD 
i think that this is a strange moment .PERIOD 
but it surely is a very important moment for design ,COMMA because not only is the technology proceeding ,COMMA not only is computing technology making open-source possible also in the world of design ,COMMA but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of co2 emissions and footprint ,COMMA but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers .PERIOD 
and that's why designers ,COMMA more and more ,COMMA are working on behaviors rather than on objects .PERIOD 
especially the good ones ,COMMA not all of them .PERIOD 
i wanted to show you ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA the work of mathieu lehanneur ,COMMA which is quite fantastic .PERIOD 
he's another young designer from france who's working -- and at this point he's working ,COMMA also ,COMMA with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients ,COMMA especially children ,COMMA in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine ,COMMA so the child has to go -- pffff !EXCLAMATIONMARK -- to release and relieve the container itself .PERIOD 
and this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin ,COMMA so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery .PERIOD 
similarly ,COMMA there's the work of people like marti guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste ,COMMA orally .PERIOD 
the next show that i'm going to work on -- and i've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science .PERIOD 
i'm trying to find not the metaphors ,COMMA but ,COMMA rather ,COMMA the points in common -- the common gripes ,COMMA the common issues ,COMMA the common preoccupations -- and i think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction ,COMMA as a direction rather than a prescription of form .PERIOD 
and i am hoping that many of you will respond to this .PERIOD 
i've sent an email already to quite a few of you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so what's image got do with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i must say ,COMMA i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages ,COMMA because i'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up .PERIOD 
but i'm going to try and do something different ,COMMA and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories ,COMMA and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about .PERIOD 
we're not the only ones .PERIOD 
and you know ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent .PERIOD 
just think about that ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is typically what we've been talking about ,COMMA the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA why is that a problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
a typical disaster story :COLON disease ,COMMA corruption ,COMMA poverty .PERIOD 
and some of you might be standing here thinking ,COMMA saying ,COMMA ok ,COMMA you know ,COMMA ory ,COMMA you're harvard-educated ,COMMA and all you privileged people come here ,COMMA saying ,COMMA 'forget the poor people .PERIOD 
let's focus on business and the markets ,COMMA and whatever' and they're all ,COMMA there's the <NUM> percent of africans who really need help .PERIOD 
we start with poverty .PERIOD 
i didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire ,COMMA but i know what it is to grow up without having money ,COMMA or being able to support family .PERIOD 
euvin was talking about bellwether signs .PERIOD 
the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA when things were good ,COMMA we had eggs and sausages .PERIOD 
when things were bad ,COMMA we had porridge .PERIOD 
and like many african families ,COMMA my parents could never save because they supported siblings ,COMMA cousins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA their parents ,COMMA and things were always dicey .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when i was born ,COMMA they realized they had a pretty smart kid ,COMMA and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school ,COMMA which was free .PERIOD 
and they adopted a very interesting approach to education ,COMMA which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .PERIOD 
so they took me to a private ,COMMA catholic ,COMMA elementary school ,COMMA which set the foundation for what ended up being my career .PERIOD 
and what happened was ,COMMA because they could afford it sometimes ,COMMA sometimes not ,COMMA i got kicked out pretty much every term .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees ,COMMA and when they started getting pretty strict ,COMMA you had to leave ,COMMA until your school fees could be paid .PERIOD 
and i remember thinking ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school ?QUESTIONMARK 
because you know ,COMMA as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive ,COMMA and everyone knows you guys don't have money .PERIOD 
but they kept at it ,COMMA and i now understand why they did what they did .PERIOD 
they talk about corruption .PERIOD 
in kenya ,COMMA we have an entrance exam to go into high school .PERIOD 
and there's national schools ,COMMA which are like the best schools ,COMMA and provincial schools .PERIOD 
my dream school at that time was kenya high school ,COMMA a national school .PERIOD 
i missed the cutoff by one point .PERIOD 
and i was so disappointed ,COMMA and i was like ,COMMA oh my god ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what am i going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
let's go and try and talk to the headmistress .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA it's just one point .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there .PERIOD 
and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him ,COMMA saying ,COMMA you know ,COMMA who do you think you are ?QUESTIONMARK 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you must be joking if you think you can get a slot .PERIOD 
and i had gone to school with other girls ,COMMA who were kids of politicians ,COMMA and who had done much ,COMMA much worse than i did ,COMMA and they had slots there .PERIOD 
and there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we left ,COMMA and i swore to myself ,COMMA and i was like ,COMMA i'm never ,COMMA ever going to have to beg for anything in my life .PERIOD 
they called me two weeks later ,COMMA they're like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA you can come now .PERIOD and i told them to stuff it .PERIOD 
final story ,COMMA and i sort of have to speak quickly .PERIOD 
disease .PERIOD 
my father ,COMMA who i've been talking about ,COMMA died of aids in <NUM> .PERIOD 
he never told anyone that he had aids ,COMMA his fear of the stigma was so strong .PERIOD 
and i'm pretty much the one who figured it out ,COMMA because i was a nerd .PERIOD 
and i was in the states at the time ,COMMA and they called me .PERIOD he was very sick ,COMMA the first time he got sick .PERIOD 
and he had cryptococcal meningitis .PERIOD 
and so i went on to google ,COMMA cryptococcal meningitis ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
because of doctor-patient privilege ,COMMA they couldn't really tell us what was going on .PERIOD 
but they were like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is a long-term thing .PERIOD 
and when i went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease ,COMMA i pretty much realized what was going on .PERIOD 
the first time he got sick ,COMMA he recovered .PERIOD 
but what happened was that he had to be on medication that ,COMMA at that time -- diflucan ,COMMA which in the states is used for yeast infections -- cost <NUM> dollars a pill .PERIOD 
he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA so money ran out .PERIOD 
he got sick again .PERIOD 
and up until that time ,COMMA he had a friend who used to travel to india ,COMMA and he used to import ,COMMA bring him ,COMMA could get him a generic version of it .PERIOD 
and that kept him going .PERIOD 
he got sick again .PERIOD he got sick on a friday .PERIOD 
at that time ,COMMA there was only one bank that had atms in kenya ,COMMA and we could not get cash .PERIOD the family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday .PERIOD 
the hospital put him on a water drip for three days .PERIOD 
and finally ,COMMA we figured ,COMMA well ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital .PERIOD 
at least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation .PERIOD 
and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA now ,COMMA imagine if -- and i could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me .PERIOD 
how would you look at me ?QUESTIONMARK 
with pity ,COMMA you know .PERIOD sadness .PERIOD 
and this is how you look at africa .PERIOD 
this is the damage it causes .PERIOD 
you don't see the other side of me .PERIOD 
and i just wanted to personalize that .PERIOD 
because we talk about it in big terms ,COMMA and you wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so what ?QUESTIONMARK 
but it's damaging .PERIOD 
and i'm not unique ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a poor village .PERIOD 
i was actually crying during his presentation .PERIOD 
he was like ,COMMA i try and i make .PERIOD 
i was like nike should hire him ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and this is ,COMMA again ,COMMA the point i'm trying to make .PERIOD 
when you focus just on the disasters -- -- we're ignoring the potential .PERIOD 
first of all ,COMMA africans ,COMMA we need to get better at telling our stories .PERIOD 
we heard about that yesterday .PERIOD 
we had some of them this morning .PERIOD 
afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that was developed in south africa .PERIOD 
if no one else will tell our stories ,COMMA let's do it .PERIOD 
it only has five contributors .PERIOD 
four of them are white males -- non-native speakers .PERIOD 
the other person is -- ndesanjo ,COMMA if you're here ,COMMA stand up -- is a tanzanian ,COMMA [the] first swahili blogger .PERIOD 
he's the only african who's contributing to this .PERIOD 
people ,COMMA please .PERIOD we can't whine and complain the west is doing this .PERIOD 
what are we doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
where are the rest of the swahili speakers ?QUESTIONMARK 
why are we not generating our own content ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA it's not enough to complain .PERIOD we need to act .PERIOD 
reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa .PERIOD 
the cheetah generation .PERIOD 
the aid approach ,COMMA you know ,COMMA is flawed .PERIOD 
and after all the hoopla of live <NUM> ,COMMA we're still not anywhere in the picture .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA you're not .PERIOD 
but the point i'm trying to make ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that it's not enough for us to criticize .PERIOD 
and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be ,COMMA should i move back ,COMMA should i stay ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA just jump .PERIOD 
the continent needs you .PERIOD 
and i can't emphasize that enough ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
with two paychecks ,COMMA or three paychecks ,COMMA i could solve a lot of my family's problems .PERIOD 
but i walked away from that ,COMMA because my passion was here ,COMMA and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling .PERIOD 
and because i'm needed here ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
i probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i'm doing .PERIOD 
one is because i'm pretty aggressive ,COMMA and i try and find ,COMMA you know ,COMMA opportunities .PERIOD 
but there is such a need ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa .PERIOD 
we're now moving into east africa .PERIOD 
and we give them business development services ,COMMA as well as financing loan and equity .PERIOD 
i've also set up a project in kenya ,COMMA and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps .PERIOD 
my partner ,COMMA m ,COMMA who's a tech guru ,COMMA hacked wordpress .PERIOD 
it costs us ,COMMA like ,COMMA <NUM> dollars a month just for hosting .PERIOD 
everything else on there is a labor of love .PERIOD 
we've manually entered all the data there .PERIOD 
and you can get profiles of each mp ,COMMA questions they've asked in parliament .PERIOD 
we have a comment function ,COMMA where people can ask their mps questions .PERIOD 
there are some mps who participate ,COMMA and come back and ask .PERIOD 
and basically ,COMMA we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA i believe that accountability stems from demand .PERIOD 
you're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart .PERIOD 
and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA they're not going to change just out of nowhere .PERIOD 
so we need new policies ,COMMA we need -- where's that coming from ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society .PERIOD 
we talk about african governments like they've been dropped from mars ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
they come from us .PERIOD 
and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like ?QUESTIONMARK 
and how can we change that ?QUESTIONMARK 
so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable .PERIOD 
where do we go from here ?QUESTIONMARK 
i believe in the power of ideas .PERIOD 
i believe in the power of sharing knowledge .PERIOD 
and i'd ask all of you ,COMMA when you leave here ,COMMA please just share ,COMMA and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going ,COMMA because it can make a difference .PERIOD 
the other thing i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual .PERIOD 
i've had lots of conversations about things i think need to be happening in africa .PERIOD 
people are like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA if you don't do aid ,COMMA i'm a bleeding heart liberal ,COMMA what can i do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and when i talk about my ideas ,COMMA they're like ,COMMA bbut it's not scalable ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
give me something i can do with paypal .PERIOD 
it's not that easy ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual ,COMMA in the fellows you've met ,COMMA and the businesspeople you've met ,COMMA it can make a huge difference ,COMMA especially in africa ,COMMA because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them .PERIOD 
i was helping her pay her tuition .PERIOD 
my cousin ran out of school fees ,COMMA and she's really smart .PERIOD 
i was paying her school fees .PERIOD 
a cousin of mine died of aids ,COMMA left an orphan ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are we going to do with her ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA she's now my baby sister .PERIOD 
and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me ,COMMA i am able to lift all those people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA don't underestimate that .PERIOD 
he's a professor .PERIOD he's now at vanderbilt .PERIOD 
he's an undergrad professor ,COMMA mitchell seligson .PERIOD 
and because of him ,COMMA i got into harvard law school ,COMMA because he took an interest .PERIOD 
i was taking a class of his ,COMMA and he was just like ,COMMA this is an overeager student ,COMMA which we don't normally get in the united states ,COMMA because everyone else is cynical and jaded .PERIOD 
he called me to his office and said ,COMMA what do you want to do when you grow up ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he was like ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA we don't need another lawyer in the united states .PERIOD 
and he tried to talk me out of it ,COMMA but it was like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA i know nothing about applying to law school ,COMMA i'm poli-sci phd .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA let's figure out what i need you to do ,COMMA what i need to do to help you out .PERIOD 
it was like ,COMMA where do you want to go ?QUESTIONMARK 
and to me at that time university -- i was at university of pitts for undergrad ,COMMA and that was like heaven ,COMMA ok ,COMMA because compared to what could have been in kenya .PERIOD 
so i'm like ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i'm just applying to pitt for law school .PERIOD 
he was like ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK you know ,COMMA you're smart ,COMMA you have all these things going for you .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA that's the dumbest reason i've ever heard for applying to law school .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so he took me under his wing ,COMMA and he encouraged me .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA look ,COMMA you can get into harvard ,COMMA you're that good ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if they don't admit you ,COMMA they're the ones who are messed up .PERIOD 
and he built me up ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
and this is just an illustration .PERIOD 
you can meet other individuals here .PERIOD 
we just need a push .PERIOD 
that's all i needed was a push to go to the next level .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA i want to end with my vision for africa ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA my vision is that my daughter ,COMMA and any other african child being born today ,COMMA can be whoever they want to be here ,COMMA without having to leave .PERIOD 
and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born .PERIOD 
that's one thing you americans take for granted ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
that you can grow up ,COMMA you know ,COMMA not so good circumstances ,COMMA and you can move .PERIOD 
just because you are born in rural arkansas ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA that doesn't define who you are .PERIOD 
for most africans today ,COMMA where you live ,COMMA or where you were born ,COMMA and the circumstances under which you were born ,COMMA determine the rest of your life .PERIOD 
i would like to see that change ,COMMA and the change starts with us .PERIOD 
and as africans ,COMMA we need to take responsibility for our continent .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i like to build stuff .PERIOD 
i've always liked to build stuff .PERIOD 
my team at biosense ,COMMA a startup i co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends ,COMMA has built a technology called touchb ,COMMA which can do blood testing of hemoglobin without pricks ,COMMA without needles .PERIOD 
i believe this is going to democratize health care .PERIOD 
they're two big words ,COMMA i don't know what they mean .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA i was even more clueless .PERIOD 
i had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next .PERIOD 
i was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA busy trying to finish off my phd ,COMMA which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact ,COMMA contributors interact ,COMMA how articles are formed in wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system .PERIOD 
i was lucky enough that i visited mumbai ,COMMA my house ,COMMA back for a vacation .PERIOD 
so at that time i was planning a road trip .PERIOD 
i visited a place called parol about two hours north of mumbai .PERIOD 
he's a doctor there .PERIOD 
so abhishek actually made me wait .PERIOD 
he was out there in parol delivering a baby .PERIOD 
i was waiting ,COMMA and when he did emerge ,COMMA he was ashen-faced .PERIOD 
he told me that there had been two deaths ;SEMICOLON the mother and child both had died .PERIOD 
the reason ,COMMA he told me ,COMMA was something called post partum hemorrhage .PERIOD 
he explained this meant severe internal bleeding .PERIOD 
what was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia .PERIOD 
now anemia -- i'm an engineer ,COMMA but even i knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal .PERIOD 
it is something which probably the cure is known .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA folic acid ,COMMA iron tablets -- very cheap ,COMMA affordable cures exist to control anemia .PERIOD 
so why was this woman dying ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was completely preventable .PERIOD 
five minutes away from there ,COMMA i had the center ,COMMA the medical center ,COMMA which was distributing subsidized iron tablets .PERIOD 
so the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me .PERIOD 
and i knew that there had to be a way to prevent this .PERIOD 
my mom is a pediatrician ,COMMA and i asked her .PERIOD 
take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a coulter counter .PERIOD 
this is a $10000 machine which was available in mumbai .PERIOD 
it's also available here or in any part ,COMMA i guess ,COMMA in europe and most cities in the world .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA that woman who was operating the machine ,COMMA the technician ,COMMA is not available in parol .PERIOD 
now this struck me as -- i love to fix things .PERIOD i wanted to fix this .PERIOD 
i got a friend of mine ,COMMA an engineer ,COMMA and three other doctors -- abhishek joined the team -- and we wanted to solve this problem .PERIOD 
by the time i step down from here there will be <NUM> people who have lost their lives through a completely ,COMMA completely preventable problem .PERIOD 
now let me take you back to parol .PERIOD 
you saw the woman there ,COMMA the nurse .PERIOD 
in india this is called an asha worker .PERIOD 
it's essentially a village health worker ,COMMA a matron .PERIOD 
she is really the center of the health care system .PERIOD 
public health care runs on the asha worker ,COMMA not the doctor .PERIOD 
now we knew we had to design something which she could use .PERIOD 
we knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have .PERIOD 
we knew it had to be something which had no needles ,COMMA no pricking ,COMMA so it would have adoption ,COMMA it would not have medical waste ,COMMA all those problems .PERIOD 
it had to be simple enough for that woman asha worker to use .PERIOD 
and thirdly ,COMMA it had to be something which she could carry in her kit .PERIOD 
she goes village to village doing screenings .PERIOD 
we thought we could build it ,COMMA so we built it .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA but it didn't work .PERIOD 
so we built it again .PERIOD 
and we did this <NUM> times .PERIOD 
but i'm very excited to tell you that last year we did build it -- it works .PERIOD 
and i have it here in my purse .PERIOD 
so this is a machine called the touchb quik .PERIOD 
what it does is it measures my hemoglobin ,COMMA oxygen and pulse rate .PERIOD 
i put it on my finger ,COMMA switch it on ,COMMA and in about <NUM> seconds it'll give me ,COMMA on the little screen here ,COMMA a value of hemoglobin ,COMMA oxygen saturation and heart rate .PERIOD 
this will help asha workers diagnose anemia at the point of care .PERIOD 
i'll explain a little bit about how it works .PERIOD 
you might have seen a little light inside of it .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there are three lights in there ,COMMA three wavelengths of light .PERIOD 
and we essentially pass light right through the tissue ,COMMA and from understanding how much of it is transmitted ,COMMA how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed ,COMMA we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood .PERIOD 
and this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography .PERIOD 
we are actually really very excited about what else non-invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future .PERIOD 
one of the things which my intern here ,COMMA pratesh ,COMMA built is a mobile application ,COMMA which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .PERIOD 
there's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing .PERIOD 
i would love to tell you a little bit more about it .PERIOD 
it's the death rates caused by anemia globally .PERIOD 
you'll notice ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that there are hot spots -- south asia ,COMMA africa .PERIOD 
my business plan is very simple .PERIOD 
i'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .PERIOD 
that's a simple bottom-line business plan .PERIOD 
and by the time i'm done ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA when the who publishes the data again ,COMMA this is going to be the map of anemia .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i'm going to tell you a little bit about my tedxhouston talk .PERIOD 
i woke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life .PERIOD 
and i actually didn't leave my house for about three days .PERIOD 
the first time i left was to meet a friend for lunch .PERIOD 
and i sat down ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA god ,COMMA you look like hell .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD i feel really -- i'm not functioning .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA what's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i said ,COMMA i just told <NUM> people that i became a researcher to avoid vulnerability .PERIOD 
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data ,COMMA as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living ,COMMA i told these <NUM> people that i had a breakdown .PERIOD 
i had a slide that said breakdown .PERIOD 
at what point did i think that was a good idea ?QUESTIONMARK 
it was not really you .PERIOD 
it was a little different than what you usually do .PERIOD 
but it was great .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA this can't happen .PERIOD 
youtube ,COMMA they're putting this thing on youtube .PERIOD 
and we're going to be talking about <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i think it's too late .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA let me ask you something .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine ?QUESTIONMARK 
then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape ?QUESTIONMARK 
and she goes ,COMMA uh . .PERIOD no .PERIOD 
that . .PERIOD me neither .PERIOD 
and i'm thinking to myself ,COMMA brene ,COMMA what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK what are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
your sisters would be perfect for this .PERIOD 
so i looked back up and she said ,COMMA are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on youtube ?QUESTIONMARK 
she said ,COMMA you're like the worst vulnerability role model ever .PERIOD 
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic ,COMMA but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .PERIOD 
i said ,COMMA if <NUM> turns into <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA my life is over .PERIOD 
i had no contingency plan for four million .PERIOD 
and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i learned something hard about myself ,COMMA and that was that ,COMMA as much as i would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world ,COMMA there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small ,COMMA staying right under the radar .PERIOD 
but i want to talk about what i've learned .PERIOD 
there's two things that i've learned in the last year .PERIOD 
and that myth is profoundly dangerous .PERIOD 
let me ask you honestly -- and i'll give you this warning ,COMMA i'm trained as a therapist ,COMMA so i can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly ,COMMA when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable ,COMMA think ,COMMA god ,COMMA vulnerability's weakness .PERIOD this is weakness ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?QUESTIONMARK 
now let me ask you this question :COLON this past week at ted ,COMMA how many of you ,COMMA when you saw vulnerability up here ,COMMA thought it was pure courage ?QUESTIONMARK 
vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD 
it fuels our daily lives .PERIOD 
and i've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable ,COMMA to let ourselves be seen ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD 
one of the weird things that's happened is ,COMMA after the ted explosion ,COMMA i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune <NUM> companies .PERIOD 
and so many of the calls went like this ,COMMA hey ,COMMA dr .PERIOD brown .PERIOD we loved your tedtalk .PERIOD 
we'd like you to come in and speak .PERIOD 
we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame .PERIOD 
what would you like for me to talk about ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's three big answers .PERIOD 
this is mostly ,COMMA to be honest with you ,COMMA from the business sector :COLON innovation ,COMMA creativity and change .PERIOD 
so let me go on the record and say ,COMMA vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation ,COMMA creativity and change .PERIOD 
to create is to make something that has never existed before .PERIOD 
there's nothing more vulnerable than that .PERIOD 
adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .PERIOD 
the second thing ,COMMA in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage ,COMMA the second thing i learned is this :COLON we have to talk about shame .PERIOD 
and i'm going to be really honest with you .PERIOD 
when i became a vulnerability researcher and that became the focus because of the tedtalk -- and i'm not kidding .PERIOD 
i'll give you an example .PERIOD 
about three months ago ,COMMA i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store .PERIOD 
about from a hundred feet away ,COMMA this is what i hear :COLON vulnerability ted !EXCLAMATIONMARK vulnerability ted !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i'm a fifth generation texan .PERIOD 
our family motto is lock and load .PERIOD 
so i'm like ,COMMA just keep walking ,COMMA she's on my six .PERIOD 
and then i hear ,COMMA vulnerability ted !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
i turn around ,COMMA i go ,COMMA hi .PERIOD 
she's right here and she said ,COMMA you're the shame researcher who had the breakdown .PERIOD 
at this point parents are ,COMMA like ,COMMA pulling their children close .PERIOD 
look away .PERIOD 
and i'm so worn out at this point in my life ,COMMA i look at her and i actually say ,COMMA it was a frickin' spiritual awakening .PERIOD 
and she looks back and does this ,COMMA i know .PERIOD 
and she said ,COMMA we watched your tedtalk in my book club .PERIOD 
then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'the breakdown babes' and she said ,COMMA our tagline is :COLON 'we're falling apart and it feels fantastic' you can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA thank god ,COMMA because shame is this horrible topic ,COMMA no one wants to talk about it .PERIOD 
it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane .PERIOD 
what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK i study shame .PERIOD oh .PERIOD 
and i see you .PERIOD 
and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability .PERIOD 
i learned about these things from studying shame .PERIOD 
and so i want to walk you in to shame .PERIOD 
jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul .PERIOD 
and we're going to walk in .PERIOD 
and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .PERIOD 
we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country ,COMMA and i think globally ,COMMA around race ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
yes ?QUESTIONMARK we heard that .PERIOD 
yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
cannot have that conversation without shame ,COMMA because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege .PERIOD 
and when people start talking about privilege ,COMMA they get paralyzed by shame .PERIOD 
we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery ,COMMA which is have a checklist .PERIOD 
you can't fix that problem without addressing shame ,COMMA because when they teach those folks how to suture ,COMMA they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful .PERIOD 
and all-powerful folks don't need checklists .PERIOD 
and i had to write down the name of this ted fellow so i didn't mess it up here .PERIOD 
myshkin ingawale ,COMMA i hope i did right by you .PERIOD 
i saw the ted fellows my first day here .PERIOD 
and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA i saw this need .PERIOD 
so you know what i did ?QUESTIONMARK i made it .PERIOD 
and everybody just burst into applause ,COMMA and they were like yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA and it didn't work .PERIOD 
and then i made it <NUM> more times ,COMMA and then it worked .PERIOD 
you know what the big secret about ted is ?QUESTIONMARK 
i guess i'm doing it right now .PERIOD 
this is like the failure conference .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA it is .PERIOD 
you know why this place is amazing ?QUESTIONMARK 
because very few people here are afraid to fail .PERIOD 
and no one who gets on the stage ,COMMA so far that i've seen ,COMMA has not failed .PERIOD 
i've failed miserably ,COMMA many times .PERIOD 
i don't think the world understands that because of shame .PERIOD 
there's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt .PERIOD 
a lot of people refer to it as the man in the arena quote .PERIOD 
and it goes like this :COLON it is not the critic who counts .PERIOD 
it is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles .PERIOD 
but when he's in the arena ,COMMA at best he wins ,COMMA and at worst he loses ,COMMA but when he fails ,COMMA when he loses ,COMMA he does so daring greatly .PERIOD 
and that's what this conference ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is about .PERIOD 
when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door ,COMMA and you think ,COMMA i'm going in and i'm going to try this ,COMMA shame is the gremlin who says ,COMMA uh ,COMMA uh .PERIOD 
you're not good enough .PERIOD 
you never finished that mba .PERIOD your wife left you .PERIOD 
i know your dad really wasn't in luxembourg ,COMMA he was in sing sing .PERIOD 
i know those things that happened to you growing up .PERIOD 
i know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough .PERIOD 
shame is that thing .PERIOD 
and if we can quiet it down and walk in and say ,COMMA i'm going to do this ,COMMA we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the time is who ?QUESTIONMARK 
us .PERIOD 
the thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt .PERIOD 
shame is a focus on self ,COMMA guilt is a focus on behavior .PERIOD 
shame is i am bad .PERIOD 
guilt is i did something bad .PERIOD 
how many of you ,COMMA if you did something that was hurtful to me ,COMMA would be willing to say ,COMMA i'm sorry .PERIOD i made a mistake ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many of you would be willing to say that ?QUESTIONMARK 
guilt :COLON i'm sorry .PERIOD i made a mistake .PERIOD 
shame :COLON i'm sorry .PERIOD i am a mistake .PERIOD 
there's a huge difference between shame and guilt .PERIOD 
and here's what you need to know .PERIOD 
shame is highly ,COMMA highly correlated with addiction ,COMMA depression ,COMMA violence ,COMMA aggression ,COMMA bullying ,COMMA suicide ,COMMA eating disorders .PERIOD 
and here's what you even need to know more .PERIOD 
guilt ,COMMA inversely correlated with those things .PERIOD 
the ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive .PERIOD 
the other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender .PERIOD 
if shame washes over me and washes over chris ,COMMA it's going to feel the same .PERIOD 
everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .PERIOD 
we're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy .PERIOD 
which means ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i have a little shame ;SEMICOLON no ,COMMA i'm a sociopath .PERIOD 
so i would opt for ,COMMA yes ,COMMA you have a little shame .PERIOD 
shame feels the same for men and women ,COMMA but it's organized by gender .PERIOD 
for women ,COMMA the best example i can give you is enjoli the commercial :COLON i can put the wash on the line ,COMMA pack the lunches ,COMMA hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine .PERIOD 
i can bring home the bacon ,COMMA fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man .PERIOD 
for women ,COMMA shame is do it all ,COMMA do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat .PERIOD 
i don't know how much perfume that commercial sold ,COMMA but i guarantee you ,COMMA it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds .PERIOD 
shame ,COMMA for women ,COMMA is this web of unobtainable ,COMMA conflicting ,COMMA competing expectations about who we're supposed to be .PERIOD 
and it's a straight-jacket .PERIOD 
for men ,COMMA shame is not a bunch of competing ,COMMA conflicting expectations .PERIOD 
shame is one ,COMMA do not be perceived as what ?QUESTIONMARK 
weak .PERIOD 
and it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing ,COMMA said ,COMMA i love what you have to say about shame ,COMMA i'm curious why you didn't mention men .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA i don't study men .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK 
and he said ,COMMA because you say to reach out ,COMMA tell our story ,COMMA be vulnerable .PERIOD 
but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ?QUESTIONMARK 
i said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
they'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down .PERIOD 
when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us .PERIOD 
and don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads ,COMMA because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else .PERIOD 
and what i learned is this :COLON you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear ,COMMA i'll show you a woman who's done incredible work .PERIOD 
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it ,COMMA she can't do it all anymore ,COMMA and his first response is not ,COMMA i unloaded the dishwasher ,COMMA but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- i'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work .PERIOD 
shame is an epidemic in our culture .PERIOD 
and to get out from underneath it ,COMMA to find our way back to each other ,COMMA we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting ,COMMA the way we're working ,COMMA the way we're looking at each other .PERIOD 
very quickly ,COMMA some research by mahalik at boston college .PERIOD 
he asked ,COMMA what do women need to do to conform to female norms ?QUESTIONMARK 
the top answers in this country :COLON nice ,COMMA thin ,COMMA modest and use all available resources for appearance .PERIOD 
when he asked about men ,COMMA what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms ,COMMA the answers were :COLON always show emotional control ,COMMA work is first ,COMMA pursue status and violence .PERIOD 
if we're going to find our way back to each other ,COMMA we have to understand and know empathy ,COMMA because empathy's the antidote to shame .PERIOD 
the two most powerful words when we're in struggle :COLON me too .PERIOD 
and so i'll leave you with this thought .PERIOD 
if we're going to find our way back to each other ,COMMA vulnerability is going to be that path .PERIOD 
and that is seductive .PERIOD 
but the truth is that never happens .PERIOD 
and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there ,COMMA that's not what we want to see .PERIOD 
we want to be with you and across from you .PERIOD 
and we just want ,COMMA for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with ,COMMA to dare greatly .PERIOD 
so thank you all very much .PERIOD i really appreciate it .PERIOD 
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .PERIOD 
birds are very agile .PERIOD 
they fly ,COMMA not with rotating components ,COMMA so they fly only by flapping their wings .PERIOD 
so we looked at the birds ,COMMA and we tried to make a model that is powerful ,COMMA ultralight ,COMMA and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings .PERIOD 
so we bring a team together .PERIOD 
there are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders .PERIOD 
and the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads .PERIOD 
so be careful later on .PERIOD 
and this was one issue :COLON to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down .PERIOD 
so why do we do all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
we are a company in the field of automation ,COMMA and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient ,COMMA and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena .PERIOD 
so i now would like you to [put] your seat belts on and put your hats [on] .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
so we can now look at the smartbird .PERIOD 
so here is one without a skin .PERIOD 
we have a wingspan of about two meters .PERIOD 
the length is one meter and six ,COMMA and the weight ,COMMA it is only <NUM> grams .PERIOD 
and it is all out of carbon fiber .PERIOD 
in the middle we have a motor ,COMMA and we also have a gear in it ,COMMA and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor .PERIOD 
so within the motor ,COMMA we have three hall sensors ,COMMA so we know exactly where the wing is .PERIOD 
and if we now beat up and down . .PERIOD 
we have the possibility to fly like a bird .PERIOD 
so if you go down ,COMMA you have the large area of propulsion ,COMMA and if you go up ,COMMA the wings are not that large ,COMMA and it is easier to get up .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the next thing we did ,COMMA or the challenges we did ,COMMA was to coordinate this movement .PERIOD 
we have a split wing .PERIOD 
with a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing ,COMMA and we get the propulsion at the lower wing .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency .PERIOD 
we had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency .PERIOD 
so therefore ,COMMA it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion ,COMMA from <NUM> percent up to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
next thing we have to do ,COMMA we have to control and regulate the whole structure .PERIOD 
only if you control and regulate it ,COMMA you will get that aerodynamic efficiency .PERIOD 
so the overall consumption of energy is about <NUM> watts at takeoff and <NUM> to <NUM> watts in flight .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
markus fischer :COLON yeah ,COMMA sure .PERIOD 
good morning .PERIOD 
i've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering .PERIOD 
it really is a story of dr .PERIOD venkataswamy .PERIOD 
his mission and his message is about the aravind eye care system .PERIOD 
woman :COLON everywhere i went looking for work ,COMMA they said no ,COMMA what use do we have for a blind woman ?QUESTIONMARK 
i couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair .PERIOD 
if an ant fell into my rice ,COMMA i couldn't see that either .PERIOD 
thulasiraj ravilla :COLON becoming blind is a big part of it ,COMMA but i think it also deprives the person of their livelihood ,COMMA their dignity ,COMMA their independence ,COMMA and their status in the family .PERIOD 
so she is just one amongst the millions who are blind .PERIOD 
and the irony is that they don't need to be .PERIOD 
a simple ,COMMA well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions ,COMMA and something even simpler ,COMMA a pair of glasses ,COMMA can make millions more see .PERIOD 
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses ,COMMA then almost one in five indians will require eye care ,COMMA a staggering <NUM> million people .PERIOD 
so this is the context in which aravind came into existence about <NUM> years back as a post-retirement project of dr .PERIOD v .PERIOD 
he started this with no money .PERIOD 
and over time ,COMMA we have grown into a network of five hospitals ,COMMA predominately in the state of tamil nadu and puducherry ,COMMA and then we added several ,COMMA what we call vision centers as a hub-and-spoke model .PERIOD 
and then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well .PERIOD 
the last three decades ,COMMA we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries ,COMMA a vast majority of them for the poor people .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA each year we perform about <NUM> surgeries .PERIOD 
a typical day at aravind ,COMMA we would do about a thousand surgeries ,COMMA maybe see about <NUM> patients ,COMMA send out teams into the villages to examine ,COMMA bring back patients ,COMMA lots of telemedicine consultations ,COMMA and ,COMMA on top of that ,COMMA do a lot of training ,COMMA both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of aravind .PERIOD 
and then doing this day-in and day-out ,COMMA and doing it well ,COMMA requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work .PERIOD 
and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr .PERIOD v ,COMMA a value system ,COMMA an efficient delivery process ,COMMA and fostering the culture of innovation .PERIOD 
dr .PERIOD v :COLON i used to sit with the ordinary village man because i am from a village ,COMMA and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being ,COMMA you seem to be one with him .PERIOD 
here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence .PERIOD 
doctor ,COMMA whatever you say ,COMMA i accept it .PERIOD 
an implicit faith in you and then you respond to it .PERIOD 
here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me ,COMMA i must do my best for her .PERIOD 
when we grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify ourselves with all that is in the world ,COMMA so there is no exploitation .PERIOD 
it is ourselves we are helping .PERIOD 
but on a practical level ,COMMA you also have to deliver services efficiently ,COMMA and ,COMMA odd as it may seem ,COMMA the inspiration came from mcdonald's .PERIOD 
dr .PERIOD v :COLON see ,COMMA mcdonald's' concept is simple .PERIOD 
they feel they can train people all over the world ,COMMA irrespective of different religions ,COMMA cultures ,COMMA all those things ,COMMA to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places .PERIOD 
larry brilliant :COLON he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers ,COMMA and none of it made any sense to us .PERIOD 
he wanted to create a franchise ,COMMA a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of mcdonald's .PERIOD 
dr .PERIOD v :COLON supposing i'm able to produce eye care ,COMMA techniques ,COMMA methods ,COMMA all in the same way ,COMMA and make it available in every corner of the world .PERIOD 
the problem of blindness is gone .PERIOD 
if you think about it ,COMMA i think the eyeball is the same ,COMMA as american or african ,COMMA the problem is the same ,COMMA the treatment is the same .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA why should there be so much variation in quality and in service ,COMMA and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the challenge was that it's a huge problem ,COMMA we are talking of millions of people ,COMMA very little resource to deal with it ,COMMA and then lots of logistics and affordability issues .PERIOD 
and then so ,COMMA one had to constantly innovate .PERIOD 
and one of the early innovations ,COMMA which still continues ,COMMA is to create ownership in the community to the problem ,COMMA and then engage with them as a partner ,COMMA and here is one such event .PERIOD 
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves ,COMMA where they find a place ,COMMA organize volunteers ,COMMA and then we'll do our part .PERIOD you know ,COMMA check their vision ,COMMA and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done ,COMMA and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses ,COMMA or check for glaucoma .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA with all these results ,COMMA the doctor makes a final diagnosis ,COMMA and then prescribes a line of treatment ,COMMA and if they need a pair of glasses ,COMMA they are available right there at the camp site ,COMMA usually under a tree .PERIOD 
but they get glasses in the frames of their choice ,COMMA and that's very important because i think glasses ,COMMA in addition to helping people see ,COMMA is also a fashion statement ,COMMA and they're willing to pay for it .PERIOD 
so they get it in about <NUM> minutes and those who require surgery ,COMMA are counseled ,COMMA and then there are buses waiting ,COMMA which will transport them to the base hospital .PERIOD 
and if it was not for this kind of logistics and support ,COMMA many people like this would probably never get services ,COMMA and certainly not when they most need it .PERIOD 
they receive surgery the following day ,COMMA and then they will stay for a day or two ,COMMA and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from ,COMMA and where their families will be waiting to take them back home .PERIOD 
and this happens several thousand times each year .PERIOD 
it may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients ,COMMA very efficient process ,COMMA but we looked at ,COMMA are we solving the problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
we did a study ,COMMA a scientifically designed process ,COMMA and then ,COMMA to our dismay ,COMMA we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need ,COMMA and we're not adequately addressing more ,COMMA bigger problems .PERIOD 
so we had to do something different ,COMMA so we set up what we call primary eye care centers ,COMMA vision centers .PERIOD 
these are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on .PERIOD 
they receive comprehensive eye exams .PERIOD 
we kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera ,COMMA and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor .PERIOD 
the effect of this has been that ,COMMA within the first year ,COMMA we really had a <NUM> percent penetration in the market that it served ,COMMA which is over <NUM> people .PERIOD 
and the second year went up to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it ,COMMA and in this process of using technology ,COMMA make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital .PERIOD 
and how much will they pay for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
we fixed the pricing ,COMMA taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city ,COMMA so they pay about <NUM> rupees ,COMMA and that's good for three consultations .PERIOD 
the other challenge was ,COMMA how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care ?QUESTIONMARK 
we designed a van with a vsat ,COMMA which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed ,COMMA and then as the patient is waiting ,COMMA the report goes back to the patient ,COMMA it gets printed out ,COMMA the patient gets it ,COMMA and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- i mean ,COMMA go see a doctor or come back after six months ,COMMA and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence .PERIOD 
so the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market ,COMMA because it focused on the non-customer ,COMMA and then by reaching the unreached ,COMMA we're able to significantly grow the market .PERIOD 
the other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA as they finish the surgery ,COMMA they just swing the microscope over ,COMMA the tables are placed so that their distance is just right ,COMMA and then we need to do this ,COMMA because ,COMMA by doing this kind of process ,COMMA we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon .PERIOD 
and then to support the surgeon ,COMMA we require a certain workforce .PERIOD 
and then we focused on village girls that we recruited ,COMMA and then they really are the backbone of the organization .PERIOD 
they do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks .PERIOD 
they do one thing at a time .PERIOD they do it extremely well .PERIOD 
with the result we have very high productivity ,COMMA very high quality at very ,COMMA very low cost .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA putting all this together ,COMMA what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else .PERIOD 
this is a very busy table ,COMMA but what this really is conveying is that ,COMMA when it comes to quality ,COMMA we have put in very good quality-assurance systems .PERIOD 
as a result ,COMMA our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the united kingdom ,COMMA and you don't see those kind of numbers very often .PERIOD 
so the final part of the puzzle is ,COMMA how do you make all this work financially ,COMMA especially when the people can't pay for it ?QUESTIONMARK 
so what we did was ,COMMA we gave away a lot of it for free ,COMMA and then those who pay ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA they paid local market rates ,COMMA nothing more ,COMMA and often much less .PERIOD 
and we were helped by the market inefficiency .PERIOD 
i think that has been a big savior ,COMMA even now .PERIOD 
the result has been ,COMMA over the years ,COMMA the expenditure has increased with volumes .PERIOD 
the revenues increase at a higher level ,COMMA giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free .PERIOD 
i think in absolute terms ,COMMA last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars ,COMMA spent about <NUM> million ,COMMA with over a <NUM> percent ebita .PERIOD 
but this really requires going beyond what we do ,COMMA or what we have done ,COMMA if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness .PERIOD 
we created competition for ourselves ,COMMA and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables .PERIOD 
we proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in india ,COMMA many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well .PERIOD 
the impact of this has been that these hospitals ,COMMA in the second year after our consultation ,COMMA are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well .PERIOD 
the other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
there was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels ,COMMA so we set up a manufacturing unit .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA we believe we have about seven percent of the global market ,COMMA and they're used in about 120-odd countries .PERIOD 
to conclude ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA what we do ,COMMA does it have a broader relevance ,COMMA or is it just india or developing countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
so to address this ,COMMA we studied uk versus aravind .PERIOD 
what it shows is that we do roughly about <NUM> percent of the volume of what the uk does ,COMMA near a half-million surgeries as a whole country .PERIOD 
and we do about <NUM> .PERIOD 
and then we train about <NUM> ophthalmologists against the <NUM> trained by them ,COMMA comparable quality ,COMMA both in training and in patient care .PERIOD 
we looked at cost .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i think it is simple to say just because the uk .PERIOD isn't india the difference is happening .PERIOD 
i think there is more to it .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA i think one has to look at other aspects as well .PERIOD 
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity ,COMMA maybe in efficiency ,COMMA in the clinical process ,COMMA or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables ,COMMA or regulations ,COMMA their defensive practice .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the us ,COMMA and maybe obama's ratings can go up again .PERIOD 
another insight ,COMMA which ,COMMA again ,COMMA i want to leave with you ,COMMA in conditions where the problem is very large ,COMMA which cuts across all economic strata ,COMMA where we have a good solution ,COMMA i think the process i described ,COMMA you know ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA quality ,COMMA patient-centered care ,COMMA can give an answer ,COMMA and there are many which fit this paradigm .PERIOD 
you take dentistry ,COMMA hearing aid ,COMMA maternity and so on .PERIOD 
there are many where this paradigm can now play ,COMMA but i think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA how do you create compassion ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA how do you make people own the problem ,COMMA want to do something about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
there are a bit harder issues .PERIOD 
and i'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these .PERIOD 
it is ourselves we are helping .PERIOD 
it is ourselves we are healing .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i am a phd .PERIOD student and that means i have a question :COLON how can we make digital content graspable ?QUESTIONMARK 
because you see ,COMMA on the one hand ,COMMA there is the digital world and no question ,COMMA many things are happening there right now .PERIOD 
and for us humans ,COMMA it's not quite material ,COMMA it's not really there -- it's virtual .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA we humans ,COMMA we live in a physical world .PERIOD 
it's rich ,COMMA it tastes good ,COMMA it feels good ,COMMA it smells good .PERIOD 
that's my question .PERIOD 
if you look at the iphone with its touch and the wii with its bodily activity ,COMMA you can see the tendency ;SEMICOLON it's getting physical .PERIOD 
the question is :COLON what's next ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA i have three options that i would like to show you .PERIOD 
the first one is mass .PERIOD 
as humans ,COMMA we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA could we use that in mobile phones ?QUESTIONMARK 
it is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside ,COMMA which we can move around ,COMMA and you can feel where it's heavy .PERIOD 
we shift the gravitational center of it .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA we can augment digital content with physical mass .PERIOD 
so you move around the content on a display ,COMMA but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device .PERIOD 
another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city .PERIOD 
it can tell you by its weight ,COMMA okay ,COMMA move right .PERIOD walk ahead .PERIOD make a left here .PERIOD 
and the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time ;SEMICOLON you have your eyes free to see the city .PERIOD 
we're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [our] hands .PERIOD 
so if i download an e-book and it has <NUM> pages -- well ,COMMA they could be thin ,COMMA right -- but if it has <NUM> pages ,COMMA i want to feel that harry potter -- it's thick .PERIOD 
so let me show you the shape-changing mobile .PERIOD 
we can play with the shape itself .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA it can be thin in your pocket ,COMMA which we of course want it to be ;SEMICOLON but then if you hold it in your hand ,COMMA it can lean towards you ,COMMA be thick .PERIOD 
it's like tapered to the downside .PERIOD 
if you change the grasp ,COMMA it can adjust to that .PERIOD 
it's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock ,COMMA it stands .PERIOD 
it's fairly simple .PERIOD 
another thing is ,COMMA sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone ,COMMA they are bigger than the phone itself .PERIOD 
so in that case -- like here ,COMMA there's an app that's bigger than the phone's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you ,COMMA okay ,COMMA off the screen right here ,COMMA there is more content .PERIOD 
you can't see it ,COMMA but it's there .PERIOD 
and you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge .PERIOD 
the shape is the second thing .PERIOD 
the third thing operates on a different level .PERIOD 
wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ?QUESTIONMARK 
think of a hamster in the pocket .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i can feel it ,COMMA it's doing all right -- i don't have to check it .PERIOD 
let me show you the living mobile phone .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA once again ,COMMA mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA but this one ,COMMA it has a breath and a heartbeat ,COMMA and it feels very organic .PERIOD 
and you can tell ,COMMA it's relaxed right now .PERIOD 
oh now ,COMMA missed call ,COMMA a new call ,COMMA new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting .PERIOD 
how do we calm it down ?QUESTIONMARK 
you give it a pat behind the ears ,COMMA and everything is all right again .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us .PERIOD 
and i think making it physical is a good way to do that .PERIOD 
what's behind that is a postulation ,COMMA namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ;SEMICOLON rather than that ,COMMA technology ,COMMA a bit more human .PERIOD 
because of what i'm about to say ,COMMA i really should establish my green credentials .PERIOD 
when i was a small boy ,COMMA i took my pledge as an american ,COMMA to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country ,COMMA its air ,COMMA soil and minerals ,COMMA its forests ,COMMA waters and wildlife .PERIOD 
and i've stuck to that .PERIOD 
stanford ,COMMA i majored in ecology and evolution .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA i put out the whole earth catalog .PERIOD was mister natural for a while .PERIOD 
and then worked for the jerry brown administration .PERIOD 
and we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state .PERIOD 
california is basically the equivalent of europe ,COMMA in this .PERIOD 
this year ,COMMA whole earth catalog has a supplement that i'll preview today ,COMMA called whole earth discipline .PERIOD 
by mid-century we'll be about <NUM> percent urban ,COMMA and that's mostly in the developing world ,COMMA where that's happening .PERIOD 
the developing world now has all of the biggest cities ,COMMA and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries ,COMMA and nine times bigger .PERIOD 
it's qualitatively different .PERIOD 
they are the drivers of history ,COMMA as we see by looking at history .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago this is what the world looked like .PERIOD 
well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA the rise of the west ,COMMA dramatic as it was ,COMMA is over .PERIOD 
the aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming :COLON <NUM> million people a week coming to town ,COMMA decade after decade .PERIOD 
what's really going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out .PERIOD 
subsistence farming is drying up basically .PERIOD 
and this is why .PERIOD 
i used to have a very romantic idea about villages ,COMMA and it's because i never lived in one .PERIOD 
because in town -- this is the bustling squatter city of kibera ,COMMA near nairobi -- they see action .PERIOD they see opportunity .PERIOD 
they see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm .PERIOD 
as you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics .PERIOD 
there is plenty going on .PERIOD 
they are poor ,COMMA but they are intensely urban .PERIOD and they are intensely creative .PERIOD 
the aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters ,COMMA all one billion of them ,COMMA are building the urban world ,COMMA which means they're building the world -- personally ,COMMA one by one ,COMMA family by family ,COMMA clan by clan ,COMMA neighborhood by neighborhood .PERIOD 
they start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by .PERIOD 
they even build their own infrastructure .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA steal their own infrastructure ,COMMA at first .PERIOD 
cable tv ,COMMA water ,COMMA the whole gamut ,COMMA all gets stolen .PERIOD 
and then gradually gentrifies .PERIOD 
so in a town like mumbai ,COMMA which is half slums ,COMMA it's <NUM>/6th of the gdp of india .PERIOD 
social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense .PERIOD 
and that's how they work .PERIOD 
there is a lot of people who think about all these poor people ,COMMA oh there's terrible things .PERIOD we've got to fix their housing .PERIOD 
it used to be ,COMMA oh we've got to get them phone service .PERIOD 
now they're showing us how they do their phone service .PERIOD 
famine mostly is a rural event now .PERIOD 
there are things they care about .PERIOD 
and this is where we can help .PERIOD 
and the nations they're in can help .PERIOD 
and they are helping each other solve these issues .PERIOD 
and you go to a nice dense place like this slum in mumbai .PERIOD 
and you can ask ,COMMA okay what's going on there ?QUESTIONMARK 
the answer is ,COMMA everything .PERIOD 
this is better than a mall .PERIOD it's much denser .PERIOD 
it's much more interactive .PERIOD 
and the scale is terrific .PERIOD 
the main event is ,COMMA these are not people crushed by poverty .PERIOD 
these are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can .PERIOD 
they're helping each other do it .PERIOD 
the informal economy ,COMMA it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics :COLON it's not supposed to be there ,COMMA but it's huge .PERIOD 
we don't understand how it works yet ,COMMA but we have to .PERIOD 
furthermore ,COMMA people in the informal economy ,COMMA the gray economy -- as time goes by ,COMMA crime is happening around them .PERIOD and they can join the criminal world ,COMMA or they can join the legitimate world .PERIOD 
we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world ,COMMA because if we don't ,COMMA they will go toward the criminal world .PERIOD 
there's all kinds of activity .PERIOD 
in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself ,COMMA but it performs services for the city at large .PERIOD 
and one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools .PERIOD 
parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA unofficial school .PERIOD 
education is more possible in the cities ,COMMA and that changes the world .PERIOD 
so you see some interesting ,COMMA typical ,COMMA urban things .PERIOD 
so one thing slammed up against another ,COMMA such as in sao paulo here .PERIOD 
that's what cities do .PERIOD that's how they create value ,COMMA is by slamming things together .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA supply right next to demand .PERIOD 
so the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work ,COMMA in the boring ,COMMA rich neighborhood .PERIOD 
proximity is amazing .PERIOD 
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .PERIOD 
connectivity between the city and the country is what's going to keep the country good ,COMMA because the city has interesting ways of doing things .PERIOD 
this is what makes cities -- this is what makes cities so green in the developing world .PERIOD 
because people leave the poverty trap ,COMMA an ecological disaster of subsistence farms ,COMMA and head to town .PERIOD 
and when they're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly .PERIOD 
and those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town .PERIOD 
so if you want to save a village ,COMMA you do it with a good road ,COMMA or with a good cell phone connection ,COMMA and ideally some grid electrical power .PERIOD 
so the event is :COLON we're a city planet .PERIOD that just happened .PERIOD 
more than half .PERIOD 
the numbers are considerable .PERIOD a billion live in the squatter cities now .PERIOD 
another billion is expected .PERIOD 
that's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way .PERIOD 
and that will determine a lot of how we function .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA for us environmentalists ,COMMA maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb .PERIOD 
people get into town .PERIOD 
the immediately have fewer children .PERIOD 
they don't even have to get rich yet .PERIOD just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer ,COMMA higher-quality kids ,COMMA and the birthrate goes down radically .PERIOD 
very interesting side effect here ,COMMA here's a slide from phillip longman .PERIOD 
shows what is happening .PERIOD 
as we have more and more old people ,COMMA like me ,COMMA and fewer and fewer babies .PERIOD 
and they are regionally separated .PERIOD 
what you're getting is a world which is old folks ,COMMA and old cities ,COMMA going around doing things the old way ,COMMA in the north .PERIOD 
where do you think the action is going to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
shift of subject .PERIOD quickly drop by climate .PERIOD 
the climate news ,COMMA i'm sorry to say ,COMMA is going to keep getting worse than we think ,COMMA faster than we think .PERIOD 
here's just a few samples .PERIOD 
from your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades ,COMMA and what goes along with that ,COMMA which is resource wars and chaos wars ,COMMA as we're seeing in darfur .PERIOD 
that's what drought does .PERIOD 
it brings carrying capacity down ,COMMA and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people .PERIOD and then you're in trouble .PERIOD 
shift to the power situation .PERIOD 
baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city ,COMMA or a city planet .PERIOD 
so far there is only three sources of baseload electricity :COLON coal ,COMMA some gas ,COMMA nuclear and hydro .PERIOD 
of those ,COMMA only nuclear and hydro are green .PERIOD 
coal is what is causing the climate problems .PERIOD 
and everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap ,COMMA until governments make it expensive .PERIOD 
wind and solar can't help ,COMMA because so far we don't have a way to store that energy .PERIOD 
so with hydro maxed out ,COMMA coal and lose the climate ,COMMA or nuclear ,COMMA which is the current operating low-carbon source ,COMMA and maybe save the climate .PERIOD 
and if we can eventually get good solar in space ,COMMA that also could help .PERIOD 
because remember ,COMMA this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA between coal and nuclear ,COMMA compare their waste products .PERIOD 
whereas a coal-burning plant ,COMMA a normal one gigawatt coal plant ,COMMA burns <NUM> rail cars of coal a day ,COMMA each car having <NUM> tons .PERIOD 
and it puts <NUM> thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air .PERIOD 
so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms ,COMMA nuclear is about even with solar and wind ,COMMA and ahead of solar -- oh ,COMMA i'm sorry -- with hydro and wind ,COMMA and ahead of solar .PERIOD 
and does nuclear really compete with coal ?QUESTIONMARK 
just ask the coal miners in australia .PERIOD 
that's where you see some of the source ,COMMA not from my fellow environmentalists ,COMMA but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power .PERIOD 
well the good news is that the developing world ,COMMA but frankly ,COMMA the whole world ,COMMA is busy building ,COMMA and starting to build ,COMMA nuclear reactors .PERIOD 
this is good for the atmosphere .PERIOD 
it's good for their prosperity .PERIOD 
i want to point out one interesting thing ,COMMA which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower .PERIOD 
it's supposed to be ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA local solar and wind and cogeneration ,COMMA and good things like that .PERIOD 
but frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on ,COMMA might serve even better .PERIOD 
the russians ,COMMA who started this ,COMMA are building floating reactors ,COMMA for their new passage ,COMMA where the ice is melting ,COMMA north of russia .PERIOD 
and they're selling these floating reactors ,COMMA only <NUM> megawatts ,COMMA to developing countries .PERIOD 
here's the design of an early one from toshiba .PERIOD 
here's an american design from lawrence livermore lab .PERIOD 
here's another american design that came out of los alamos ,COMMA and is now commercial .PERIOD 
almost all of these are not only small ,COMMA they are proliferation-proof .PERIOD 
they're typically buried in the ground .PERIOD 
and the innovation is moving very rapidly .PERIOD 
so i think microreactors is going to be important for the future .PERIOD 
in terms of proliferation ,COMMA nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity .PERIOD 
and that's why <NUM> percent of the electricity in this room ,COMMA <NUM> percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear .PERIOD 
half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from russia ,COMMA soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads .PERIOD 
and so i would like to see the gnep program ,COMMA that was developed in the bush administration ,COMMA go forward aggressively .PERIOD 
and i was glad to see that president obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in prague the other week .PERIOD 
one more subject .PERIOD genetically engineered food crops ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA as a biologist ,COMMA have no reason to be controversial .PERIOD 
my fellow environmentalists ,COMMA on this subject ,COMMA have been irrational ,COMMA anti-scientific ,COMMA and very harmful .PERIOD 
despite their best efforts ,COMMA genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history .PERIOD 
they're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming ,COMMA which leaves the soil in place ,COMMA getting healthier from year to year -- slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
they reduce pesticide use .PERIOD 
and they increase yield ,COMMA which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller ,COMMA and therefore more wild area is freed up .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA this map from <NUM> is out of date because it shows africa still under the thumb of greenpeace ,COMMA and friends of the earth from europe ,COMMA and they're finally getting out from under that .PERIOD 
and biotech is moving rapidly in africa ,COMMA at last .PERIOD 
this is a moral issue .PERIOD 
the nuffield council on bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available .PERIOD 
speaking of imperatives ,COMMA geoengineering is taboo now ,COMMA especially in government circles ,COMMA though i think there was a darpa meeting on it a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA but it will be on your plate -- not this year but pretty soon ,COMMA because some harsh realizations are coming along .PERIOD 
basically the news is going to keep getting more scary .PERIOD 
there will be events ,COMMA like <NUM> people dying of a heat wave ,COMMA which happened a while back .PERIOD 
like cyclones coming up toward bangladesh .PERIOD 
like wars over water ,COMMA such as in the indus .PERIOD 
but there's this little problem with geoengineering :COLON what body is going to decide who gets to engineer ?QUESTIONMARK how much they do ?QUESTIONMARK where they do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
because everybody is downstream ,COMMA downwind of whatever is done .PERIOD 
and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization .PERIOD 
but if we just say ok ,COMMA china ,COMMA you're worried ,COMMA you go ahead .PERIOD 
you geoengineer your way .PERIOD we'll geoengineer our way .PERIOD 
that would be considered an act of war by both nations .PERIOD 
so this is very interesting diplomacy coming along .PERIOD 
i should say ,COMMA it is more practical than people think .PERIOD 
this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo in <NUM> -- cooled the earth by half a degree .PERIOD 
there was so much ice in <NUM> ,COMMA the following year ,COMMA that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the pinatubo cubs .PERIOD 
to put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year .PERIOD 
that's nothing ,COMMA compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy .PERIOD 
just to run by another one :COLON this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds ,COMMA by atomizing seawater ;SEMICOLON that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet .PERIOD 
a nice one ,COMMA because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places ,COMMA is by copying the ancient amazon indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing ,COMMA smoldering ,COMMA plant waste ,COMMA and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it's improving the soil .PERIOD 
so here is where we are .PERIOD 
nobel prize-winning climatologist paul crutzen calls our geological era the anthropocene ,COMMA the human-dominated era .PERIOD we are stuck with its obligations .PERIOD 
in the whole earth catalog ,COMMA my first words were ,COMMA we are as gods ,COMMA and might as well get good at it .PERIOD 
the first words of whole earth discipline are ,COMMA we are as gods ,COMMA and have to get good at it .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i just did something i've never done before .PERIOD 
i spent a week at sea on a research vessel .PERIOD 
now i'm not a scientist ,COMMA but i was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the university of south florida who have been tracking the travels of bp's oil in the gulf of mexico .PERIOD 
this is the boat we were on ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds ,COMMA the turtles ,COMMA the dolphins ,COMMA the glamorous stuff .PERIOD 
they're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff .PERIOD 
and what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton ,COMMA which is very bad news ,COMMA because so much life depends on it .PERIOD 
so contrary to what we heard a few months back about how <NUM> percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it ,COMMA this disaster is still unfolding .PERIOD 
it's still working its way up the food chain .PERIOD 
rachel carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
she pointed out that the control men -- as she called them -- who carpet-bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like ddt ,COMMA were only trying to kill the little stuff ,COMMA the insects ,COMMA not the birds .PERIOD 
but they forgot this :COLON the fact that birds dine on grubs ,COMMA that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with ddt .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA robin eggs failed to hatch ,COMMA songbirds died en masse ,COMMA towns fell silent .PERIOD 
thus the title silent spring .PERIOD 
i've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the gulf of mexico ,COMMA because i'm canadian ,COMMA and i can draw no ancestral ties .PERIOD 
and i think what it is is i don't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster ,COMMA with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world ,COMMA with what it meant to watch the contents of the earth gush forth on live tv ,COMMA <NUM> hours a day ,COMMA for months .PERIOD 
after telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature ,COMMA suddenly we were face-to-face with our weakness ,COMMA with our lack of control ,COMMA as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- top hats ,COMMA top kills and ,COMMA most memorably ,COMMA the junk shot -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world .PERIOD 
but even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness ,COMMA the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up .PERIOD 
if there is one thing bp's watery improv act made clear ,COMMA it is that ,COMMA as a culture ,COMMA we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable ,COMMA and to do so without a back-up plan ,COMMA without an exit strategy .PERIOD 
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .PERIOD 
our leaders barrel into wars ,COMMA telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA it is years of deadly damage control ,COMMA frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies ,COMMA and once again ,COMMA no exit strategy .PERIOD 
our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence ,COMMA convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down .PERIOD 
and when it inevitably does ,COMMA the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case ,COMMA throwing massive amounts of much-needed public money down a very different kind of hole .PERIOD 
we have to figure out why we keep letting this happen ,COMMA because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do ,COMMA or not to do ,COMMA about climate change .PERIOD 
now as you know ,COMMA a great deal of time is spent ,COMMA in this country and around the world ,COMMA inside the climate debate ,COMMA on the question of ,COMMA what if the ipc scientists are all wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
now a far more relevant question -- as mit physicist evelyn fox keller puts it -- is ,COMMA what if those scientists are right ?QUESTIONMARK 
given the stakes ,COMMA the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible ,COMMA we cannot afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty .PERIOD 
better to err on the side of caution .PERIOD 
more overt ,COMMA the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed ,COMMA but rather on the industry that stands to profit .PERIOD 
but climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution ,COMMA but rather on cost-benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our gdp .PERIOD 
so rather than asking ,COMMA as precaution would demand ,COMMA what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe ,COMMA we ask bizarre questions like this :COLON what is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we put this off till <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
or we ask ,COMMA how much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive ?QUESTIONMARK 
can we go with two degrees ,COMMA three degrees ,COMMA or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees celsius ?QUESTIONMARK 
and by the way ,COMMA the assumption that we can safely control the earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat ,COMMA making the planet not too hot ,COMMA not too cold ,COMMA but just right -- sort of goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy ,COMMA and it's not coming from the climate scientists .PERIOD 
it's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science .PERIOD 
the fact is that we simply don't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops .PERIOD 
so once again ,COMMA why do we take these crazy risks with the precious ?QUESTIONMARK 
a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now ,COMMA like greed .PERIOD 
this is a popular explanation ,COMMA and there's lots of truth to it ,COMMA because taking big risks ,COMMA as we all know ,COMMA pays a lot of money .PERIOD 
another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .PERIOD 
and greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home <NUM> times more than a brain surgeon ,COMMA then you need a narrative ,COMMA you need a story that makes that disparity okay .PERIOD 
and you actually don't have a lot of options .PERIOD 
you're either an incredibly good scammer ,COMMA and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you're some kind of boy genius ,COMMA the likes of which the world has never seen .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA tony hayward ,COMMA the former ceo of bp ,COMMA had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan :COLON what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ?QUESTIONMARK 
now this is actually a popular plaque ,COMMA and this is a crowd of overachievers ,COMMA so i'm betting that some of you have this plaque .PERIOD 
don't feel ashamed .PERIOD 
putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a tedtalk ,COMMA but personally ,COMMA i think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of icarus hanging from the wall ,COMMA because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but i want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time .PERIOD 
so we have greed ,COMMA we've got overconfidence/hubris ,COMMA but since we're here at tedwomen ,COMMA let's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness .PERIOD 
now i'm not going to belabor this point ,COMMA but studies do show that ,COMMA as investors ,COMMA women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men ,COMMA precisely because ,COMMA as we've already heard ,COMMA women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do .PERIOD 
so it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least .PERIOD 
the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted ,COMMA chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides .PERIOD 
and this problem -- call it the perils of privilege -- brings us closer ,COMMA i think ,COMMA to the root of our collective recklessness .PERIOD 
because none of us -- at least in the global north -- neither men nor women ,COMMA are fully exempt from this message .PERIOD 
here's what i'm talking about .PERIOD 
whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them ,COMMA our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer ,COMMA the narrative of manifest destiny ,COMMA the narrative of apocalypse and salvation .PERIOD 
and just when you think these stories are fading into history ,COMMA and that we've gotten over them ,COMMA they pop up in the strangest places .PERIOD 
for instance ,COMMA i stumbled across this advertisement outside the women's washroom in the kansas city airport .PERIOD 
it's for motorola's new rugged cell phone ,COMMA and yes ,COMMA it really does say ,COMMA slap mother nature in the face .PERIOD 
and i'm not just showing it to pick on motorola -- that's just a bonus .PERIOD 
i'm showing it because -- they're not a sponsor ,COMMA are they ?QUESTIONMARK -- because ,COMMA in its own way ,COMMA this is a crass version of our founding story .PERIOD 
we slapped mother nature around and won ,COMMA and we always win ,COMMA because dominating nature is our destiny .PERIOD 
but this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature .PERIOD 
there's another one ,COMMA equally important ,COMMA about how that very same mother nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance .PERIOD 
let's hear from tony hayward again .PERIOD 
the amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume .PERIOD 
it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .PERIOD 
because this is our real master-narrative :COLON however much we mess up ,COMMA there will always be more -- more water ,COMMA more land ,COMMA more untapped resources .PERIOD 
a new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one .PERIOD 
in a way ,COMMA that is the story of the settling of the americas ,COMMA the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which europeans escaped .PERIOD 
and it's also the story of modern capitalism ,COMMA because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system ,COMMA one that cannot survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers .PERIOD 
now the problem is that the story was always a lie .PERIOD 
the earth always did have limits .PERIOD 
they were just beyond our sights .PERIOD 
and now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts .PERIOD 
i believe that we know this ,COMMA yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .PERIOD 
not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories ,COMMA but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA verges on camp .PERIOD 
how else to explain the cultural space occupied by sarah palin ?QUESTIONMARK 
now on the one hand ,COMMA exhorting us to drill ,COMMA baby ,COMMA drill ,COMMA because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them ,COMMA and on the other ,COMMA glorying in the wilderness of alaska's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show .PERIOD 
the twin message is as comforting as it is mad .PERIOD 
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .PERIOD 
there are still no limits .PERIOD 
there will always be another frontier .PERIOD 
so stop worrying and keep shopping .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .PERIOD 
in environmental circles ,COMMA we often hear that ,COMMA rather than shifting to renewables ,COMMA we are continuing with business as usual .PERIOD 
this assessment ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA is far too optimistic .PERIOD 
the truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era ,COMMA the era of extreme energy .PERIOD 
so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water ,COMMA including the icy arctic seas ,COMMA where a clean-up may simply be impossible .PERIOD 
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal ,COMMA the likes of which we haven't yet seen .PERIOD 
and most controversially ,COMMA it means the tar sands .PERIOD 
i'm always surprised by how little people outside of canada know about the alberta tar sands ,COMMA which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the united states .PERIOD 
it's worth taking a moment to understand this practice ,COMMA because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else .PERIOD 
so this is where the tar sands live ,COMMA under one of the last magnificent boreal forests .PERIOD 
the oil is not liquid .PERIOD 
you can't just drill a hole and pump it out .PERIOD 
tar sand's oil is solid ,COMMA mixed in with the soil .PERIOD 
so to get at it ,COMMA you first have to get rid of the trees .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .PERIOD 
the process requires a huge amount of water ,COMMA which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds .PERIOD 
that's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates .PERIOD 
i find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth ,COMMA the largest ever built .PERIOD 
that's a person down there by the wheel .PERIOD 
my point is that this is not oil drilling .PERIOD 
it's not even mining .PERIOD 
it is terrestrial skinning .PERIOD 
vast ,COMMA vivid landscapes are being gutted ,COMMA left monochromatic gray .PERIOD 
now i should confess that as [far as] i'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon .PERIOD 
but the truth is that ,COMMA on average ,COMMA turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in canada .PERIOD 
how else to describe this ,COMMA but as a form of mass insanity ?QUESTIONMARK 
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet ,COMMA off the power of sun ,COMMA wind and waves ,COMMA we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest ,COMMA highest-emitting stuff imaginable .PERIOD 
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us ,COMMA to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that ,COMMA like the bp gusher ,COMMA one can only stand to look at it for so long .PERIOD 
as jared diamond and others have shown us ,COMMA this is how civilizations commit suicide ,COMMA by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes .PERIOD 
the problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too .PERIOD 
at the very last minute ,COMMA we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie ,COMMA just like in the rapture .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our secular religion is technology .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you may have noticed more and more headlines like these .PERIOD 
the idea behind this form of geoengineering as it's called ,COMMA is that ,COMMA as the planet heats up ,COMMA we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun's rays back to space ,COMMA thereby cooling the planet .PERIOD 
the wackiest plan -- and i'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and-a-half miles high into the sky ,COMMA suspended by balloons ,COMMA to spew sulfur dioxide .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .PERIOD 
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .PERIOD 
the serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested .PERIOD 
they don't know if they'll work ,COMMA and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .PERIOD 
nevertheless ,COMMA the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles ,COMMA particularly media circles ,COMMA with a relief tinged with euphoria .PERIOD 
a new frontier has been found .PERIOD 
most importantly ,COMMA we don't have to change our lifestyles after all .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA for some people ,COMMA their savior is a guy in a flowing robe .PERIOD 
for other people ,COMMA it's a guy with a garden hose .PERIOD 
we badly need some new stories .PERIOD 
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on ,COMMA that put the precautionary principle into practice ,COMMA even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested ,COMMA blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining .PERIOD 
we need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around .PERIOD 
that this is our only home .PERIOD 
there is no escape hatch .PERIOD 
call it karma ,COMMA call it physics ,COMMA action and reaction ,COMMA call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit .PERIOD

i still surf .PERIOD i sail the world .PERIOD i freedive .PERIOD

forty crucial questions .PERIOD 
for the last three years ,COMMA i was shooting the earth for the movie .PERIOD 
the name of the movie is home -- maison .PERIOD 
it is about the state of the planet .PERIOD 
it's a fantastic story of life on the earth .PERIOD 
i'm very proud to show you the teaser .PERIOD 
these plants ,COMMA several hundred million years old .PERIOD 
and we humans have been walking upright for only <NUM> thousand years .PERIOD 
we've managed to adapt ,COMMA and have conquered the whole planet .PERIOD 
for generations ,COMMA we've been raising our children ,COMMA not unlike millions of other species living beside us .PERIOD 
for the past <NUM> years i've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky .PERIOD 
our life is tied to the well-being of our planet .PERIOD 
we depend on water ,COMMA forests ,COMMA deserts ,COMMA oceans .PERIOD 
fishing ,COMMA breeding ,COMMA farming are still the world's foremost human occupations .PERIOD 
and what binds us together is far greater than what divides us .PERIOD 
we all share the same need for the earth's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves ,COMMA and become better .PERIOD 
and yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart .PERIOD 
today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet .PERIOD 
in less than <NUM> years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind .PERIOD 
half of the world's forests have vanished .PERIOD 
water resources are running low .PERIOD 
intensive farming is depleting soils .PERIOD 
our energy sources are not sustainable .PERIOD 
the climate is changing .PERIOD 
we are endangering ourselves .PERIOD 
we're only trying to improve our lives .PERIOD 
but the wealth gaps are growing wider .PERIOD 
we haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain .PERIOD 
we know that solutions are available today .PERIOD 
we all have the power to change this trend for the better .PERIOD 
so what are we waiting for ?QUESTIONMARK 
yab :COLON luc besson is the producer of the movie .PERIOD 
but it is not a normal movie .PERIOD 
the film is going to be distributed free .PERIOD 
this film has no copyright .PERIOD 
on the five of june ,COMMA the environment day ,COMMA everybody can download the movie on internet .PERIOD 
the film is given for free to the distributor for tv and theater to show it the fifth of june .PERIOD 
it is also available for school ,COMMA cities ,COMMA ngos and you .PERIOD 
we have to believe what we know .PERIOD 
let me tell you something .PERIOD 
it's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late .PERIOD 
we have all a part of the solutions .PERIOD 
to finish ,COMMA i would like to welcome the 4700th baby born since the beginning of this talk .PERIOD 
so i am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem-cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA inspired by jill bolte taylor last year ,COMMA i didn't bring a human brain ,COMMA but i did bring a liter of bone marrow .PERIOD 
and bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients ,COMMA most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA a few years ago ,COMMA i'm doing my transplant fellowship at stanford .PERIOD 
i'm in the operating room .PERIOD we have bob here ,COMMA who is a volunteer donor .PERIOD 
we're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia .PERIOD 
so actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ?QUESTIONMARK 
bob's on the table ,COMMA and we take this sort of small needle ,COMMA you know ,COMMA not too big .PERIOD 
and the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue ,COMMA and kind of punch it into the hard bone ,COMMA into the tuchus -- that's a technical term -- and aspirate about <NUM> mls of bone marrow out ,COMMA each time ,COMMA with a syringe .PERIOD 
and hand it off to the nurse .PERIOD she squirts it into a tin .PERIOD 
hands it back to me .PERIOD and we do that again and again .PERIOD 
about <NUM> times usually .PERIOD 
and by the end of this my arm is sore ,COMMA i've got a callus on my hand ,COMMA let alone bob ,COMMA whose rear end looks something more like this ,COMMA like swiss cheese .PERIOD 
so i'm thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this procedure hasn't changed in about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
and there is probably a better way to do this .PERIOD 
so i thought of a minimally invasive approach ,COMMA and a new device that we call the marrow miner .PERIOD 
this is it .PERIOD 
and the marrow miner ,COMMA the way it works is shown here .PERIOD 
our standard see-through patient .PERIOD 
instead of entering the bone dozens of times ,COMMA we enter just once ,COMMA into the front of the hip or the back of the hip .PERIOD 
and we have a flexible ,COMMA powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip ,COMMA as it moves around .PERIOD 
so it enables you to very rapidly aspirate ,COMMA or suck out ,COMMA rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole .PERIOD 
we can do multiple passes through that same entry .PERIOD 
no robots required .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA so ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA bob can just get one puncture ,COMMA local anesthesia ,COMMA and do this harvest as an outpatient .PERIOD 
so i did a few prototypes .PERIOD i got a small little grant at stanford .PERIOD 
and played around with this a little bit .PERIOD 
and our team members developed this technology .PERIOD 
and eventually we got two large animals ,COMMA and pig studies .PERIOD 
and we found ,COMMA to our surprise ,COMMA that we not only got bone marrow out ,COMMA but we got <NUM> times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner ,COMMA compared to the normal device .PERIOD 
this device was just fda approved in the last year .PERIOD 
here is a live patient .PERIOD you can see it following the flexible curves around .PERIOD 
and we got ,COMMA again ,COMMA about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient .PERIOD 
so why should you care ?QUESTIONMARK bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells .PERIOD 
you all know about embryonic stem cells .PERIOD 
they've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials .PERIOD 
adult stem cells are throughout our body ,COMMA including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow ,COMMA which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over <NUM> years .PERIOD 
the hope is that this gets more stem cells out ,COMMA which translates to better outcomes .PERIOD 
it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live-saving bone marrow donors .PERIOD 
it may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells ,COMMA when you're younger and healthier ,COMMA to use in the future should you need it .PERIOD 
and ultimately -- and here's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors ,COMMA who come together for a reunion each year at stanford .PERIOD 
hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future .PERIOD 
thanks .PERIOD 
ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA i present to you the human genome .PERIOD 
chromosome one ,COMMA top left .PERIOD 
bottom right are the sex chromosomes .PERIOD 
women have two copies of that big x chromosome ;SEMICOLON men have the x and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that small copy of the y .PERIOD 
sorry boys ,COMMA but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different .PERIOD 
so if you zoom in on this genome ,COMMA then what you see ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is this double helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters ,COMMA or we call them bases ,COMMA right :COLON a ,COMMA c ,COMMA g and t .PERIOD 
how many are there in the human genome ?QUESTIONMARK three billion .PERIOD 
is that a big number ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA everybody can throw around big numbers .PERIOD 
but in fact ,COMMA if i were to place one base on each pixel of this <NUM> by <NUM> resolution screen ,COMMA we would need <NUM> screens to take a look at the genome .PERIOD 
so it's really quite big .PERIOD 
and perhaps because of its size ,COMMA a group of people -- all ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA with y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it .PERIOD 
and so <NUM> years ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and about four billion dollars later ,COMMA the genome was sequenced and published .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA the final version was published ,COMMA and they keep working on it .PERIOD 
it costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it .PERIOD 
well folks ,COMMA i'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it .PERIOD 
and then we bring that into software ,COMMA and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is .PERIOD 
and so just to give you a picture of what this looks like ,COMMA the human genome project :COLON <NUM> gigabases ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
one run on one of these machines :COLON <NUM> gigabases in a week .PERIOD 
and that <NUM> is going to change to <NUM> this summer ,COMMA and there's no sign of this pace slowing .PERIOD 
so the price of a base ,COMMA to sequence a base ,COMMA has fallen <NUM> million times .PERIOD 
that's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in <NUM> ,COMMA waiting until <NUM> ,COMMA and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice .PERIOD 
world population ,COMMA pc placements ,COMMA the archive of all the medical literature ,COMMA moore's law ,COMMA the old way of sequencing ,COMMA and here's all the new stuff .PERIOD 
guys ,COMMA this is a log scale ;SEMICOLON you don't typically see lines that go up like that .PERIOD 
so the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like <NUM> to <NUM> human genomes this year .PERIOD 
and we know this based on the machines that are being placed .PERIOD 
this is expected to double ,COMMA triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA there's one lab in particular that represents <NUM> percent of all that capacity .PERIOD 
it's called the beijing genomics institute .PERIOD 
the chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new moon ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
what does this mean for medicine ?QUESTIONMARK 
so a woman is age <NUM> .PERIOD 
she presents with stage <NUM> estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer .PERIOD 
she is treated with surgery ,COMMA chemotherapy and radiation .PERIOD 
she goes home .PERIOD 
two years later ,COMMA she comes back with stage three c ovarian cancer .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA treated again with surgery and chemotherapy .PERIOD 
she comes back three years later at age <NUM> with more ovarian cancer ,COMMA more chemotherapy .PERIOD 
six months later ,COMMA she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia .PERIOD 
she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later .PERIOD 
so first ,COMMA the way in which this woman was treated ,COMMA in as little as <NUM> years ,COMMA will look like bloodletting .PERIOD 
and it's because of people like my colleague ,COMMA rick wilson ,COMMA at the genome institute at washington university ,COMMA who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem .PERIOD 
and then he compared those two genomes in software ,COMMA and what he found ,COMMA among other things ,COMMA was a deletion ,COMMA a 2000-base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called tp53 .PERIOD 
if you have this deleterious mutation in this gene ,COMMA you're <NUM> percent likely to get cancer in your life .PERIOD 
so unfortunately ,COMMA this doesn't help this woman ,COMMA but it does have severe ,COMMA profound if you will ,COMMA implications to her family .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA if they have the same mutation ,COMMA and they get this genetic test ,COMMA and they understand it ,COMMA then they can go and get regular screens ,COMMA and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life .PERIOD 
let me introduce you now to the beery twins ,COMMA diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two .PERIOD 
their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe that the symptoms weren't matching up ,COMMA and through some heroic efforts and a lot of internet searching ,COMMA she was able to convince the medical community that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA they had something else .PERIOD 
what they had was dopa-responsive dystonia .PERIOD 
significant problems remained .PERIOD 
turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery ,COMMA who was lucky enough to be the cio of a company called life technologies .PERIOD 
they're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools .PERIOD 
and what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called spr ,COMMA which is responsible for producing serotonin ,COMMA among other things .PERIOD 
so on top of l-dopa ,COMMA they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug ,COMMA and they're effectively normal now .PERIOD 
guys ,COMMA this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing .PERIOD 
and at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100000 .PERIOD 
today it's $10000 .PERIOD next year it's $1000 .PERIOD 
the year after it's $100 ,COMMA give or take a year .PERIOD 
that's how fast this is moving .PERIOD 
so here's little nick -- likes batman and squirt guns .PERIOD 
and it turns out nick shows up at the children's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim .PERIOD 
and it's not that he's not eating ,COMMA it's that when he eats ,COMMA his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut .PERIOD 
so a hundred surgeries later ,COMMA he looks at his mom and says ,COMMA mom ,COMMA please pray for me .PERIOD i'm in so much pain .PERIOD 
his pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on ,COMMA but he says ,COMMA let's get this kid's genome sequenced .PERIOD 
and what they find is a single-point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death .PERIOD 
so the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction to what's going on to the food essentially ,COMMA and that's a natural reaction ,COMMA which causes some programmed cell death .PERIOD 
but the gene that regulates that down is broken .PERIOD 
and so this informs ,COMMA among other things ,COMMA of course ,COMMA a treatment for bone marrow transplant ,COMMA which he undertakes .PERIOD 
and after nine months of grueling recovery ,COMMA he's now eating steak with a1 sauce .PERIOD 
the prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA it's here .PERIOD 
and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years just because of this one thing .PERIOD 
which is a fantastic story ,COMMA unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production .PERIOD 
so it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn ,COMMA wheat ,COMMA soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought ,COMMA of flood ,COMMA of pests and pesticides .PERIOD 
now look ,COMMA as long as we continue to increase the population ,COMMA we're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods ,COMMA and that's the only position that i'll take today .PERIOD 
unless there's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating ?QUESTIONMARK 
none ,COMMA not one .PERIOD 
this is a typewriter ,COMMA a staple of every desktop for decades .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing .PERIOD 
and then more general versions of word processors came about .PERIOD 
but ultimately ,COMMA it was a disruption on top of a disruption .PERIOD 
it was bob metcalfe inventing the ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything .PERIOD 
and suddenly we had netscape ,COMMA and we had yahoo and we had ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA the entire dotcom bubble .PERIOD 
not to worry though ,COMMA that was quickly rescued by the ipod ,COMMA facebook and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA angry birds .PERIOD 
look ,COMMA this is where we are today .PERIOD 
this is the genomic revolution today .PERIOD this is where we are .PERIOD 
so what i'd like you to consider is :COLON what does it mean when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome ,COMMA but they connect to genomes all across the planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i just recently had to buy life insurance .PERIOD 
and i was required to answer :COLON a .PERIOD i have never had a genetic test ,COMMA b .PERIOD i've had one ,COMMA here you go ,COMMA and c .PERIOD i've had one and i'm not telling .PERIOD 
but what would have happened if i had said c ?QUESTIONMARK 
consumer applications for genomics ,COMMA they will flourish .PERIOD 
do you want to see whether you're genetically compatible with your girlfriend ?QUESTIONMARK sure .PERIOD 
dna sequencing on your iphone ?QUESTIONMARK there's an app for that .PERIOD 
personalized genomic massage anyone ?QUESTIONMARK 
there's already a lab today that tests for allele <NUM> of the avpr1 gene ,COMMA the so-called cheating gene .PERIOD 
so anybody who's here today with your significant other ,COMMA just turn over to them and swab their mouth ,COMMA send it to the lab and you'll know for sure .PERIOD 
do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy ?QUESTIONMARK 
now think of it ,COMMA it's <NUM> and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns ,COMMA but also her personal genome .PERIOD 
and it looks really good .PERIOD 
and then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same .PERIOD 
do you think that's not going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
do you think it would have helped john mccain ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many people in the audience have the last name resnick like me ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hand .PERIOD 
anybody ?QUESTIONMARK nobody .PERIOD 
typically ,COMMA there's one or two .PERIOD 
so my father's father was one of <NUM> resnick brothers .PERIOD 
they all hated each other .PERIOD 
and they all moved to different parts of the planet .PERIOD 
so it's likely that i'm related to every resnick that i ever meet ,COMMA but i don't know .PERIOD 
but imagine if my genome were deidentified ,COMMA sitting in software ,COMMA and a third cousin's genome was also sitting there ,COMMA and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations .PERIOD 
and so imagine one more thing :COLON that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents ,COMMA would you be willing to meet your third cousin ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we both say yes ,COMMA voila !EXCLAMATIONMARK welcome to chromosomally linkedin .PERIOD 
now this is probably a good thing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
you have bigger clan gatherings and so on .PERIOD 
but maybe it's a bad thing as well .PERIOD 
how many fathers in the room ?QUESTIONMARK raise your hands .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child .PERIOD 
look -- these genomes ,COMMA these <NUM> chromosomes ,COMMA they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet .PERIOD 
and like any new technology ,COMMA it's really in humanity's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind ,COMMA or not .PERIOD 
and so i urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
whoa ,COMMA dude .PERIOD check out those killer equations .PERIOD sweet .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA for the next <NUM> minutes i'm going to do the best i can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations .PERIOD 
it turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral .PERIOD 
coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal .PERIOD 
each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps .PERIOD 
these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors .PERIOD 
if we imagine this to be a hyper-intelligent coral ,COMMA we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question .PERIOD 
we can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance ,COMMA or destiny ,COMMA or what ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high ,COMMA he would tell us that our question was completely stupid .PERIOD 
these corals can be quite kind of mean ,COMMA you see ,COMMA and i have surfing scars to prove that .PERIOD 
but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him .PERIOD 
that he was in all these other locations as well ,COMMA but experiencing them as separate individuals .PERIOD 
for a coral ,COMMA branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world .PERIOD 
unlike us ,COMMA a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics .PERIOD 
the mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works .PERIOD 
and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities ,COMMA just like a coral .PERIOD 
it's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around ,COMMA since we only ever get to experience one possibility .PERIOD 
this quantum weirdness was first described by erwin schrödinger and his cat .PERIOD 
the cat likes this version better .PERIOD 
in this setup ,COMMA schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that ,COMMA by the laws of quantum mechanics ,COMMA branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not .PERIOD 
in the branch in which the sample radiates ,COMMA it sets off a trigger that releases poison and schrödinger is dead .PERIOD 
but in the other branch of reality ,COMMA he remains alive .PERIOD 
these realities are experienced separately by each individual .PERIOD 
as far as either can tell ,COMMA the other one doesn't exist .PERIOD 
this seems weird to us ,COMMA because each of us only experiences an individual existence ,COMMA and we don't get to see other branches .PERIOD 
it's as if each of us ,COMMA like schrödinger here ,COMMA are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities .PERIOD 
the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales .PERIOD 
that's quantum mechanics .PERIOD 
but this does not mean everything happens .PERIOD 
the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't .PERIOD 
what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles .PERIOD 
now i'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles ,COMMA what they are and how this balance works .PERIOD 
in this machine ,COMMA a beam of protons and anti-protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision ,COMMA producing a burst of pure energy .PERIOD 
this energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles ,COMMA with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties .PERIOD 
this enormous machine -- the large hadron collider at cern in geneva -- has a circumference of <NUM> miles and ,COMMA when it's operating ,COMMA draws five times as much power as the city of monterey .PERIOD 
we can't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision .PERIOD 
quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized .PERIOD 
but physics does tell us what particles can be produced .PERIOD 
these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton .PERIOD 
any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced ,COMMA and remain invisible to us .PERIOD 
this is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting .PERIOD 
it's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before ,COMMA so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon .PERIOD 
but before talking about what we might see ,COMMA let me describe the particles we already know of .PERIOD 
there's a whole zoo of subatomic particles .PERIOD 
most of us are familiar with electrons .PERIOD 
a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around .PERIOD 
but the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino ,COMMA with no electric charge and a very tiny mass .PERIOD 
in contrast ,COMMA the up-and-down quarks have very large masses ,COMMA and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms .PERIOD 
these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations ,COMMA which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses .PERIOD 
the electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons .PERIOD 
there is also a very weak force called ,COMMA rather unimaginatively ,COMMA the weak force ,COMMA that interacts only with left-handed matter .PERIOD 
the strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge ,COMMA called color charge ,COMMA and come in three different varieties :COLON red ,COMMA green and blue .PERIOD 
you can blame murray gell-mann for these names -- they're his fault .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA there's the force of gravity ,COMMA which interacts with matter via its mass and spin .PERIOD 
these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has .PERIOD 
the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this higgs particle ,COMMA and we're almost certain it will .PERIOD 
but the greatest mystery is what else we might see .PERIOD 
and i'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges ,COMMA there are <NUM> .PERIOD 
that's a lot of particles to keep track of .PERIOD 
but if we plot them out according to their charges ,COMMA some beautiful patterns emerge .PERIOD 
electrons have an electric charge ,COMMA a negative one ,COMMA and quarks have electric charges in thirds .PERIOD 
so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton ,COMMA it has a total electric charge of plus one .PERIOD 
these particles also have anti-particles ,COMMA which have opposite charges .PERIOD 
if we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space ,COMMA the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction .PERIOD 
the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge ,COMMA which make this pattern .PERIOD 
this is called the unified electroweak model ,COMMA and it was put together back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
the reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the higgs particle .PERIOD 
the higgs ,COMMA over here on the left ,COMMA has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern .PERIOD 
it makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass .PERIOD 
since this massive higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram ,COMMA the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space .PERIOD 
so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two-dimensional space .PERIOD 
we can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions .PERIOD 
the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space ,COMMA and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them .PERIOD 
whenever particles interact ,COMMA nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .PERIOD 
if a particle and an anti-particle collide ,COMMA it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions .PERIOD 
at this point ,COMMA anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero .PERIOD 
in further interactions ,COMMA the charges must always balance .PERIOD 
nature always keeps a perfect balance .PERIOD 
so these patterns of charges are not just pretty .PERIOD 
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .PERIOD 
and we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction ,COMMA which has this nice hexagonal symmetry .PERIOD 
in a strong interaction ,COMMA a strong force particle ,COMMA such as this one ,COMMA interacts with a colored quark ,COMMA such as this green one ,COMMA to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one .PERIOD 
and strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies ,COMMA holding the atomic nuclei together .PERIOD 
but these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story .PERIOD 
we can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force .PERIOD 
when we include these ,COMMA each matter particle has two different spin charges ,COMMA spin-up and spin-down .PERIOD 
so they all split ,COMMA and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space .PERIOD 
we can rotate this pattern in six dimensions ,COMMA and see that it's quite pretty .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles .PERIOD 
this is what we know for certain .PERIOD 
some of these particles are at the very limit of what we've been able to reach with experiments .PERIOD 
from this pattern ,COMMA we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales .PERIOD the way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful .PERIOD 
but now i'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don't know yet .PERIOD 
we want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone ,COMMA and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada .PERIOD 
we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe .PERIOD 
and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies .PERIOD 
in order to do this ,COMMA we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions .PERIOD 
when we introduce a new direction ,COMMA we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction ,COMMA and then we can rotate it in with the others .PERIOD 
if we guess wisely ,COMMA we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions .PERIOD 
when we look at this new unified pattern ,COMMA we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing .PERIOD 
this is the way theories of unification work .PERIOD 
a physicist looks for larger ,COMMA more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset .PERIOD 
this unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles ,COMMA which should act a lot like the weak force ,COMMA only weaker .PERIOD 
now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles :COLON the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation .PERIOD 
they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA if we work in eight-dimensional charge space ,COMMA then we can assign unique new charges to each particle .PERIOD 
then we can spin these in eight dimensions ,COMMA and see what the whole pattern looks like .PERIOD 
here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called triality .PERIOD 
this particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics .PERIOD 
it's a pattern of the largest exceptional lie group ,COMMA e8 .PERIOD 
this lie group is a smooth ,COMMA curved shape with <NUM> dimensions .PERIOD 
one small part of this e8 shape can be used to describe the curved space-time of einstein's general relativity ,COMMA explaining gravity .PERIOD 
together with quantum mechanics ,COMMA the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales .PERIOD 
the pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful ,COMMA and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles ,COMMA each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .PERIOD 
as we spin it ,COMMA we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one .PERIOD 
and with a particular rotation ,COMMA we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once .PERIOD 
it's a very beautiful object ,COMMA and as with any unification ,COMMA we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern .PERIOD 
there are <NUM> gaps where new particles should be ,COMMA two of which have been filled by the pati-salam particles .PERIOD 
from their location in this pattern ,COMMA we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the higgs particle ,COMMA but have color charge and interact with the strong force .PERIOD 
filling in these new particles completes this pattern ,COMMA giving us the full e8 .PERIOD 
this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .PERIOD 
it's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .PERIOD 
it's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable .PERIOD 
its characters are triangles ,COMMA circles and other geometrical figures ,COMMA without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ;SEMICOLON without these ,COMMA one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth .PERIOD 
i believe this to be true ,COMMA and i've tried to follow galileo's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles ,COMMA circles and other geometrical figures .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff ,COMMA the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth .PERIOD 
but it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure ,COMMA beautiful geometry .PERIOD 
joined with quantum mechanics ,COMMA this mathematics describes our universe as a growing e8 coral ,COMMA with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern .PERIOD 
and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider ,COMMA we may be able to see whether nature uses this e8 pattern or a different one .PERIOD 
this process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in .PERIOD 
if the lhc finds particles that fit this e8 pattern ,COMMA that will be very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD 
if the lhc finds new particles ,COMMA but they don't fit this pattern -- well ,COMMA that will be very interesting ,COMMA but bad for this e8 theory .PERIOD 
now how bad would that be ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA pretty bad .PERIOD 
but predicting how nature works is a very risky game .PERIOD 
this theory and others like it are long shots .PERIOD 
one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature .PERIOD 
that's what doing theoretical physics is like :COLON there are a lot of wipeouts .PERIOD 
but in science ,COMMA if something isn't working ,COMMA you have to toss it out and try something else .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life .PERIOD 
i've tried the best i can to live a balanced life .PERIOD 
this way ,COMMA even if the physics i work on comes to nothing ,COMMA i still know i've lived a good life .PERIOD 
and i try to live in beautiful places .PERIOD 
for most of the past ten years i've lived on the island of maui ,COMMA a very beautiful place .PERIOD 
now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment .PERIOD 
i'm going to let you in on that secret .PERIOD 
this was a view from my home office on maui .PERIOD 
and this is another ,COMMA and another .PERIOD 
and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar ,COMMA but in slightly different places .PERIOD 
that's because this used to be my home and office on maui .PERIOD 
i've chosen a very unusual life .PERIOD 
but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .PERIOD 
living a nomadic existence has been hard at times ,COMMA but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that i've been happy with .PERIOD 
it allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper-intelligent coral .PERIOD 
but i also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people .PERIOD 
so i'm very happy to have been invited here to ted .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
chris anderson :COLON i probably understood two percent of that ,COMMA but i still absolutely loved it .PERIOD so i'm going to sound dumb .PERIOD 
your theory of everything -- garrett lisi :COLON i'm used to coral .PERIOD 
that's right .PERIOD the reason it's got a few people at least excited is because ,COMMA if you're right ,COMMA it brings gravity and quantum theory together .PERIOD 
so are you saying that we should think of the universe ,COMMA at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are ,COMMA are somehow an e8 object of possibility ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA is there a scale to it ,COMMA at the smallest scale ,COMMA or . ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA right now the pattern i showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape .PERIOD 
and that's the one that i said we knew for certain .PERIOD 
and these patterns of points that i've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience .PERIOD 
and that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see .PERIOD 
but a string theorist ,COMMA as i understand it ,COMMA explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- i know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it .PERIOD 
how should we think of an electron in relation to e8 ?QUESTIONMARK 
no ,COMMA it would be one of the symmetries of this e8 shape .PERIOD 
so what's happening is ,COMMA as the shape is moving over space-time ,COMMA it's twisting .PERIOD and the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see .PERIOD so it would be -- ca :COLON the size of the e8 shape ,COMMA how does that relate to the electron ?QUESTIONMARK 
i kind of feel like i need that for my picture .PERIOD 
is it bigger ?QUESTIONMARK is it smaller ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA as far as we know electrons are point particles ,COMMA so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales .PERIOD 
so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is ,COMMA all possibilities are expanding and developing at once .PERIOD 
and this is why i use the analogy to coral .PERIOD 
and in this way ,COMMA the way that e8 comes in is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in space-time .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are ,COMMA themselves .PERIOD 
so through quantum field theory ,COMMA they manifest themselves as points and interact that way .PERIOD 
i don't know if i'll be able to make this any clearer .PERIOD 
it doesn't really matter .PERIOD 
it's evoking a kind of sense of wonder ,COMMA and i certainly want to understand more of this .PERIOD 
but thank you so much for coming .PERIOD that was absolutely fascinating .PERIOD 
good afternoon ,COMMA good evening ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
we can go ,COMMA jambo ,COMMA guten abend ,COMMA bonsoir ,COMMA but we can also ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh ,COMMA ooh .PERIOD 
that is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening .PERIOD 
you hear it going from one side of the valley to the other ,COMMA from one group of nests to the next .PERIOD 
and i want to pick up with my talk this evening from where zeray left off yesterday .PERIOD 
he was talking about this amazing ,COMMA three-year-old australopithecine child ,COMMA selam .PERIOD 
and we've also been hearing about the history ,COMMA the family tree ,COMMA of mankind through dna genetic profiling .PERIOD 
and it was a paleontologist ,COMMA the late louis leakey ,COMMA who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees .PERIOD 
and it was pretty extraordinary ,COMMA way back then .PERIOD 
it's kind of commonplace now ,COMMA but his argument was -- because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in africa .PERIOD 
and you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils ,COMMA from the shape of the muscle attachments ,COMMA something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them .PERIOD 
but what about how they behaved ?QUESTIONMARK that's what he wanted to know .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA behavior doesn't fossilize .PERIOD 
he argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives ,COMMA the great apes ,COMMA and humans today ,COMMA then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like ,COMMA human-like ancestor some seven million years ago .PERIOD 
and therefore ,COMMA perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient ,COMMA ancient past .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution ,COMMA you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved ,COMMA based on the behavior of chimpanzees .PERIOD 
so it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us ,COMMA in certain aspects of their behavior .PERIOD 
every chimpanzee has his or her own personality .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA i gave them names .PERIOD they can live to be <NUM> years or more ,COMMA although we think most of them probably don't make it to <NUM> in the wild .PERIOD 
mr .PERIOD wurzel .PERIOD the female has her first baby when she's <NUM> or <NUM> .PERIOD 
thereafter ,COMMA she has one baby only every five or six years ,COMMA a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing ,COMMA sleeping with the mother at night ,COMMA and riding on her back .PERIOD 
and we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees ,COMMA just as it is for us ,COMMA in relation to learning .PERIOD 
as the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals ,COMMA so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history .PERIOD 
and young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do .PERIOD 
we know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see .PERIOD 
and we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next ,COMMA through observation ,COMMA imitation and practice ,COMMA so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture .PERIOD 
chimpanzees don't have a spoken language .PERIOD we've talked about that .PERIOD 
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures ,COMMA many of which are similar ,COMMA or even identical ,COMMA to ours and formed in the same context .PERIOD greeting chimpanzees embracing .PERIOD 
they also kiss ,COMMA hold hands ,COMMA pat one another on the back .PERIOD 
and they swagger and they throw rocks .PERIOD 
in chimpanzee society ,COMMA we find many ,COMMA many examples of compassion ,COMMA precursors to love and true altruism .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA they ,COMMA like us ,COMMA have a dark side to their nature .PERIOD 
they're capable of extreme brutality ,COMMA even a kind of primitive war .PERIOD 
and these really aggressive behaviors ,COMMA for the most part ,COMMA are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group .PERIOD 
they are very territorially aggressive .PERIOD 
it's a very blurry line ,COMMA and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations .PERIOD 
the study that i began in <NUM> is still continuing to this day .PERIOD 
and these chimpanzees ,COMMA living their complex social lives in the wild ,COMMA have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of ,COMMA and not separated from ,COMMA the amazing animals with whom we share the planet .PERIOD 
so it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees ,COMMA like so many other creatures around the world ,COMMA are losing their habitats .PERIOD 
this is just one photograph from the air ,COMMA and it shows you the forested highlands of gombe .PERIOD 
and it was when i flew over the whole area ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and realized that outside the park ,COMMA this forest ,COMMA which in <NUM> had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of lake tanganyika ,COMMA which is where the tiny ,COMMA 30-square-mile gombe national park lies ,COMMA that a question came to my mind .PERIOD 
how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees ,COMMA when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive ?QUESTIONMARK 
more people are living there than the land could possibly support .PERIOD 
the numbers increased by refugees pouring in from burundi and over the lake from congo .PERIOD 
and very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere .PERIOD 
this led to a program ,COMMA which we call tacare .PERIOD 
it's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park .PERIOD 
it started small with <NUM> villages .PERIOD it's now in <NUM> .PERIOD 
ways of controlling ,COMMA preventing soil erosion .PERIOD 
working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells .PERIOD 
most important of all ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA is working with small groups of women ,COMMA providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans .PERIOD 
empowering women ,COMMA working with education ,COMMA providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school ,COMMA in the clear understanding that ,COMMA all around the world ,COMMA as women's education improves ,COMMA family size drops .PERIOD 
we provide information about family planning and about hiv/aids .PERIOD 
it was a tanzanian team talking to the villagers ,COMMA asking what they were interested in .PERIOD 
were they interested in conservation ?QUESTIONMARK absolutely not .PERIOD 
they were interested in health ;SEMICOLON they were interested in education .PERIOD 
and as time went on ,COMMA and as their situation began to improve ,COMMA they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation .PERIOD 
they began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees ,COMMA so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA we are developing what we call the greater gombe ecosystem .PERIOD 
this is an area way outside the national park ,COMMA stretching out into all these very degraded lands .PERIOD 
and as these villages have a better standard of life ,COMMA they are actually agreeing to put between <NUM> percent and <NUM> percent of their land in the highlands aside ,COMMA so that once again ,COMMA as the trees grow back ,COMMA the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic viability -- with other remnant groups outside the national park .PERIOD 
so tacare is a success .PERIOD 
we're replicating it in other parts of africa ,COMMA around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure .PERIOD 
the problems in africa ,COMMA however ,COMMA as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of ted ,COMMA are major problems .PERIOD 
there is a great deal of poverty .PERIOD 
and when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile ,COMMA particularly when you cut down trees ,COMMA and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion ,COMMA as desperate populations cut down more and more trees ,COMMA so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families ,COMMA what's going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK something's got to give .PERIOD 
and the other problems -- in not only africa ,COMMA but the rest of the developing world and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA everywhere -- what are we doing to our planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
you know ,COMMA the famous scientist ,COMMA e .PERIOD o .PERIOD wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average european or american ,COMMA we need three new planets .PERIOD 
today ,COMMA they are saying four .PERIOD but we don't have them .PERIOD we've got one .PERIOD 
and what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK i mean ,COMMA the question here is ,COMMA here we are ,COMMA arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet earth ,COMMA with this extraordinary brain ,COMMA capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these ted conferences ,COMMA and yet we're destroying the only home we have .PERIOD 
the indigenous people around the world ,COMMA before they made a major decision ,COMMA used to sit around and ask themselves ,COMMA how does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead ?QUESTIONMARK 
today ,COMMA major decisions -- and i'm not particularly talking about africa here ,COMMA but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars ,COMMA and millions of people ,COMMA are often based on ,COMMA how will this affect the next shareholders' meeting ?QUESTIONMARK 
and these decisions affect africa .PERIOD 
as i began traveling around africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests ,COMMA i realized more and more how so many of africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation .PERIOD 
so i began traveling outside africa ,COMMA talking in europe ,COMMA talking in the united states ,COMMA going to asia .PERIOD 
the air that we breathe that often poisons us .PERIOD 
the earth is poisoning our foods .PERIOD 
the mangroves are being cut down ;SEMICOLON the effects of things like the tsunami get worse .PERIOD 
we've talked about the soil erosion .PERIOD 
we have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses ,COMMA so called ,COMMA leading to climate change .PERIOD 
finally ,COMMA all around the world ,COMMA people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate .PERIOD 
all around the world climates are mixed up .PERIOD 
and it's the poor people who are affected worse .PERIOD 
it's africa that already is affected .PERIOD 
and when the rain does come ,COMMA it so often leads to flooding and added distress ,COMMA and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease .PERIOD 
and the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support ,COMMA who are too poor to buy food ,COMMA who can't move away because the whole land is degraded .PERIOD 
and so you get desertification -- creeping ,COMMA creeping ,COMMA creeping -- as the last of the trees are cut down .PERIOD 
and this kind of thing is not just in africa .PERIOD it's all over the world .PERIOD 
so it wasn't surprising to me that as i was traveling around the world i met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope .PERIOD 
we seem to have lost wisdom ,COMMA the wisdom of the indigenous people .PERIOD 
i asked a question .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK 
and these young people ,COMMA when i talk to them ,COMMA basically they were either depressed or apathetic ,COMMA or bitter and angry .PERIOD and they said more or less the same thing ,COMMA we feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it .PERIOD 
i've got three little grandchildren ,COMMA and every time i look at them and i think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since i was their age ,COMMA i feel this desperation .PERIOD 
and that led to this program we call roots and shoots ,COMMA which began right here in tanzania and has now spread to <NUM> countries around the world .PERIOD 
it's symbolic .PERIOD roots make a firm foundation .PERIOD 
shoots seem tiny ;SEMICOLON to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall .PERIOD 
see the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet ,COMMA environmental and social .PERIOD it's a message of hope .PERIOD 
the most important message of roots and shoots :COLON every single one of us makes a difference ,COMMA every single day .PERIOD 
we have a choice .PERIOD every one of us in this room ,COMMA we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make .PERIOD 
the very poor have no choice .PERIOD it's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well .PERIOD 
the roots and shoots groups all choose three projects .PERIOD 
it depends on how old they are ,COMMA and which country ,COMMA whether they're in a city or rural ,COMMA as to what kinds of projects .PERIOD 
but basically ,COMMA we have programs now from preschool right through university ,COMMA with more and more adults starting their own roots and shoots groups .PERIOD 
and every group chooses ,COMMA between them ,COMMA three different kinds of project to make this a better world ,COMMA recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other .PERIOD 
so one of their projects will be to help their own human community .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA if they're able ,COMMA they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world .PERIOD 
and one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share .PERIOD 
and woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves ,COMMA in our families ,COMMA in our communities ,COMMA between nations ,COMMA between cultures ,COMMA between religions and between us and the natural world .PERIOD 
we need the natural world .PERIOD we cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are .PERIOD 
we not do have more than this one planet .PERIOD 
just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing ,COMMA one or two projects only -- in tanzania ,COMMA in uganda ,COMMA kenya ,COMMA south africa ,COMMA congo-brazzaville ,COMMA sierra leone ,COMMA cameroon and other groups .PERIOD and as i say ,COMMA it's in <NUM> countries around the world .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA they're planting trees .PERIOD they're growing organic vegetables .PERIOD 
they're working in the refugee camps ,COMMA with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money ,COMMA or just using them to feed their families ,COMMA and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment ,COMMA because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens .PERIOD 
it's being used in uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers .PERIOD 
doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves .PERIOD 
once again ,COMMA they're useful members of society .PERIOD 
we have this program in prisons as well .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there's no time for more roots and shoots now .PERIOD 
but -- oh ,COMMA they're also working on hiv/aids .PERIOD 
that's a very important component of roots and shoots ,COMMA with older kids talking to younger ones .PERIOD 
and unwanted pregnancies and things like that ,COMMA which young people listen to better from other youth ,COMMA rather than adults .PERIOD 
hope .PERIOD that's the question i get asked as i'm going around the world :COLON jane ,COMMA you've seen so many terrible things ,COMMA you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million ,COMMA at the turn of the century ,COMMA to no more than <NUM> now ,COMMA and the same with so many other animals .PERIOD 
forests disappearing ,COMMA deserts where once there was forest .PERIOD 
do you really have hope ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA there's hope .PERIOD one is this amazing human brain .PERIOD 
and i've just been so thrilled ,COMMA finally ,COMMA to come to people talking about compost latrines .PERIOD 
it's one of my hobbyhorses .PERIOD 
we just flush all this water down the lavatory ,COMMA it's terrible .PERIOD 
and then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important .PERIOD 
do we care about the planet for our children ?QUESTIONMARK 
do we care about their future ?QUESTIONMARK 
and if we care about their future ,COMMA we ,COMMA as the elite around the world ,COMMA we can do something about it .PERIOD we can make choices as to how we live each day .PERIOD 
what we buy .PERIOD what we wear .PERIOD 
and choose to make these choices with the question ,COMMA how will this affect the environment around me ?QUESTIONMARK 
how will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up ?QUESTIONMARK 
or my grandchild ,COMMA or whatever it is .PERIOD 
so the human brain ,COMMA coupled with the human heart ,COMMA and we join hands around the world .PERIOD 
and that's what ted is helping so well with ,COMMA and google who help us ,COMMA and esri are helping us with mapping in gombe national park .PERIOD 
all of these technologies we can use .PERIOD 
now let's link them ,COMMA and it's beginning to happen ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
you've heard about it this afternoon .PERIOD it's beginning to happen .PERIOD 
this change ,COMMA this change .PERIOD to see change that we must have if we care about the future .PERIOD 
and the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient .PERIOD 
you can take an area that's absolutely destroyed ,COMMA with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate .PERIOD 
and an example is the tacare program .PERIOD 
i told you ,COMMA where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood ,COMMA which you don't need to because you have wood lots ,COMMA then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree .PERIOD 
and animals ,COMMA almost on the brink of extinction ,COMMA can be given a second chance .PERIOD that's my next book .PERIOD 
it's inspiring .PERIOD and it brings me to my last category of hope ,COMMA and we've heard about this so much in the last two days :COLON this indomitable human spirit .PERIOD this determination of people ,COMMA the resilience of the human spirit ,COMMA so that people who you would think would be battered by poverty ,COMMA or disease ,COMMA or whatever ,COMMA can pull themselves up out of it ,COMMA sometimes with a helping hand ,COMMA and take their part in society ,COMMA and take their part in changing the world .PERIOD 
and just to think of one or two people out of africa who are just really inspiring .PERIOD 
we could make a very long list ,COMMA but obviously nelson mandela ,COMMA emerging from <NUM> years of hard physical labor ,COMMA <NUM> years of imprisonment ,COMMA with this amazing ability to forgive ,COMMA so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath .PERIOD 
ken saro-wiwa ,COMMA in nigeria ,COMMA who took on the giant oil companies ,COMMA and although people around the world tried their best ,COMMA was executed .PERIOD 
people like this are the role models we need for young africans .PERIOD 
and we need some environmental role models as well ,COMMA and i've been hearing some of them today .PERIOD 
so i'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again ,COMMA with everyone at ted .PERIOD 
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who's running this entire conference center ,COMMA i met her today .PERIOD 
she came up so excited ,COMMA with her certificate .PERIOD she was [in] roots and shoots .PERIOD 
she was in the leadership in dar es salaam .PERIOD 
she said it's helped her to do what she's doing .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across .PERIOD 
and some of you may argue ,COMMA well ,COMMA don't today's cell phones do that already ?QUESTIONMARK 
but i would say no .PERIOD 
when you meet someone here at ted -- and this is the top networking place ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say ,COMMA can you hold on for a moment while i take out my phone and google you ?QUESTIONMARK 
or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers ,COMMA you don't take out your cell phone ,COMMA and open a browser ,COMMA and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make .PERIOD 
so we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take .PERIOD 
and so my research group at the media lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way ,COMMA without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior .PERIOD 
and i'm here to unveil our latest effort ,COMMA and most successful effort so far ,COMMA which is still very much a work in process .PERIOD 
i'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA only cost <NUM> dollars at this point in time .PERIOD 
i'm wearing a camera ,COMMA just a simple webcam ,COMMA a portable ,COMMA battery-powered projection system with a little mirror .PERIOD 
these components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device .PERIOD 
and in the video here we see my student pranav mistry ,COMMA who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system .PERIOD 
and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him .PERIOD 
the system tracks the four significant fingers .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize .PERIOD 
but if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors .PERIOD 
and the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to ,COMMA for example ,COMMA a map of long beach ,COMMA zoom in and out ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
the system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the take a picture gesture ,COMMA and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you .PERIOD 
and when he then walks back to the media lab ,COMMA he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken ,COMMA sort through them and organize them ,COMMA and re-size them ,COMMA etc ,COMMA again using all natural gestures .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by jeff han or some of you may think ,COMMA well ,COMMA doesn't this look like the microsoft surface table ?QUESTIONMARK 
and yes ,COMMA you also interact using natural gestures ,COMMA both hands ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
but the difference here is that you can use any surface ,COMMA you can walk to up to any surface ,COMMA including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data .PERIOD 
the device is completely portable ,COMMA and can be . .PERIOD 
so one important difference is that it's totally mobile .PERIOD 
another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that i'm wearing around my neck .PERIOD 
so we see pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he's picking up ,COMMA using either image recognition or marker technology ,COMMA and give him the green light or an orange light .PERIOD 
he can ask for additional information .PERIOD 
so this particular choice here is a particularly good choice ,COMMA given his personal criteria .PERIOD 
some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically-responsible choice .PERIOD 
if he picks up a book in the bookstore ,COMMA he can get an amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book .PERIOD 
this is juan's book ,COMMA our previous speaker ,COMMA which gets a great rating ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA at amazon .PERIOD 
and so ,COMMA pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments ,COMMA maybe sort of information by his favorite critic ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
if he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page .PERIOD 
reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated .PERIOD 
this is a more controversial one .PERIOD 
as you interact with someone at ted ,COMMA maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags ,COMMA the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages .PERIOD 
in this case ,COMMA the student is interested in cameras ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
on your way to the airport ,COMMA if you pick up your boarding pass ,COMMA it can tell you that your flight is delayed ,COMMA that the gate has changed ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA if you need to know what the current time is it's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm .PERIOD 
so that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across .PERIOD 
my student pranav ,COMMA who's really ,COMMA like i said ,COMMA the genius behind this .PERIOD 
he does deserve a lot of applause because i don't think he's slept much in the last three months ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either .PERIOD 
but it's not perfect yet ,COMMA it's very much a work in progress .PERIOD 
and who knows ,COMMA maybe in another <NUM> years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
i'm a visual artist ,COMMA and i'm also one of the co-founders of the plastic pollution coalition .PERIOD 
i've been working with plastic bags ,COMMA which i cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
i turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations .PERIOD 
upon working with the plastic ,COMMA after about the first eight years ,COMMA some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA great .PERIOD 
it's ephemeral just like us .PERIOD 
upon educating myself a little further about plastics ,COMMA i actually realized this was a bad thing .PERIOD 
it's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits ,COMMA because it's always still plastic .PERIOD 
and what we're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment .PERIOD 
and my initial reaction -- and i think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is ,COMMA oh my god !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we've got to go out there and clean this thing up .PERIOD 
so i actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers ,COMMA a crane ,COMMA a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine .PERIOD 
and my intention was to go out to the gyre ,COMMA raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic ,COMMA chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities .PERIOD 
i began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so ,COMMA i realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world ,COMMA and that actually i needed to back up and look at the bigger picture .PERIOD 
we need to cut the spigot of single-use and disposable plastics ,COMMA which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale .PERIOD 
so in looking at that ,COMMA i also realized that i was really angry .PERIOD 
i wasn't just concerned about plastic that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the pacific ocean -- of which i have learned there are now <NUM> gyres ,COMMA potentially ,COMMA of plastic in five major oceans in the world .PERIOD 
i'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic .PERIOD 
all of my beverages are packaged in plastic ,COMMA even at the health food market .PERIOD 
i'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator ,COMMA and i'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies .PERIOD 
so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue ,COMMA and we created the plastic pollution coalition .PERIOD 
we have many initiatives that we're working on ,COMMA but some of them are very basic .PERIOD 
one is :COLON if <NUM> to <NUM> percent of what we're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic ,COMMA then why don't we call it what it is .PERIOD 
it's plastic pollution .PERIOD 
recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling .PERIOD 
what is the reality of that ?QUESTIONMARK 
in the united states ,COMMA less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled .PERIOD 
and if you really look into it ,COMMA particularly when it comes to plastic bottles ,COMMA most of it is only down-cycled ,COMMA or incinerated ,COMMA or shipped to china .PERIOD 
it is down-cycled and turned into lesser things ,COMMA while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again .PERIOD 
so this is a big issue for us .PERIOD 
another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about is we've added a fourth r onto the front of the reduce ,COMMA reuse ,COMMA recycle ,COMMA three r's ,COMMA and that is refuse .PERIOD 
whenever possible ,COMMA refuse single-use and disposable plastics .PERIOD 
alternatives exist ;SEMICOLON some of them are very old-school .PERIOD 
i myself am now collecting these cool pyrex containers and using those instead of glad and tupperware containers to store food in .PERIOD 
and i know that i am doing a service to myself and my family .PERIOD 
it's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle or a glass bottle ,COMMA if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water ,COMMA versus purchasing plastic bottled water .PERIOD 
i guess what i want to say to everybody here -- and i know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans ,COMMA but this is a problem that we've created as consumers and we can solve .PERIOD 
we can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives .PERIOD 
so whenever possible ,COMMA to choose alternatives to single-use plastics .PERIOD 
we can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so ,COMMA save our oceans ,COMMA save our planet ,COMMA save ourselves .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
good morning everybody .PERIOD 
i'd like to talk about a couple of things today .PERIOD 
the first thing is water .PERIOD 
now i see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference ,COMMA over the past couple of days .PERIOD 
what if it was from a source like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea .PERIOD 
i talked a lot in the past about statistics ,COMMA and the provision of safe drinking water for all .PERIOD 
but they just don't seem to get through .PERIOD 
and i think i've worked out why .PERIOD 
it's because ,COMMA using current thinking ,COMMA the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving .PERIOD 
so we just switch off :COLON us ,COMMA governments and aid agencies .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA today ,COMMA i'd like to show you that through thinking differently ,COMMA the problem has been solved .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA since i've been speaking ,COMMA another <NUM> people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea .PERIOD 
and four children have just died .PERIOD 
i invented lifesaver bottle because i got angry .PERIOD 
i ,COMMA like most of you ,COMMA was sitting down ,COMMA the day after christmas in <NUM> ,COMMA when i was watching the devastating news of the asian tsunami as it rolled in ,COMMA playing out on tv .PERIOD 
the days and weeks that followed ,COMMA people fleeing to the hills ,COMMA being forced to drink contaminated water or face death .PERIOD 
that really stuck with me .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA a few months later ,COMMA hurricane katrina slammed into the side of america .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA i thought ,COMMA here's a first world country ,COMMA let's see what they can do .PERIOD 
day one :COLON nothing .PERIOD 
day two :COLON nothing .PERIOD 
do you know it took five days to get water to the superdome ?QUESTIONMARK 
people were shooting each other on the streets for tv sets and water .PERIOD 
that's when i decided i had to do something .PERIOD 
now i spent a lot of time in my garage ,COMMA over the next weeks and months ,COMMA and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA after a few failed prototypes ,COMMA i finally came up with this ,COMMA the lifesaver bottle .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA now for the science bit .PERIOD 
before lifesaver ,COMMA the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD 
so a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole .PERIOD 
the smallest virus ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA is about <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD 
so that's definitely going to get through those <NUM> nanometer holes .PERIOD 
lifesaver pores are <NUM> nanometers .PERIOD 
so nothing is getting through .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA i'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration .PERIOD 
would you like to see that ?QUESTIONMARK 
i spent all the time setting this up ,COMMA so i guess i should .PERIOD 
we're in the fine city of oxford .PERIOD 
so -- someone's done that up .PERIOD 
fine city of oxford ,COMMA so what i've done is i've gone and got some water from the river cherwell ,COMMA and the river thames ,COMMA that flow through here .PERIOD and this is the water .PERIOD 
so i've gone and got some stuff to add into it .PERIOD 
and this is from my pond .PERIOD 
have a smell of that ,COMMA mister cameraman .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD right .PERIOD 
we're just going to pour that in there .PERIOD 
audience :COLON ugh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
michael pritchard :COLON okay .PERIOD we've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm .PERIOD 
so i'm just going to put that in there .PERIOD 
put that in there .PERIOD there we go .PERIOD 
and some other bits and pieces ,COMMA chuck that in there .PERIOD 
and i've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit .PERIOD 
so we're just going to put that in there as well .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD now .PERIOD 
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .PERIOD 
you just scoop the water up .PERIOD 
today i'm going to use a jug just to show you all .PERIOD let's get a bit of that poo in there .PERIOD 
that's not dirty enough .PERIOD let's just stir that up a little bit .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA so i'm going to take this really filthy water ,COMMA and put it in here .PERIOD do you want a drink yet ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay .PERIOD there we go .PERIOD 
replace the top .PERIOD 
give it a few pumps .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's all that's necessary .PERIOD 
now as soon as i pop the teat ,COMMA sterile drinking water is going to come out .PERIOD 
i've got to be quick .PERIOD okay ,COMMA ready ?QUESTIONMARK 
that is safe ,COMMA sterile drinking water .PERIOD 
cheers .PERIOD 
there you go chris .PERIOD 
what's it taste of ?QUESTIONMARK 
chris anderson :COLON delicious .PERIOD 
michael pritchard :COLON okay .PERIOD 
let's see chris's program throughout the rest of the show .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay .PERIOD lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .PERIOD 
it'll last for <NUM> liters .PERIOD 
and when it's expired ,COMMA using failsafe technology ,COMMA the system will shut off ,COMMA protecting the user .PERIOD 
it's good for another <NUM> liters .PERIOD 
so let's look at the applications .PERIOD 
traditionally ,COMMA in a crisis ,COMMA what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
we ship water .PERIOD 
then ,COMMA after a few weeks ,COMMA we set up camps .PERIOD 
and people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water .PERIOD 
what happens when <NUM> people congregate in a camp ?QUESTIONMARK 
diseases spread .PERIOD more resources are required .PERIOD 
the problem just becomes self-perpetuating .PERIOD 
but by thinking differently ,COMMA and shipping these ,COMMA people can stay put .PERIOD 
they can make their own sterile drinking water ,COMMA and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work .PERIOD 
using the old thinking ,COMMA of national infrastructure and pipe work ,COMMA is too expensive .PERIOD 
when you run the numbers on a calculator ,COMMA you run out of noughts .PERIOD 
so here is the thinking different bit .PERIOD 
instead of shipping water ,COMMA and using man-made processes to do it ,COMMA let's use mother nature .PERIOD she's got a fantastic system .PERIOD 
she picks the water up from there ,COMMA desalinates it ,COMMA for free ,COMMA transports it over there ,COMMA and dumps it onto the mountains ,COMMA rivers ,COMMA and streams .PERIOD 
and where do people live ?QUESTIONMARK near water .PERIOD 
all we've go to do is make it sterile .PERIOD how do we do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA we could use the lifesaver bottle .PERIOD 
or we could use one of these .PERIOD 
the same technology ,COMMA in a jerry can .PERIOD 
this will process <NUM> liters of water ;SEMICOLON that's good enough for a family of four ,COMMA for three years .PERIOD 
and how much does it cost ?QUESTIONMARK 
thank you .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA by thinking differently ,COMMA and processing water at the point of use ,COMMA mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water .PERIOD 
they can get it from a source nearby .PERIOD 
so with just eight billion dollars ,COMMA we can hit the millennium goal's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .PERIOD 
but why stop there ?QUESTIONMARK 
with <NUM> billion dollars ,COMMA everyone can have access to safe drinking water .PERIOD 
so the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result ,COMMA and the two million kids that die every year ,COMMA will live .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
and it is .PERIOD 
i first learned that my son had been in the world trade center on the morning of september 11th ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
we didn't know if he had perished yet until <NUM> hours later .PERIOD 
at the time ,COMMA we knew that it was political .PERIOD 
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband ,COMMA orlando ,COMMA and i and our family .PERIOD 
and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism ,COMMA and the us .PERIOD government called for a death penalty for him ,COMMA if convicted ,COMMA my husband and i spoke out in opposition to that ,COMMA publicly .PERIOD 
through that and through human rights groups ,COMMA we were brought together with several other victims' families .PERIOD 
when i saw aicha in the media ,COMMA coming over when her son was indicted ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA what a brave woman .PERIOD 
someday i want to meet that woman when i'm stronger .PERIOD 
i was still in deep grief ;SEMICOLON i knew i didn't have the strength .PERIOD 
i knew i would find her someday ,COMMA or we would find each other .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA when people heard that my son was a victim ,COMMA i got immediate sympathy .PERIOD 
but when people learned what her son was accused of ,COMMA she didn't get that sympathy .PERIOD 
but her suffering is equal to mine .PERIOD 
so we met in november <NUM> ,COMMA and aicha will now tell you how that came about .PERIOD 
aicha el-wafi :COLON good afternoon ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD 
and i asked the organization of human rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .PERIOD 
so they introduced me to five families .PERIOD 
and i saw phyllis ,COMMA and i watched her .PERIOD 
she was the only mother in the group .PERIOD 
the others were brothers ,COMMA sisters .PERIOD 
and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother ,COMMA just like me .PERIOD 
i suffered a lot as a mother .PERIOD 
i was married when i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
i lost a child when i was <NUM> ,COMMA a second child when i was <NUM> .PERIOD 
so the story with zacarias was too much really .PERIOD 
and i still suffer ,COMMA because my son is like he's buried alive .PERIOD 
i know she really cried for her son .PERIOD 
but she knows where he is .PERIOD 
i don't know if he's alive .PERIOD i don't know if he's tortured .PERIOD 
i don't know what happened to him .PERIOD 
for all the women ,COMMA all the mothers that give life ,COMMA you can give back ,COMMA you can change .PERIOD 
it's up to us women ,COMMA because we are women ,COMMA because we love our children .PERIOD 
it's not against women ,COMMA it's for us ,COMMA for us women ,COMMA for our children .PERIOD 
i talk against violence ,COMMA against terrorism .PERIOD 
i go to schools to talk to young ,COMMA muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young .PERIOD 
this is why i'm here in front of you .PERIOD 
but we were all so nervous .PERIOD 
why does she want to meet us ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then she was nervous .PERIOD 
what did we want from each other ?QUESTIONMARK 
before we knew each others' names ,COMMA or anything ,COMMA we had embraced and wept .PERIOD 
then we sat in a circle with support ,COMMA with help ,COMMA from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .PERIOD 
and aicha started ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA i don't know if my son is guilty or innocent ,COMMA but i want to tell you how sorry i am for what happened to your families .PERIOD 
i know what it is to suffer ,COMMA and i feel that if there is a crime ,COMMA a person should be tried fairly and punished .PERIOD 
but she reached out to us in that way ,COMMA and it was ,COMMA i'd like to say ,COMMA it was an ice-breaker .PERIOD 
by the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever .PERIOD 
now what i learned from her ,COMMA is a woman ,COMMA not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then ,COMMA and what was being done to her son ,COMMA but the life she's had .PERIOD 
and i feel that we have a special connection ,COMMA which i value very much .PERIOD 
and i think it's all about being afraid of the other ,COMMA but making that step and then realizing ,COMMA hey ,COMMA this wasn't so hard .PERIOD 
who else can i meet that i don't know ,COMMA or that i'm so different from ?QUESTIONMARK 
so ,COMMA aicha ,COMMA do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?QUESTIONMARK 
because our time is up .PERIOD 
i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people ,COMMA the other .PERIOD 
you have to be generous ,COMMA and your hearts must be generous ,COMMA your mind must be generous .PERIOD 
you must be tolerant .PERIOD 
you have to fight against violence .PERIOD 
and i hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other .PERIOD 
this is what i wanted to say .PERIOD 
there's a poem written by a very famous english poet at the end of the 19th century .PERIOD 
it was said to echo in churchill's brain in the 1930s .PERIOD 
and the poem goes :COLON on the idle hill of summer ,COMMA lazy with the flow of streams ,COMMA hark i hear a distant drummer ,COMMA drumming like a sound in dreams ,COMMA far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by ,COMMA dear to friend and food to powder ,COMMA soldiers marching ,COMMA soon to die .PERIOD 
those who are interested in poetry ,COMMA the poem is a shropshire lad written by ae .PERIOD housman .PERIOD 
but what housman understood ,COMMA and you hear it in the symphonies of nielsen too ,COMMA was that the long ,COMMA hot ,COMMA silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close ,COMMA and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes .PERIOD 
and my message for you is that i believe we are condemned ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world ,COMMA the new powers that exist in the world ,COMMA are beginning to take form .PERIOD 
and these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times ,COMMA highly difficult times ,COMMA and all too often very bloody times .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA it happens about once every century .PERIOD 
you might argue that the last time it happened -- and that's what housman felt coming and what churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations ,COMMA the old powers of europe ,COMMA across the atlantic to the new emerging power of the united states of america -- the beginning of the american century .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA into the vacuum where the too-old european powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part :COLON the two great world wars .PERIOD 
mao zedong used to refer to them as the european civil wars ,COMMA and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA we live at one of those times .PERIOD 
but for us ,COMMA i want to talk about three factors today .PERIOD 
and the first of these ,COMMA the first two of these ,COMMA is about a shift in power .PERIOD 
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to ,COMMA which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now .PERIOD 
but let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world .PERIOD 
and what is happening today is ,COMMA in one sense ,COMMA frightening because it's never happened before .PERIOD 
we have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .PERIOD 
what's happening today is that the power that was encased ,COMMA held to accountability ,COMMA held to the rule of law ,COMMA within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage .PERIOD 
the globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets ,COMMA but actually it's the globalization of real power .PERIOD 
and where ,COMMA at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law ,COMMA on the international stage it is not .PERIOD 
the international stage and the global stage where power now resides :COLON the power of the internet ,COMMA the power of the satellite broadcasters ,COMMA the power of the money changers -- this vast money-go-round that circulates now <NUM> times the amount of money necessary for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently ,COMMA the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium-sized countries .PERIOD 
these live in a global space which is largely unregulated ,COMMA not subject to the rule of law ,COMMA and in which people may act free of constraint .PERIOD 
now that suits the powerful up to a moment .PERIOD 
it's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint ,COMMA but the lesson of history is that ,COMMA sooner or later ,COMMA unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated ,COMMA not just by the things you wanted -- international trade ,COMMA the internet ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -- but also by the things you don't want -- international criminality ,COMMA international terrorism .PERIOD 
the revelation of <NUM>/<NUM> is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth ,COMMA nevertheless ,COMMA those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright september morning .PERIOD 
it's said that something like <NUM> percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund <NUM>/<NUM> actually passed through the institutions of the twin towers which <NUM>/<NUM> destroyed .PERIOD 
you see ,COMMA our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel ,COMMA the internet ,COMMA satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison ,COMMA which is about destroying our systems and our ways .PERIOD 
sooner or later ,COMMA sooner or later ,COMMA the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow .PERIOD 
and if it is therefore the case ,COMMA as i believe it is ,COMMA that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power ,COMMA then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space .PERIOD 
and i believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim :COLON to bring governance to the global space .PERIOD 
now notice ,COMMA i'm not talking about government .PERIOD 
i'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution .PERIOD 
my own view ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more un .PERIOD institutions .PERIOD 
if we didn't have the un ,COMMA we'd have to invent it .PERIOD 
the world needs an international forum .PERIOD 
it needs a means by which you can legitimize international action .PERIOD 
but when it comes to governance of the global space ,COMMA my guess is this won't happen through the creation of more un .PERIOD institutions .PERIOD 
it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems ,COMMA treaty-based agreements ,COMMA to govern that global space .PERIOD 
and if you look ,COMMA you can see them happening ,COMMA already beginning to emerge .PERIOD 
the world trade organization :COLON treaty-based organization ,COMMA entirely treaty-based ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA powerful enough to hold even the most powerful ,COMMA the united states ,COMMA to account if necessary .PERIOD 
kyoto :COLON the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty-based organization .PERIOD 
the g20 :COLON we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation .PERIOD 
and that's what the g20 is ,COMMA a treaty-based institution .PERIOD 
now there's a problem there ,COMMA and we'll come back to it in a minute ,COMMA which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty-based institutions ,COMMA to fill that governance space ,COMMA then what happens to the weak who are left out ?QUESTIONMARK 
and that's a big problem ,COMMA and we'll return to it in just a second .PERIOD 
so there's my first message ,COMMA that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently ,COMMA then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space .PERIOD 
and watch that beginning to happen .PERIOD 
my second point is ,COMMA and i know i don't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing ,COMMA but power is not just shifting vertically ,COMMA it's also shifting horizontally .PERIOD 
you might argue that the story ,COMMA the history of civilizations ,COMMA has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the mediterranean ,COMMA the more recent ones in the ascendents of western power around the atlantic .PERIOD 
well it seems to me that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power ,COMMA broadly speaking ,COMMA away from nations gathered around the atlantic [seaboard] to the nations gathered around the pacific rim .PERIOD 
now that begins with economic power ,COMMA but that's the way it always begins .PERIOD 
you already begin to see the development of foreign policies ,COMMA the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world .PERIOD 
i think actually this is not so much a shift from the west to the east ;SEMICOLON something different is happening .PERIOD 
we are coming out of <NUM> years ,COMMA most unusual years ,COMMA of history in which we have had a totally mono-polar world ,COMMA in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA what's now emerging is the much more normal case of history .PERIOD 
you're beginning to see the emergence of a multi-polar world .PERIOD 
up until now ,COMMA the united states has been the dominant feature of our world .PERIOD 
they will remain the most powerful nation ,COMMA but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi-polar world .PERIOD 
and you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in china ,COMMA of course ,COMMA though my own guess is that china's ascent to greatness is not smooth .PERIOD 
it's going to be quite grumpy as china begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy .PERIOD 
but that's a subject of a different discussion .PERIOD 
you see india ,COMMA you see brazil .PERIOD 
you see increasingly that the world now looks actually ,COMMA for us europeans ,COMMA much more like europe in the 19th century .PERIOD 
europe in the 19th century :COLON a great british foreign secretary ,COMMA lord canning ,COMMA used to describe it as the european concert of powers .PERIOD 
there was a balance ,COMMA a five-sided balance .PERIOD 
britain always played to the balance .PERIOD 
if paris got together with berlin ,COMMA britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance .PERIOD 
now notice ,COMMA in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world ,COMMA you have fixed alliances -- nato ,COMMA the warsaw pact .PERIOD 
but a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances .PERIOD 
and that's the world we're coming into ,COMMA in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed .PERIOD 
and we will see increasingly that even we in the west will reach out ,COMMA have to reach out ,COMMA beyond the cozy circle of the atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world .PERIOD 
note ,COMMA that when we went into libya ,COMMA it was not good enough for the west to do it alone ;SEMICOLON we had to bring others in .PERIOD 
we had to bring ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA the arab league in .PERIOD 
my guess is iraq and afghanistan are the last times when the west has tried to do it themselves ,COMMA and we haven't succeeded .PERIOD 
my guess is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of <NUM> years -- i say <NUM> years because it's the end of the ottoman empire -- of the hegemony of western power ,COMMA western institutions and western values .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA up until now ,COMMA if the west got its act together ,COMMA it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world .PERIOD 
but that's no longer true .PERIOD 
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .PERIOD 
the west got together -- the bretton woods institution ,COMMA world bank ,COMMA international monetary fund -- the problem solved .PERIOD 
now we have to call in others .PERIOD 
now we have to create the g20 .PERIOD 
now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our western friends .PERIOD 
let me make a prediction for you ,COMMA which is probably even more startling .PERIOD 
i suspect we are now reaching the end of <NUM> years when western power was enough .PERIOD 
people say to me ,COMMA the chinese ,COMMA of course ,COMMA they'll never get themselves involved in peace-making ,COMMA multilateral peace-making around the world .PERIOD 
oh yes ?QUESTIONMARK why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
how many chinese troops are serving under the blue beret ,COMMA serving under the blue flag ,COMMA serving under the un .PERIOD command in the world today ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
how many americans ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
what is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of somali pirates ?QUESTIONMARK 
the chinese naval contingent .PERIOD 
of course they are ,COMMA they are a mercantilist nation .PERIOD 
they want to keep the sea lanes open .PERIOD 
increasingly ,COMMA we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values ,COMMA but with whom ,COMMA for the moment ,COMMA we share common interests .PERIOD 
it's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging .PERIOD 
and here's the third factor ,COMMA which is totally different .PERIOD 
today in our modern world ,COMMA because of the internet ,COMMA because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here ,COMMA everything is connected to everything .PERIOD 
we are now interdependent .PERIOD 
we are now interlocked ,COMMA as nations ,COMMA as individuals ,COMMA in a way which has never been the case before ,COMMA never been the case before .PERIOD 
the interrelationship of nations ,COMMA well it's always existed .PERIOD 
diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations .PERIOD 
but now we are intimately locked together .PERIOD 
you get swine flu in mexico ,COMMA it's a problem for charles de gaulle airport <NUM> hours later .PERIOD 
lehman brothers goes down ,COMMA the whole lot collapses .PERIOD 
there are fires in the steppes of russia ,COMMA food riots in africa .PERIOD 
we are all now deeply ,COMMA deeply ,COMMA deeply interconnected .PERIOD 
and what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone ,COMMA not connected with others ,COMMA not working with others ,COMMA is no longer a viable proposition .PERIOD 
because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself ,COMMA nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory ,COMMA because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them .PERIOD 
i was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of britain .PERIOD 
that was when the enemy was outside the walls .PERIOD 
now the enemy is inside the walls .PERIOD 
now if i want to talk about the defense of my country ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security ,COMMA i have to speak to the minister of industry because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- i have to speak to the minister of home affairs because who has entered my country ,COMMA who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in london saw in the <NUM>/<NUM> bombings .PERIOD 
it's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense .PERIOD 
it's its capacity to lock together its institutions .PERIOD 
and this tells you something very important .PERIOD 
it tells you that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA our governments ,COMMA vertically constructed ,COMMA constructed on the economic model of the industrial revolution -- vertical hierarchy ,COMMA specialization of tasks ,COMMA command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely .PERIOD 
you in business know that the paradigm structure of our time ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA is the network .PERIOD 
it's your capacity to network that matters ,COMMA both within your governments and externally .PERIOD 
so here is ashdown's third law .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA don't ask me about ashdown's first law and second law because i haven't invented those yet ;SEMICOLON it always sounds better if there's a third law ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
ashdown's third law is that in the modern age ,COMMA where everything is connected to everything ,COMMA the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others .PERIOD 
the most important bit about your structure -- whether you're a government ,COMMA whether you're an army regiment ,COMMA whether you're a business -- is your docking points ,COMMA your interconnectors ,COMMA your capacity to network with others .PERIOD 
you understand that in industry ;SEMICOLON governments don't .PERIOD 
if it is the case ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before ,COMMA then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other .PERIOD 
suddenly and for the very first time ,COMMA collective defense ,COMMA the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations ,COMMA is no longer enough .PERIOD 
it used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe ,COMMA i was safe ;SEMICOLON if my country was more powerful than their country ,COMMA i was safe ;SEMICOLON my alliance ,COMMA like nato ,COMMA was more powerful than their alliance ,COMMA i was safe .PERIOD 
it is no longer the case .PERIOD 
the advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA i share a destiny with my enemy .PERIOD 
when i was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the soviet union in geneva in the 1970s ,COMMA we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them .PERIOD 
they shared a destiny with their enemies .PERIOD 
one of the great barriers to peace in the middle east is that both sides ,COMMA both israel and ,COMMA i think ,COMMA the palestinians ,COMMA do not understand that they share a collective destiny .PERIOD 
the great poem of john donne's .PERIOD 
send not for whom the bell tolls .PERIOD 
the poem is called no man is an island .PERIOD 
and it goes :COLON every man's death affected me ,COMMA for i am involved in mankind ,COMMA send not to ask for whom the bell tolls ,COMMA it tolls for thee .PERIOD 
for us ,COMMA i think ,COMMA part of the equation for our survival .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
something called the danish twin study established that only about <NUM> percent of how long the average person lives ,COMMA within certain biological limits ,COMMA is dictated by our genes .PERIOD 
the other <NUM> percent is dictated by our lifestyle .PERIOD 
so the premise of blue zones :COLON if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity .PERIOD 
they've probably heard of the south beach diet ,COMMA or the atkins diet .PERIOD 
there is what oprah tells us .PERIOD 
there is what doctor oz tells us .PERIOD 
the fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better .PERIOD 
should you be running marathons or doing yoga ?QUESTIONMARK 
should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ?QUESTIONMARK 
when it comes to supplements ,COMMA should you be taking them ?QUESTIONMARK 
how about these hormones or resveratrol ?QUESTIONMARK 
and does purpose play into it ?QUESTIONMARK 
spirituality ?QUESTIONMARK and how about how we socialize ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA our approach to finding longevity was to team up with national geographic ,COMMA and the national institute on aging ,COMMA to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined .PERIOD 
and then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do ,COMMA to distill down the cross-cultural distillation .PERIOD 
and at the end of this i'm going to tell you what that distillation is .PERIOD 
but first i'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity .PERIOD 
and the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be <NUM> .PERIOD 
the problem is ,COMMA only about one out of <NUM> people in america live to be <NUM> .PERIOD 
your chances are very low .PERIOD 
even though it's the fastest growing demographic in america ,COMMA it's hard to reach <NUM> .PERIOD 
the problem is that we're not programmed for longevity .PERIOD 
we are programmed for something called procreative success .PERIOD 
i love that word .PERIOD 
biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation ,COMMA the age when your children have children .PERIOD 
after that the effect of evolution completely dissipates .PERIOD 
if you're a mammal ,COMMA if you're a rat or an elephant ,COMMA or a human ,COMMA in between ,COMMA it's the same story .PERIOD 
the second myth is ,COMMA there are treatments that can help slow ,COMMA reverse ,COMMA or even stop aging .PERIOD 
false .PERIOD 
when you think of it ,COMMA there is <NUM> things that can age us .PERIOD 
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes ,COMMA those brain cells die ,COMMA they never come back .PERIOD 
play tennis too hard ,COMMA on your knees ,COMMA ruin your cartilage ,COMMA the cartilage never comes back .PERIOD 
our arteries can clog .PERIOD our brains can gunk up with plaque ,COMMA and we can get alzheimer's .PERIOD 
there is just too many things to go wrong .PERIOD 
our bodies have <NUM> trillion cells ,COMMA trillion with a t .PERIOD we're talking national debt numbers here .PERIOD 
those cells turn themselves over once every eight years .PERIOD 
and every time they turn themselves over there is some damage .PERIOD and that damage builds up .PERIOD 
and it builds up exponentially .PERIOD 
it's a little bit like the days when we all had beatles albums or eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape ,COMMA and let our friends copy that cassette tape ,COMMA and pretty soon ,COMMA with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the same things happen to our cells .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging ,COMMA what am i doing here ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body ,COMMA my body ,COMMA your body ,COMMA is about <NUM> years ,COMMA a little bit more for women .PERIOD 
but life expectancy in this country is only <NUM> .PERIOD 
so somewhere along the line ,COMMA we're leaving about <NUM> good years on the table .PERIOD 
these are years that we could get .PERIOD 
we think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them ,COMMA areas where people are living to age <NUM> at rates up to <NUM> times greater than we are ,COMMA areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years ,COMMA the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country .PERIOD 
we found our first blue zone about <NUM> miles off the coast of italy ,COMMA on the island of sardinia .PERIOD 
and not the entire island ,COMMA the island is about <NUM> million people ,COMMA but only up in the highlands ,COMMA an area called the nuoro province .PERIOD 
and here we have this area where men live the longest ,COMMA about <NUM> times more centenarians than we have here in america .PERIOD 
and this is a place where people not only reach age <NUM> ,COMMA they do so with extraordinary vigor .PERIOD 
places where <NUM> year olds still ride their bike to work ,COMMA chop wood ,COMMA and can beat a guy <NUM> years younger than them .PERIOD 
their history actually goes back to about the time of christ .PERIOD 
it's actually a bronze age culture that's been isolated .PERIOD 
because the land is so infertile ,COMMA they largely are shepherds ,COMMA which occasions regular ,COMMA low-intensity physical activity .PERIOD 
their diet is mostly plant-based ,COMMA accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields .PERIOD 
they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat ,COMMA a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals ,COMMA and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .PERIOD 
it's called cannonau .PERIOD 
and one of the most salient elements of the sardinian society is how they treat older people .PERIOD 
you ever notice here in america ,COMMA social equity seems to peak at about age <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
here in sardinia ,COMMA the older you get the more equity you have ,COMMA the more wisdom you're celebrated for .PERIOD 
you go into the bars in sardinia ,COMMA instead of seeing the sports illustrated swimsuit calendar ,COMMA you see the centenarian of the month calendar .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA as it turns out ,COMMA is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it's also good for the children of those families ,COMMA who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease .PERIOD 
that's called the grandmother effect .PERIOD 
we found our second blue zone on the other side of the planet ,COMMA about <NUM> miles south of tokyo ,COMMA on the archipelago of okinawa .PERIOD 
okinawa is actually <NUM> small islands .PERIOD 
and in the northern part of the main island ,COMMA this is ground zero for world longevity .PERIOD 
this is a place where the oldest living female population is found .PERIOD 
it's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world .PERIOD 
they have what we want .PERIOD 
they live a long time ,COMMA and tend to die in their sleep ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA and often ,COMMA i can tell you ,COMMA after sex .PERIOD 
they live about seven good years longer than the average american .PERIOD 
five times as many centenarians as we have in america .PERIOD 
and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .PERIOD 
and the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us .PERIOD 
what do they do ?QUESTIONMARK 
once again ,COMMA a plant-based diet ,COMMA full of vegetables with lots of color in them .PERIOD 
and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do .PERIOD 
more significant than what they eat is how they eat it .PERIOD 
they have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating ,COMMA which ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big problem here in america .PERIOD 
a few of the strategies we observed :COLON they eat off of smaller plates ,COMMA so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting .PERIOD 
instead of serving family style ,COMMA where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking ,COMMA they serve at the counter ,COMMA put the food away ,COMMA and then bring it to the table .PERIOD 
they also have a 3000-year-old adage ,COMMA which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented .PERIOD 
it was invented by confucius .PERIOD 
and that diet is known as the hara ,COMMA hatchi ,COMMA bu diet .PERIOD 
it's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [<NUM>] percent full .PERIOD 
it takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain .PERIOD 
and by remembering to stop at <NUM> percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA like sardinia ,COMMA okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .PERIOD 
we know that isolation kills .PERIOD 
fifteen years ago ,COMMA the average american had three good friends .PERIOD 
if you were lucky enough to be born in okinawa ,COMMA you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life .PERIOD 
they call it a moai .PERIOD and if you're in a moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck ,COMMA and if things go bad ,COMMA child gets sick ,COMMA parent dies ,COMMA you always have somebody who has your back .PERIOD 
their average age is <NUM> .PERIOD 
typically in america we've divided our adult life up into two sections .PERIOD 
there is our work life ,COMMA where we're productive .PERIOD 
and typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair ,COMMA or going down to arizona to play golf .PERIOD 
in the okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement .PERIOD 
instead there is one word that imbues your entire life ,COMMA and that word is ikigai .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA roughly translated ,COMMA it means the reason for which you wake up in the morning .PERIOD 
for this 102-year-old karate master ,COMMA his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art .PERIOD 
for this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week .PERIOD 
and this is a question .PERIOD the national institute on aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians .PERIOD 
and one of the questions ,COMMA they were very culturally astute ,COMMA the people who put the questionnaire .PERIOD 
one of the questions was ,COMMA what is your ikigai ?QUESTIONMARK 
they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning .PERIOD 
for this <NUM> year old woman ,COMMA her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter .PERIOD 
two girls separated in age by <NUM> and a half years .PERIOD 
and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter .PERIOD 
and she put her head back and she said ,COMMA it feels like leaping into heaven .PERIOD 
i thought that was a wonderful thought .PERIOD 
my editor at geographic wanted me to find america's blue zone .PERIOD 
and for a while we looked on the prairies of minnesota ,COMMA where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians .PERIOD 
but that's because all the young people left .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we turned to the data again .PERIOD 
and we found america's longest-lived population among the seventh-day adventists concentrated in and around loma linda ,COMMA california .PERIOD 
adventists are conservative methodists .PERIOD 
they celebrate their sabbath from sunset on friday till sunset on saturday .PERIOD 
a 24-hour sanctuary in time ,COMMA they call it .PERIOD 
and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity ,COMMA comparatively speaking .PERIOD 
in america here ,COMMA life expectancy for the average woman is <NUM> .PERIOD 
but for an adventist woman ,COMMA their life expectancy is <NUM> .PERIOD 
and the difference is even more pronounced among men ,COMMA who are expected to live about <NUM> years longer than their american counterparts .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA this is a study that followed about <NUM> people for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
sterling study .PERIOD and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project .PERIOD 
this is a heterogeneous community .PERIOD 
it's white ,COMMA black ,COMMA hispanic ,COMMA asian .PERIOD 
the only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives .PERIOD 
they take their diet directly from the bible .PERIOD 
genesis :COLON chapter one ,COMMA verse [<NUM>] ,COMMA where god talks about legumes and seeds ,COMMA and on one more stanza about green plants ,COMMA ostensibly missing is meat .PERIOD 
they take this sanctuary in time very serious .PERIOD 
for <NUM> hours every week ,COMMA no matter how busy they are ,COMMA how stressed out they are at work ,COMMA where the kids need to be driven ,COMMA they stop everything and they focus on their god ,COMMA their social network ,COMMA and then ,COMMA hardwired right in the religion ,COMMA are nature walks .PERIOD 
and the power of this is not that it's done occasionally ,COMMA the power is it's done every week for a lifetime .PERIOD 
none of it's hard .PERIOD none of it costs money .PERIOD 
adventists also tend to hang out with other adventists .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you go to an adventist's party you don't see people swilling jim beam or rolling a joint .PERIOD 
instead they're talking about their next nature walk ,COMMA exchanging recipes ,COMMA and yes ,COMMA they pray .PERIOD 
this is a culture that has yielded ellsworth whareham .PERIOD 
ellsworth whareham is <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
he's a multimillionaire ,COMMA yet when a contractor wanted <NUM> dollars to build a privacy fence ,COMMA he said ,COMMA for that kind of money i'll do it myself .PERIOD 
so for the next three days he was out shoveling cement ,COMMA and hauling poles around .PERIOD 
and predictably ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .PERIOD 
but not as the guy on the table ;SEMICOLON the guy doing open-heart surgery .PERIOD 
at <NUM> he still does <NUM> open-heart surgeries every month .PERIOD 
ed rawlings ,COMMA <NUM> years old now ,COMMA an active cowboy ,COMMA starts his morning with a swim .PERIOD 
and on weekends he likes to put on the boards ,COMMA throw up rooster tails .PERIOD 
and then marge deton .PERIOD 
marge is <NUM> .PERIOD 
her grandson actually lives in the twin cities here .PERIOD 
she starts her day with lifting weights .PERIOD 
she rides her bicycle .PERIOD 
and then she gets in her root-beer colored <NUM> cadillac seville ,COMMA and tears down the san bernardino freeway ,COMMA where she still volunteers for seven different organizations .PERIOD 
i've been on <NUM> hardcore expeditions .PERIOD 
i'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen .PERIOD 
but i'll tell you ,COMMA there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with marge deton .PERIOD 
a stranger is a friend i haven't met yet !EXCLAMATIONMARK she'd say to me .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what are the common denominators in these three cultures ?QUESTIONMARK 
what are the things that they all do ?QUESTIONMARK 
and we managed to boil it down to nine .PERIOD 
in fact we've done two more blue zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true .PERIOD 
and the first one ,COMMA and i'm about to utter a heresy here ,COMMA none of them exercise ,COMMA at least the way we think of exercise .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity .PERIOD 
these 100-year-old okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground ,COMMA they sit on the floor ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> times a day .PERIOD 
sardinians live in vertical houses ,COMMA up and down the stairs .PERIOD 
every trip to the store ,COMMA or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk .PERIOD 
there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work .PERIOD 
if they want to mix up a cake ,COMMA they're doing it by hand .PERIOD 
that's physical activity .PERIOD 
when they do do intentional physical activity ,COMMA it's the things they enjoy .PERIOD they tend to walk ,COMMA the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline ,COMMA and they all tend to have a garden .PERIOD 
each of these cultures take time to downshift .PERIOD 
the sardinians pray .PERIOD the seventh-day adventists pray .PERIOD 
the okinawans have this ancestor veneration .PERIOD 
but when you're in a hurry or stressed out ,COMMA that triggers something called the inflammatory response ,COMMA which is associated with everything from alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease .PERIOD 
when you slow down for <NUM> minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state .PERIOD 
they have vocabulary for sense of purpose ,COMMA ikigai ,COMMA like the okinawans .PERIOD 
these people know their sense of purpose ,COMMA and they activate in their life ,COMMA that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy .PERIOD 
there's no longevity diet .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA these people drink a little bit every day ,COMMA not a hard sell to the american population .PERIOD 
they tend to eat a plant-based diet .PERIOD 
doesn't mean they don't eat meat ,COMMA but lots of beans and nuts .PERIOD 
they put their families first ,COMMA take care of their children and their aging parents .PERIOD 
they all tend to belong to a faith-based community ,COMMA which is worth between four and <NUM> extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month .PERIOD 
and the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe .PERIOD 
they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people .PERIOD 
we know from the framingham studies ,COMMA that if your three best friends are obese there is a <NUM> percent better chance that you'll be overweight .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you hang out with unhealthy people ,COMMA that's going to have a measurable impact over time .PERIOD 
instead ,COMMA if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity ,COMMA bowling ,COMMA or playing hockey ,COMMA biking or gardening ,COMMA if your friends drink a little ,COMMA but not too much ,COMMA and they eat right ,COMMA and they're engaged ,COMMA and they're trusting and trustworthy ,COMMA that is going to have the biggest impact over time .PERIOD 
exercise programs usually start in january ;SEMICOLON they're usually done by october .PERIOD 
when it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else .PERIOD 
but when you think about it ,COMMA your friends are long-term adventures ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life ,COMMA and life to your years .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier .PERIOD 
and i want to tell you that story .PERIOD 
i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics .PERIOD 
it's a competition we're holding ,COMMA the second x prize ,COMMA for the first team to sequence <NUM> human genomes in <NUM> days .PERIOD 
we have something called the genome <NUM> -- <NUM> individuals we're sequencing as part of that .PERIOD 
craig venter chairs that event .PERIOD 
and i met professor hawking ,COMMA and he said his dream was to travel into space .PERIOD 
and i said ,COMMA i can't take you there ,COMMA but i can take you into weightlessness into zero-g .PERIOD 
and he said ,COMMA on the spot ,COMMA absolutely ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA the only way to experience zero-g on earth is actually with parabolic flight ,COMMA weightless flight .PERIOD 
you take an airplane ,COMMA you fly over the top ,COMMA you're weightless for <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
come back down ,COMMA you weigh twice as much .PERIOD 
you do it again and again .PERIOD 
we set out to do this .PERIOD 
it took us <NUM> years to become operational .PERIOD 
and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking .PERIOD 
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say ,COMMA you're crazy ,COMMA don't do that ,COMMA you're going kill the guy .PERIOD 
and he wanted to go .PERIOD 
we worked hard to get all the permissions .PERIOD 
and six months later ,COMMA we sat down at kennedy space center .PERIOD 
we had a press conference ,COMMA we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola ,COMMA give him <NUM> seconds of zero-g .PERIOD 
and if it went really well ,COMMA we might do three parabolas .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .PERIOD 
and what he said ,COMMA for me ,COMMA was very moving .PERIOD 
he said ,COMMA life on earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster . .PERIOD 
i think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space .PERIOD 
i therefore want to encourage public interest in space .PERIOD 
we took him out to the kennedy space center ,COMMA up inside the nasa vehicle ,COMMA into the back of the zero-g airplane .PERIOD 
we had about <NUM> people who made donations -- we raised $150000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us .PERIOD 
a few tedsters here .PERIOD 
we set up a whole er .PERIOD 
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .PERIOD 
we were monitoring his po2 of his blood ,COMMA his heart rate ,COMMA his blood pressure .PERIOD 
we had everything all set in case of an emergency ;SEMICOLON god knows ,COMMA you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert .PERIOD 
we took off from the shuttle landing facility ,COMMA where the shuttle takes off and lands .PERIOD 
and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero-g .PERIOD 
once he was there ,COMMA [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like .PERIOD 
and after that first parabola ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the doc said everything is great .PERIOD he was smiling ,COMMA and we said go .PERIOD 
so we did a second parabola .PERIOD 
and a third .PERIOD 
we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did .PERIOD 
and we did a fourth ,COMMA and a fifth and a sixth .PERIOD 
and a seventh and an eighth .PERIOD 
and this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man .PERIOD 
he was so happy .PERIOD 
we are living on a precious jewel ,COMMA and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet .PERIOD 
please join us in this epic adventure .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
i'm a medical illustrator ,COMMA and i come from a slightly different point of view .PERIOD 
i've been watching ,COMMA since i grew up ,COMMA the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences .PERIOD 
and while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date .PERIOD 
these are expressions of truth as awe-full things ,COMMA by meaning they are things you can worship .PERIOD 
they are ideals that are powerful .PERIOD they are irreducible .PERIOD 
they are unique .PERIOD they are useful -- sometimes ,COMMA often a long time after the fact .PERIOD 
truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences .PERIOD 
they are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed .PERIOD 
if you look at the math ,COMMA e=mc squared ,COMMA if you look at the cosmological constant ,COMMA where there's an anthropic ideal ,COMMA where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand .PERIOD 
and what i've tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator -- since i was taught animation by my father ,COMMA who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation ,COMMA by using pictures ,COMMA by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth ,COMMA and can be taught ,COMMA and can be understood .PERIOD 
students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them ,COMMA but the way they're taught is compartmentalized and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident .PERIOD 
we don't want to do that to our students .PERIOD 
so we have an opportunity to really open up education .PERIOD 
and i had a telephone call from robert lue at harvard ,COMMA in the molecular and cellular biology department ,COMMA a couple of years ago .PERIOD he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard .PERIOD 
so we embarked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on .PERIOD 
they could have a mental image of the cell as a large ,COMMA bustling ,COMMA hugely complicated city that's occupied by micro-machines .PERIOD 
and these micro-machines really are at the heart of life .PERIOD 
and these micro-machines power how a cell moves .PERIOD 
they power how a cell replicates .PERIOD they power our hearts .PERIOD 
they power our minds .PERIOD 
and so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of biovisions at harvard ,COMMA which is a website that harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information ,COMMA in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually ,COMMA so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty ,COMMA and be able to study with this view in mind ,COMMA so that their imaginations would be sparked ,COMMA so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out ,COMMA really ,COMMA how life works .PERIOD 
so we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together .PERIOD 
we worked with a theme ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary ,COMMA and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall ,COMMA and they're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall ,COMMA and they are given this information that there's an inflammation somewhere outside ,COMMA where they can't see and sense .PERIOD 
but they get the information that causes them to stop ,COMMA causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape ,COMMA and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on .PERIOD 
so these molecular motors -- we had to work with the harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved ,COMMA and figure out what they did .PERIOD 
and figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on ,COMMA but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening .PERIOD 
and i want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines ,COMMA they're called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size .PERIOD 
run the movie ,COMMA please .PERIOD 
but these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing ,COMMA and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other .PERIOD 
they pass information to each other .PERIOD 
they cause different things to happen inside the cell .PERIOD 
and the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly ,COMMA from information that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes .PERIOD 
no life ,COMMA from the smallest life to everybody here ,COMMA would be possible without these little micro-machines .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA it would really ,COMMA in the absence of these machines ,COMMA have made the attendance here ,COMMA chris ,COMMA really quite sparse .PERIOD 
this is the fedex delivery guy of the cell .PERIOD 
this little guy is called the kinesin ,COMMA and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it's needed in the cell -- whether it's to a membrane ,COMMA whether it's to an organelle ,COMMA whether it's to build something or repair something .PERIOD 
so what i want you to do when you go home is think about this ,COMMA and think about how powerful our cells are .PERIOD 
and think about some of the things that we're learning about cellular mechanics .PERIOD 
once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me ,COMMA we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on ,COMMA we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health ,COMMA with what we do with future generations ,COMMA and how long we're going to live .PERIOD 
and hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth ,COMMA and more beauty .PERIOD 
but it's really quite amazing that these cells ,COMMA these micro-machines ,COMMA are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding .PERIOD 
they work together .PERIOD they make the cell do what it needs to do .PERIOD 
and their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly .PERIOD 
enjoy the rest of the show .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i'm a writer and a journalist ,COMMA and i'm also an insanely curious person ,COMMA so in <NUM> years as a journalist ,COMMA i've learned how to do a lot of new things .PERIOD 
i became one of the working homeless .PERIOD 
i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year ,COMMA and decided to travel .PERIOD 
his death hit me pretty hard .PERIOD 
and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that .PERIOD 
i've camped my whole life .PERIOD and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .PERIOD 
so i packed my cat ,COMMA my rottweiler and my camping gear into a <NUM> chevy van ,COMMA and drove off into the sunset ,COMMA having fully failed to realize three critical things .PERIOD 
one :COLON that society equates living in a permanent structure ,COMMA even a shack ,COMMA with having value as a person .PERIOD 
two :COLON i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality ,COMMA if we let it .PERIOD 
three :COLON i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude ,COMMA not a lifestyle .PERIOD 
at first ,COMMA living in the van was great .PERIOD 
i showered in campgrounds .PERIOD i ate out regularly .PERIOD 
and i had time to relax and to grieve .PERIOD 
but then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in .PERIOD 
my freelance job ended .PERIOD and i had to get a full-time job to pay the bills .PERIOD 
what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer .PERIOD 
and it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that i had a cat and a dog with me ,COMMA and it was really hot .PERIOD 
the cat came and went through an open window in the van .PERIOD 
the doggy went into doggy day care .PERIOD 
and i sweated .PERIOD 
whenever i could ,COMMA i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops .PERIOD 
or i washed up in public rest rooms .PERIOD 
nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below <NUM> degrees fahrenheit ,COMMA making it difficult or impossible to sleep .PERIOD 
food rotted in the heat .PERIOD 
ice in my ice chest melted within hours ,COMMA and it was pretty miserable .PERIOD 
i couldn't afford to find an apartment ,COMMA or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat .PERIOD 
and i refused to give them up ,COMMA so i stayed in the van .PERIOD 
and when the heat made me too sick to walk the <NUM> feet to the public restroom outside my van at night ,COMMA i used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .PERIOD 
when winter weather set in ,COMMA the temperatures dropped below freezing .PERIOD and they stayed there .PERIOD 
and i faced a whole new set of challenges .PERIOD 
i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .PERIOD 
but i felt out of control of my life .PERIOD 
and i don't know when or how it happened ,COMMA but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman ,COMMA living in a van ,COMMA took my breath away .PERIOD 
i hadn't changed .PERIOD my iq .PERIOD hadn't dropped .PERIOD 
my talent ,COMMA my integrity ,COMMA my values ,COMMA everything about me remained the same .PERIOD 
but i had changed somehow .PERIOD 
i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .PERIOD 
and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .PERIOD 
and i went .PERIOD i hadn't bathed in three days .PERIOD 
i was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line .PERIOD 
i just wasn't drunk or high .PERIOD 
and when several of the homeless men realized that ,COMMA including a former university professor ,COMMA they said ,COMMA you aren't homeless .PERIOD why are you really here ?QUESTIONMARK 
other homeless people didn't see me as homeless ,COMMA but i did .PERIOD 
then the professor listened to my story and he said ,COMMA you have a job .PERIOD you have hope .PERIOD 
the real homeless don't have hope .PERIOD 
a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal .PERIOD and i remember thinking ,COMMA if i killed myself ,COMMA no one would notice .PERIOD 
an essay i'd written about my father ,COMMA the year before he died ,COMMA was in tim's new book .PERIOD 
and he was doing the talk show circuit .PERIOD and he was talking about my writing .PERIOD 
and when i realized that tim russert ,COMMA former moderator of meet the press ,COMMA was talking about my writing ,COMMA while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot ,COMMA i started laughing .PERIOD 
you should too .PERIOD 
i started laughing because it got to the point where ,COMMA was i a writer ,COMMA or was i a homeless woman ?QUESTIONMARK 
so i went in the bookstore .PERIOD and i found tim's book .PERIOD 
and i stood there .PERIOD and i reread my essay .PERIOD 
and i cried .PERIOD 
because i was a writer .PERIOD 
i was a writer .PERIOD 
shortly after that i moved back to tennessee .PERIOD 
i alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends .PERIOD 
and i started writing again .PERIOD 
by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist .PERIOD 
i was winning awards .PERIOD i was living in my own apartment .PERIOD 
i was no longer homeless .PERIOD 
and i was no longer invisible .PERIOD 
thousands of people work full and part-time jobs ,COMMA and live in their cars .PERIOD 
but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .PERIOD 
so the homeless ,COMMA the working homeless ,COMMA primarily remain invisible .PERIOD 
but if you ever meet one ,COMMA engage them ,COMMA encourage them ,COMMA and offer them hope .PERIOD 
the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .PERIOD 
and i'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .PERIOD 
i'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet .PERIOD 
but i am here to tell you that ,COMMA based on my experience ,COMMA people are not where they live ,COMMA where they sleep ,COMMA or what their life situation is at any given time .PERIOD 
three years ago i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot ,COMMA and today i'm speaking at ted .PERIOD 
hope always ,COMMA always finds a way .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
welcome to thailand .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA when i was a young man -- <NUM> years ago ,COMMA the country was very ,COMMA very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .PERIOD 
we decided to do something about it ,COMMA but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program .PERIOD 
but we began with a family-planning program ,COMMA following a very successful maternal child health activity ,COMMA sets of activities .PERIOD 
so basically ,COMMA no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive .PERIOD 
so the first step :COLON get to the children ,COMMA get to the mothers ,COMMA and then follow up with family planning .PERIOD 
not just child mortality alone ,COMMA you need also family planning .PERIOD 
now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it .PERIOD 
seven children per family -- tremendous growth at <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
there was just no future .PERIOD 
we needed to reduce the population growth rate .PERIOD 
so we said ,COMMA let's do it .PERIOD 
we didn't take no as an answer ;SEMICOLON we took no as a question .PERIOD 
we went to the nurses and the midwives ,COMMA who were also women ,COMMA and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill .PERIOD 
that was wonderful ,COMMA but it covered only <NUM> percent of the country .PERIOD 
what do we do for the other <NUM> percent -- leave them alone and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA they're not medical personnel .PERIOD 
no ,COMMA we decided to do a bit more .PERIOD 
so we went to the ordinary people that you saw .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA below that yellow sign -- i wish they hadn't wiped that ,COMMA because there was coca-cola there .PERIOD 
we were so much bigger than coca-cola in those days .PERIOD 
and no difference ,COMMA the people they chose were the people we chose .PERIOD 
they were well-known in the community ,COMMA they knew that customers were always right ,COMMA and they were terrific ,COMMA and they practiced their family planning themselves .PERIOD 
so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country ,COMMA in every village of the country .PERIOD 
so there we are .PERIOD we went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution .PERIOD 
and then we decided ,COMMA why not get to religion because in the philippines ,COMMA the catholic church was pretty strong ,COMMA and thai people were buddhist .PERIOD 
we went to them and they said ,COMMA look ,COMMA could you help us ?QUESTIONMARK 
i'm there -- the one in blue ,COMMA not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family .PERIOD 
and this picture was sent throughout the country .PERIOD 
so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves .PERIOD 
and the women were saying ,COMMA no wonder we have no side-effects .PERIOD 
it's been blessed .PERIOD 
that was their perception .PERIOD 
and then we went to teachers .PERIOD 
you need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place .PERIOD 
so we went to the teachers .PERIOD 
over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- a ,COMMA b for birth ,COMMA c for condom ,COMMA i for iud ,COMMA v for vasectomy .PERIOD 
and then we had a snakes and ladders game ,COMMA where you throw dice .PERIOD 
if you land on anything pro-family planning ,COMMA you move ahead .PERIOD 
like ,COMMA mother takes the pill every night .PERIOD 
very good ,COMMA mother .PERIOD move ahead .PERIOD 
uncle buys a condom .PERIOD very good ,COMMA uncle .PERIOD move ahead .PERIOD 
uncle gets drunk ,COMMA doesn't use condom .PERIOD come back ,COMMA start again .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA education ,COMMA class entertainment .PERIOD 
and the kids were doing it in school too .PERIOD 
we had relay races with condoms ,COMMA we had children's condom-blowing championship .PERIOD 
and before long ,COMMA the condom was know as the girl's best friend .PERIOD 
in thailand ,COMMA for poor people ,COMMA diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend .PERIOD 
if you're pregnant ,COMMA take care of your pregnancy .PERIOD 
if you're not pregnant ,COMMA you can take a loan out from us .PERIOD 
and that was run by them .PERIOD 
and after <NUM>/<NUM> years ,COMMA it's still going on .PERIOD 
and we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves .PERIOD 
and you probably hardly see a thai man there ,COMMA it's always women ,COMMA women ,COMMA women ,COMMA women .PERIOD 
and this is on the fourth of july .PERIOD 
we decided to provide vasectomy to all men ,COMMA but in particular ,COMMA american men to the front of the queue ,COMMA right up to the ambassador's residence during his [unclear] .PERIOD 
and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room .PERIOD 
and since it was near lunch time ,COMMA they said ,COMMA all right ,COMMA we'll give you some lunch .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA it must be american cola .PERIOD 
you get two brands ,COMMA coke and pepsi .PERIOD 
and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog .PERIOD 
and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .PERIOD 
and here is this ,COMMA then ,COMMA young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid .PERIOD 
obviously ,COMMA he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten ,COMMA and he was very happy .PERIOD 
it made a lot of news in america ,COMMA and it angered some people also .PERIOD 
in all this thing ,COMMA from seven children to <NUM> children ,COMMA population growth rate of <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
you could call it the coca-cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .PERIOD 
i'm not sure whether coca-cola followed us ,COMMA or we followed coca-cola ,COMMA but we're good friends .PERIOD 
and so that's the case of everyone joining in .PERIOD 
we didn't have a strong government .PERIOD we didn't have lots of doctors .PERIOD 
but it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior .PERIOD 
so our work wasn't affected .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA if you can't go to the government ,COMMA go to the military .PERIOD 
so i went to the military and asked to borrow <NUM> radio stations .PERIOD 
they have more than the government ,COMMA and they've got more guns than the government .PERIOD 
so i asked them ,COMMA could they help us in our fight against hiv .PERIOD 
and after i gave them statistics ,COMMA they said ,COMMA yes .PERIOD okay .PERIOD you can use all the radio stations ,COMMA television stations .PERIOD 
and that's when we went onto the airwaves .PERIOD 
and then we got a new prime minister soon after that .PERIOD 
he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .PERIOD 
so i said ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
every ministry ,COMMA even judges ,COMMA had to be involved in aids education -- everyone -- and we said the public ,COMMA institutions ,COMMA religious institutions ,COMMA schools -- everyone was involved .PERIOD 
and here ,COMMA every media person had to be trained for hiv .PERIOD 
and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money .PERIOD 
so they were happy with that .PERIOD 
and then aids education in all schools ,COMMA starting from university .PERIOD 
and these are high school kids teaching high school kids .PERIOD 
and the best teachers were the girls ,COMMA not the boys ,COMMA and they were terrific .PERIOD 
and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa .PERIOD 
and then we went down one more step .PERIOD 
these are primary school kids -- third ,COMMA fourth grade -- going to every household in the village ,COMMA every household in the whole of thailand ,COMMA giving aids information and a condom to every household ,COMMA given by these young kids .PERIOD 
and no parents objected ,COMMA because we were trying to save lives ,COMMA and this was a lifesaver .PERIOD 
and we said ,COMMA everyone needs to be involved .PERIOD 
so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work ,COMMA and dead customers don't buy .PERIOD 
so they all trained .PERIOD 
and then we have this captain condom ,COMMA with his harvard mba ,COMMA going to schools and night spots .PERIOD 
and they loved him .PERIOD you need a symbol of something .PERIOD 
in every country ,COMMA every program ,COMMA you need a symbol ,COMMA and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his mba .PERIOD 
in taxis ,COMMA you get condoms .PERIOD 
and also ,COMMA in traffic ,COMMA the policemen give you condoms -- our cops and rubbers programs .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms ?QUESTIONMARK 
of course i can .PERIOD and they'd enjoy it immensely ;SEMICOLON i see them standing around right now ,COMMA everywhere .PERIOD 
imagine if they had condoms ,COMMA giving out to all sorts of people .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA new change ,COMMA we had hair bands ,COMMA clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season .PERIOD 
and these were the condoms that we introduced .PERIOD 
one says ,COMMA weapon of mass protection .PERIOD 
we found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction ,COMMA but we have found the weapon of mass protection :COLON the condom .PERIOD 
and then it says here ,COMMA with the american flag ,COMMA don't leave home without it .PERIOD 
but i have some to give out afterward .PERIOD 
but let me warn you ,COMMA these are thai-sized ,COMMA so be very careful .PERIOD 
and so you can see that condoms can do so many things .PERIOD 
look at this -- i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also .PERIOD 
stop global warming ;SEMICOLON use condoms .PERIOD 
and let the next olympics save some lives .PERIOD 
why just run around ?QUESTIONMARK 
and then finally ,COMMA in thailand we're buddhist ,COMMA we don't have a god ,COMMA so instead ,COMMA we say ,COMMA in rubber we trust .PERIOD 
so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people .PERIOD 
we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools ,COMMA because alcohol impairs judgment .PERIOD 
and then what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
after all this time ,COMMA everybody joined in .PERIOD 
according to the un ,COMMA new cases of hiv declined by <NUM> percent ,COMMA and according to the world bank ,COMMA <NUM> million lives were saved .PERIOD 
otherwise there wouldn't be many thais walking around today .PERIOD 
so it just showed you ,COMMA you could do something about it .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the funding came from thailand .PERIOD 
there was political commitment ,COMMA some financial commitment ,COMMA and everybody joined in the fight .PERIOD 
so just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses .PERIOD 
and then we decided to help people out of poverty ,COMMA now that we got aids somewhat out of the way -- this time ,COMMA not with government alone ,COMMA but in cooperation with the business community .PERIOD 
because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit .PERIOD 
those are the things to be provided by the business community .PERIOD 
we're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs ,COMMA little business people .PERIOD 
the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA that was done .PERIOD 
the money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting .PERIOD 
it's not a free gift .PERIOD 
they plant the trees ,COMMA and the money goes into their microcredit fund ,COMMA which we call the village development bank .PERIOD 
everybody joins in ,COMMA and they feel they own the bank ,COMMA because they have brought the money in .PERIOD 
and we believe if you want to help the poor ,COMMA those who are living in poverty ,COMMA access to credit must be a human right .PERIOD 
access to credit must be a human right .PERIOD 
and then before getting a loan ,COMMA you must be trained .PERIOD 
here's what we call a barefoot mba ,COMMA teaching people how to do business so that ,COMMA when they borrow money ,COMMA they'll succeed with the business .PERIOD 
these are some of the businesses :COLON mushrooms ,COMMA crabs ,COMMA vegetables ,COMMA trees ,COMMA fruits ,COMMA and this is very interesting -- nike ice cream and nike biscuits ;SEMICOLON this is a village sponsored by nike .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA they should stop making shoes and clothes .PERIOD 
make these better ,COMMA because we can afford them .PERIOD 
and then we have silk ,COMMA thai silk .PERIOD 
now we're making scottish tartans ,COMMA as you can see on the left ,COMMA to sell to all people of scottish ancestors .PERIOD 
so anyone sitting in and watching tv ,COMMA get in touch with me .PERIOD 
and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand -- coffee and condoms .PERIOD 
see ,COMMA starbucks you awake ,COMMA we keep you awake and alive .PERIOD 
that's the difference .PERIOD 
can you imagine ,COMMA at every starbucks that you can also get condoms ?QUESTIONMARK 
you can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino .PERIOD 
and then now ,COMMA finally in education ,COMMA we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone .PERIOD 
we call this our school-based integrated rural development .PERIOD 
re-do the school ,COMMA make it serve the community needs .PERIOD 
and here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo .PERIOD 
this is a geodesic dome made of bamboo .PERIOD 
and i'm sure buckminster fuller would be very ,COMMA very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome .PERIOD 
and we use vegetables around the school ground ,COMMA so they raise their own vegetables .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA finally ,COMMA i firmly believe ,COMMA if we want the mdgs to work -- the millennium development goals -- we need to add family planning to it .PERIOD 
of course ,COMMA child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it's underutilized .PERIOD 
and we also ask the next olympics to be involved in saving lives .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA finally ,COMMA that is our network .PERIOD 
and these are our thai tulips .PERIOD 
thank you very much indeed .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD it's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart .PERIOD 
i'm here to tell you a few tales of passion .PERIOD 
there's a jewish saying that i love .PERIOD 
what is truer than truth ?QUESTIONMARK answer :COLON the story .PERIOD 
i'm a storyteller .PERIOD i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity .PERIOD 
all stories interest me ,COMMA and some haunt me until i end up writing them .PERIOD 
certain themes keep coming up :COLON justice ,COMMA loyalty ,COMMA violence ,COMMA death ,COMMA political and social issues ,COMMA freedom .PERIOD 
i'm aware of the mystery around us ,COMMA so i write about coincidences ,COMMA premonitions ,COMMA emotions ,COMMA dreams ,COMMA the power of nature ,COMMA magic .PERIOD 
allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame .PERIOD 
one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony ,COMMA of the opening ceremony ,COMMA called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers .PERIOD 
i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i'm as far as you can get from being an athlete .PERIOD 
actually ,COMMA i wasn't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker .PERIOD 
i was told that this was no laughing matter .PERIOD 
this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag .PERIOD 
five women ,COMMA representing five continents ,COMMA and three olympic gold medal winners .PERIOD 
my first question was ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA what was i going to wear ?QUESTIONMARK 
a uniform ,COMMA she said ,COMMA and asked for my measurements .PERIOD 
i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak ,COMMA looking like the michelin man .PERIOD 
by the middle of february ,COMMA i found myself in turin ,COMMA where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the <NUM> olympic teams was in the street .PERIOD 
they all deserved to win ,COMMA but there's the element of luck .PERIOD 
a speck of snow ,COMMA an inch of ice ,COMMA the force of the wind ,COMMA can determine the result of a race or a game .PERIOD 
however ,COMMA what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart .PERIOD 
only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal .PERIOD 
it is all about passion .PERIOD 
the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics .PERIOD 
passion lives here .PERIOD isn't it always true ?QUESTIONMARK 
heart is what drives us and determines our fate .PERIOD 
that is what i need for my characters in my books :COLON a passionate heart .PERIOD 
i need mavericks ,COMMA dissidents ,COMMA adventurers ,COMMA outsiders and rebels ,COMMA who ask questions ,COMMA bend the rules and take risks .PERIOD 
people like all of you in this room .PERIOD 
nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters .PERIOD 
they only make good former spouses .PERIOD 
in the green room of the stadium ,COMMA i met the other flag bearers :COLON three athletes ,COMMA and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA two women with passionate hearts :COLON wangari maathai ,COMMA the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted <NUM> million trees .PERIOD and by doing so ,COMMA she has changed the soil ,COMMA the weather ,COMMA in some places in africa ,COMMA and of course the economic conditions in many villages .PERIOD 
and somaly mam ,COMMA a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution .PERIOD 
when she was <NUM> years old ,COMMA her grandfather sold her to a brothel .PERIOD 
she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from aids .PERIOD 
and of brothels where children are forced to receive five ,COMMA <NUM> clients per day ,COMMA and if they rebel ,COMMA they are tortured with electricity .PERIOD 
in the green room i received my uniform .PERIOD 
it was not the kind of outfit that i normally wear ,COMMA but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated .PERIOD not bad ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
i looked like a refrigerator .PERIOD 
but so did most of the flag-bearers ,COMMA except sophia loren ,COMMA the universal symbol of beauty and passion .PERIOD 
sophia is over <NUM> and she looks great .PERIOD 
she's sexy ,COMMA slim and tall ,COMMA with a deep tan .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ?QUESTIONMARK 
i don't know .PERIOD 
she replied ,COMMA posture .PERIOD my back is always straight ,COMMA and i don't make old people's noises .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth .PERIOD 
no grunting ,COMMA no coughing ,COMMA no wheezing ,COMMA no talking to yourselves ,COMMA no farting .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA she didn't say that exactly .PERIOD 
at some point around midnight ,COMMA we were summoned to the wings of the stadium ,COMMA and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag ,COMMA and the music started -- by the way ,COMMA the same music that starts here ,COMMA the aida march .PERIOD 
she walked elegantly ,COMMA like a giraffe on the african savannah ,COMMA holding the flag on her shoulder .PERIOD i jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm ,COMMA so that my head was actually under the damn flag .PERIOD 
all the cameras were ,COMMA of course ,COMMA on sophia .PERIOD 
that was fortunate for me ,COMMA because in most press photos i appear too ,COMMA although often between sophia's legs .PERIOD 
a place where most men would love to be .PERIOD 
the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium .PERIOD 
my husband is offended when i say this -- although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he shouldn't take it personally .PERIOD 
i have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes ,COMMA because i don't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells .PERIOD 
i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics -- passion .PERIOD 
so here's a tale of passion .PERIOD 
the year is <NUM> ,COMMA the place is a prison camp for tutsi refugees in congo .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA <NUM> percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls .PERIOD 
we can call this place in congo a death camp ,COMMA because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation .PERIOD 
the protagonists of this story are a young woman ,COMMA rose mapendo ,COMMA and her children .PERIOD 
she's pregnant and a widow .PERIOD 
soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed .PERIOD 
two tiny little boys .PERIOD 
she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick ,COMMA and ties it with her own hair .PERIOD 
she names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor ,COMMA and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them .PERIOD 
when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter ,COMMA she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go ,COMMA even when they hold a gun to her head .PERIOD 
mapendo ,COMMA in swahili ,COMMA means great love .PERIOD 
the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo .PERIOD 
i don't make them up .PERIOD there's no need for that .PERIOD 
i look around and i see them everywhere .PERIOD 
i have worked with women and for women all my life .PERIOD 
i know them well .PERIOD 
i was born in ancient times ,COMMA at the end of the world ,COMMA in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family .PERIOD 
no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached chile yet ,COMMA so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me .PERIOD 
i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom ,COMMA and for questioning the patriarchy .PERIOD 
but i was happy to pay it ,COMMA because for every blow that i received ,COMMA i was able to deliver two .PERIOD 
we had a memorable fight .PERIOD feminism is dated ?QUESTIONMARK 
they have no control over their bodies or their lives .PERIOD 
they have no education and no freedom .PERIOD 
they are raped ,COMMA beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity .PERIOD 
for most western young women of today ,COMMA being called a feminist is an insult .PERIOD 
feminism has never been sexy ,COMMA but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting ,COMMA and i have seldom suffered from lack of men .PERIOD 
feminism is not dead ,COMMA by no means .PERIOD 
it has evolved .PERIOD if you don't like the term ,COMMA change it ,COMMA for goddess' sake .PERIOD 
call it aphrodite ,COMMA or venus ,COMMA or bimbo ,COMMA or whatever you want ;SEMICOLON the name doesn't matter ,COMMA as long as we understand what it is about ,COMMA and we support it .PERIOD 
so here's another tale of passion ,COMMA and this is a sad one .PERIOD 
the year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation .PERIOD 
she's prepared to clean teeth ,COMMA but when she gets there ,COMMA she finds out that there are no doctors ,COMMA no dentists ,COMMA and the clinic is just a hut full of flies .PERIOD 
outside ,COMMA there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated .PERIOD 
the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars .PERIOD 
jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .PERIOD 
she risks a lot and she's terrified .PERIOD 
she doesn't even have the proper instruments ,COMMA but fortunately she has brought some novocaine .PERIOD 
jenny has a brave and passionate heart .PERIOD 
she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation .PERIOD 
at the end ,COMMA the relieved patient kisses her hands .PERIOD 
that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth .PERIOD 
the next morning ,COMMA when she comes again to the so-called clinic ,COMMA her first patient is waiting for her with her husband .PERIOD 
the husband ,COMMA furious ,COMMA threatens to kill the american .PERIOD 
the day before ,COMMA her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him .PERIOD 
millions of women live like this today .PERIOD 
they are the poorest of the poor .PERIOD 
although women do two-thirds of the world's labor ,COMMA they own less than one percent of the world's assets .PERIOD 
it is a fact that giving women education ,COMMA work ,COMMA the ability to control their own income ,COMMA inherit and own property ,COMMA benefits the society .PERIOD 
if a woman is empowered ,COMMA her children and her family will be better off .PERIOD 
if families prosper ,COMMA the village prospers ,COMMA and eventually so does the whole country .PERIOD 
wangari maathai goes to a village in kenya .PERIOD 
she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees .PERIOD 
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them ,COMMA drop by drop .PERIOD 
in a matter of five or six years ,COMMA they have a forest ,COMMA the soil is enriched ,COMMA and the village is saved .PERIOD 
the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down .PERIOD 
yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy .PERIOD 
for every dollar given to a women's program ,COMMA <NUM> dollars are given to men's programs .PERIOD 
women are <NUM> percent of humankind .PERIOD 
empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment .PERIOD 
i can promise you that women working together -- linked ,COMMA informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet .PERIOD 
men run the world ,COMMA and look at the mess we have .PERIOD 
what kind of world do we want ?QUESTIONMARK 
this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking .PERIOD 
does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ?QUESTIONMARK 
we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody ,COMMA not only for the privileged .PERIOD 
in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero's paintings at the uc berkeley library .PERIOD 
no museum or gallery in the united states ,COMMA except for the new york gallery that carries botero's work ,COMMA has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison .PERIOD 
they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power ,COMMA in the voluminous botero style .PERIOD 
i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart .PERIOD 
what i fear most is power with impunity .PERIOD 
i fear abuse of power ,COMMA and the power to abuse .PERIOD 
in our species ,COMMA the alpha males define reality ,COMMA and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules .PERIOD 
the rules change all the time ,COMMA but they always benefit them ,COMMA and in this case ,COMMA the trickle-down effect ,COMMA which does not work in economics ,COMMA works perfectly .PERIOD 
abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom .PERIOD 
women and children ,COMMA especially the poor ,COMMA are at the bottom .PERIOD 
even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child .PERIOD 
i'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender ,COMMA income ,COMMA race ,COMMA and class .PERIOD 
i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization .PERIOD 
but for real change ,COMMA we need feminine energy in the management of the world .PERIOD 
we need a critical number of women in positions of power ,COMMA and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men .PERIOD 
old guys are hopeless ;SEMICOLON we have to wait for them to die off .PERIOD 
yes ,COMMA i would love to have sophia loren's long legs and legendary breasts .PERIOD 
but given a choice ,COMMA i would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maathai ,COMMA somaly mam ,COMMA jenny and rose mapendo .PERIOD 
i want to make this world good .PERIOD 
not better ,COMMA but to make it good .PERIOD 
why not ?QUESTIONMARK it is possible .PERIOD look around in this room -- all this knowledge ,COMMA energy ,COMMA talent and technology .PERIOD 
let's get off our fannies ,COMMA roll up our sleeves and get to work ,COMMA passionately ,COMMA in creating an almost perfect world .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
how do you feed a city ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's one of the great questions of our time .PERIOD 
yet it's one that's rarely asked .PERIOD 
we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant ,COMMA or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time ,COMMA there is going to be food there waiting for us ,COMMA having magically come from somewhere .PERIOD 
but when you think that every day for a city the size of london ,COMMA enough food has to be produced ,COMMA transported ,COMMA bought and sold ,COMMA cooked ,COMMA eaten ,COMMA disposed of ,COMMA and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth ,COMMA it's remarkable that cities get fed at all .PERIOD 
we live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world ,COMMA forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat ,COMMA we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were .PERIOD 
and as more of us move into cities ,COMMA more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us .PERIOD 
these are extraordinary landscapes ,COMMA but few of us ever get to see them .PERIOD 
and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .PERIOD 
as more of us move into cities ,COMMA more of us are eating meat ,COMMA so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals .PERIOD 
and given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first ,COMMA that's not a very efficient way of feeding us .PERIOD 
and it's an escalating problem too .PERIOD 
by <NUM> ,COMMA it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities .PERIOD 
and it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .PERIOD 
so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .PERIOD 
and that's going to pose an enormous problem .PERIOD 
that's a big problem .PERIOD and actually if we carry on as we are ,COMMA it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve .PERIOD 
nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .PERIOD 
although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .PERIOD 
we're very hungry for fossil fuels too .PERIOD 
it takes about <NUM> calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west .PERIOD 
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost ,COMMA we don't actually value it .PERIOD 
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away .PERIOD 
and to end all of this ,COMMA at the end of this long process ,COMMA we're not even managing to feed the planet properly .PERIOD 
a billion of us are obese ,COMMA while a further billion starve .PERIOD 
none of it makes very much sense .PERIOD 
as we're moving into cities ,COMMA the world is also embracing a western diet .PERIOD 
and if we look to the future ,COMMA it's an unsustainable diet .PERIOD 
so how did we get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
and more importantly ,COMMA what are we going to do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA to answer the slightly easier question first ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA i would say ,COMMA is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east ,COMMA known as the fertile crescent .PERIOD 
because ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it was crescent shaped .PERIOD 
and it was also fertile .PERIOD 
and it was here ,COMMA about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that two extraordinary inventions ,COMMA agriculture and urbanism ,COMMA happened roughly in the same place and at the same time .PERIOD 
this is no accident ,COMMA because agriculture and cities are bound together .PERIOD they need each other .PERIOD 
because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements .PERIOD 
and if we look at what those settlements were like ,COMMA we see they were compact .PERIOD 
they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur ,COMMA that were ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA spiritualized ,COMMA central food distribution centers .PERIOD 
because it was the temples that organized the harvest ,COMMA gathered in the grain ,COMMA offered it to the gods ,COMMA and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them .PERIOD 
and in fact ,COMMA that's true of every ancient city .PERIOD 
but of course not all of them were that small .PERIOD 
famously ,COMMA rome had about a million citizens by the first century ad .PERIOD 
so how did a city like this feed itself ?QUESTIONMARK 
the answer is what i call ancient food miles .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA rome had access to the sea ,COMMA which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .PERIOD 
this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world ,COMMA because it was very difficult to transport food over roads ,COMMA which were rough .PERIOD 
and the food obviously went off very quickly .PERIOD 
so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long ,COMMA drawn out militarized shopping spree ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
in fact -- i love the fact ,COMMA i just have to mention this :COLON rome in fact used to import oysters from london ,COMMA at one stage .PERIOD i think that's extraordinary .PERIOD 
so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .PERIOD 
but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .PERIOD 
if we look at a map of london in the 17th century ,COMMA we can see that its grain ,COMMA which is coming in from the thames ,COMMA along the bottom of this map .PERIOD 
and the roads leading up from them to cheapside ,COMMA which was the main market ,COMMA were also grain markets .PERIOD 
and if you look at the name of one of those streets ,COMMA bread street ,COMMA you can tell what was going on there <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
and the same of course was true for fish .PERIOD 
fish was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA coming in by river as well .PERIOD same thing .PERIOD 
and of course billingsgate ,COMMA famously ,COMMA was london's fish market ,COMMA operating on-site here until the mid-1980s .PERIOD 
which is extraordinary ,COMMA really ,COMMA when you think about it .PERIOD 
everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .PERIOD 
this is another thing about food in cities :COLON once its roots into the city are established ,COMMA they very rarely move .PERIOD 
meat is a very different story because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA animals could walk into the city .PERIOD 
so much of london's meat was coming from the northwest ,COMMA from scotland and wales .PERIOD 
so it was coming in ,COMMA and arriving at the city at the northwest ,COMMA which is why smithfield ,COMMA london's very famous meat market ,COMMA was located up there .PERIOD 
poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on ,COMMA to the northeast .PERIOD 
i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .PERIOD 
and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside ,COMMA that's where they were sold ,COMMA which is why it's called poultry .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age ,COMMA you can trace food coming in to it .PERIOD 
you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food ,COMMA both by reading the names of the streets ,COMMA which give you a lot of clues .PERIOD 
friday street ,COMMA in a previous life ,COMMA is where you went to buy your fish on a friday .PERIOD 
because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA if you were having sunday lunch ,COMMA the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier .PERIOD 
so this was obviously an organic city ,COMMA part of an organic cycle .PERIOD 
and then <NUM> years later everything changed .PERIOD 
this is an image of the great western in <NUM> .PERIOD 
and as you can see ,COMMA some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep .PERIOD 
so all of a sudden ,COMMA these animals are no longer walking into market .PERIOD 
they're being slaughtered out of sight and mind ,COMMA somewhere in the countryside .PERIOD 
and they're coming into the city by rail .PERIOD 
and this changes everything .PERIOD 
to start off with ,COMMA it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities ,COMMA really any size and shape ,COMMA in any place .PERIOD 
cities used to be constrained by geography ;SEMICOLON they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means .PERIOD 
all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .PERIOD 
and as you can see from these maps of london ,COMMA in the <NUM> years after the trains came ,COMMA it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA to a large splurge ,COMMA that would be very ,COMMA very difficult to feed with anybody on foot ,COMMA either animals or people .PERIOD 
and of course that was just the beginning .PERIOD after the trains came cars ,COMMA and really this marks the end of this process .PERIOD 
it's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .PERIOD 
and this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell ,COMMA devoid of mess ,COMMA certainly devoid of people ,COMMA because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA what they did to get food was they got in their cars ,COMMA drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts ,COMMA came back with a week's worth of shopping ,COMMA and wondered what on earth to do with it .PERIOD 
and this really is the moment when our relationship ,COMMA both with food and cities ,COMMA changes completely .PERIOD 
here we have food -- that used to be the center ,COMMA the social core of the city -- at the periphery .PERIOD 
it used to be a social event ,COMMA buying and selling food .PERIOD 
now it's anonymous .PERIOD 
we used to cook ;SEMICOLON now we just add water ,COMMA or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something .PERIOD 
we don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat .PERIOD 
we just read the back of a label on a packet .PERIOD 
and we don't value food .PERIOD we don't trust it .PERIOD 
so instead of trusting it ,COMMA we fear it .PERIOD 
and instead of valuing it ,COMMA we throw it away .PERIOD 
one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .PERIOD 
by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place ,COMMA they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship ,COMMA which is that of us and nature .PERIOD 
and also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver ,COMMA that ,COMMA as we've seen ,COMMA are unsustainable .PERIOD 
so what are we going to do about that ?QUESTIONMARK 
it's not a new question .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago it's what thomas more was asking himself .PERIOD 
this is the frontispiece of his book utopia .PERIOD 
and it was a series of semi-independent city-states ,COMMA if that sounds remotely familiar ,COMMA a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad ,COMMA and grew vegetables in their back gardens ,COMMA and ate communal meals together ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia ,COMMA even though more never framed it that way .PERIOD 
and here is another very famous utopian vision ,COMMA that of ebenezer howard ,COMMA the garden city .PERIOD 
same idea :COLON series of semi-independent city-states ,COMMA little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around ,COMMA joined to one another by railway .PERIOD 
and again ,COMMA food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision .PERIOD 
and that is the problem with these utopian ideas ,COMMA that they are utopian .PERIOD 
utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately .PERIOD 
it was a kind of joke ,COMMA because it's got a double derivation from the greek .PERIOD 
it can either mean a good place ,COMMA or no place .PERIOD 
because it's an ideal .PERIOD it's an imaginary thing .PERIOD we can't have it .PERIOD 
and i think ,COMMA as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling ,COMMA that makes it not much use .PERIOD 
we live in a world shaped by food ,COMMA and if we realize that ,COMMA we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool ,COMMA design tool ,COMMA to shape the world differently .PERIOD 
well i think it looks a bit like this .PERIOD 
i have to use this slide .PERIOD it's just the look on the face of the dog .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA this is -- it's food at the center of life ,COMMA at the center of family life ,COMMA being celebrated ,COMMA being enjoyed ,COMMA people taking time for it .PERIOD 
this is where food should be in our society .PERIOD 
but you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this .PERIOD 
by the way ,COMMA these can be men as well .PERIOD 
it's people who think about food ,COMMA who think ahead ,COMMA who plan ,COMMA who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them .PERIOD 
we need these people .PERIOD we're part of a network .PERIOD 
here ,COMMA i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .PERIOD 
but networks ,COMMA markets where food is being grown locally .PERIOD 
it's common .PERIOD it's fresh .PERIOD 
it's part of the social life of the city .PERIOD 
because without that ,COMMA you can't have this kind of place ,COMMA food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape ,COMMA and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .PERIOD 
cows with a view .PERIOD 
steaming piles of humus .PERIOD 
this is basically bringing the whole thing together .PERIOD 
and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto .PERIOD 
it's a greenhouse ,COMMA where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .PERIOD 
here is a plant called kevin ,COMMA or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called kevin .PERIOD i don't know .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important .PERIOD 
so sitopia ,COMMA for me ,COMMA is really a way of seeing .PERIOD 
it's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere .PERIOD 
the trick is to join them up ,COMMA to use food as a way of seeing .PERIOD 
and if we do that ,COMMA we're going to stop seeing cities as big ,COMMA metropolitan ,COMMA unproductive blobs ,COMMA like this .PERIOD 
we're going to see them more like this ,COMMA as part of the productive ,COMMA organic framework of which they are inevitably a part ,COMMA symbiotically connected .PERIOD 
but of course ,COMMA that's not a great image either ,COMMA because we need not to be producing food like this anymore .PERIOD 
we need to be thinking more about permaculture ,COMMA which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .PERIOD 
it's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .PERIOD 
the best image i know of this is from <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
it's ambrogio lorenzetti's allegory of good government .PERIOD 
it's about the relationship between the city and the countryside .PERIOD 
and i think the message of this is very clear .PERIOD 
if the city looks after the country ,COMMA the country will look after the city .PERIOD 
and i want us to ask now ,COMMA what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?QUESTIONMARK 
what would an allegory of good government look like today ?QUESTIONMARK 
because i think it's an urgent question .PERIOD 
it's one we have to ask ,COMMA and we have to start answering .PERIOD 
we know we are what we eat .PERIOD 
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .PERIOD 
but if we take that idea ,COMMA we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
for years i've been feeling frustrated ,COMMA because as a religious historian ,COMMA i've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths .PERIOD 
every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the golden rule .PERIOD 
sometimes it comes in a positive version -- always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself .PERIOD 
look into your own heart ,COMMA discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse ,COMMA under any circumstance whatsoever ,COMMA to inflict that pain on anybody else .PERIOD 
and people have emphasized the importance of compassion ,COMMA not just because it sounds good ,COMMA but because it works .PERIOD 
people have found that when they have implemented the golden rule as confucius said ,COMMA all day and every day ,COMMA not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism ,COMMA but to do it all day and every day ,COMMA you dethrone yourself from the center of your world ,COMMA put another there ,COMMA and you transcend yourself .PERIOD 
and it brings you into the presence of what's been called god ,COMMA nirvana ,COMMA rama ,COMMA tao .PERIOD 
something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence .PERIOD 
but you know you'd never know it a lot of the time ,COMMA that this was so central to the religious life .PERIOD 
because with a few wonderful exceptions ,COMMA very often when religious people come together ,COMMA religious leaders come together ,COMMA they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort .PERIOD 
often people don't really want to be compassionate .PERIOD 
and that of course defeats the object of the exercise .PERIOD 
now why was i so grateful to ted ?QUESTIONMARK 
because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century ,COMMA enabling me to speak to a much ,COMMA much wider audience than i could have ever conceived .PERIOD 
because i feel an urgency about this .PERIOD 
if we don't manage to implement the golden rule globally ,COMMA so that we treat all peoples ,COMMA wherever and whoever they may be ,COMMA as though they were as important as ourselves ,COMMA i doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation .PERIOD 
the task of our time ,COMMA one of the great tasks of our time ,COMMA is to build a global society ,COMMA as i said ,COMMA where people can live together in peace .PERIOD 
and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem .PERIOD 
and of course it's not just religious people who believe in the golden rule .PERIOD 
this is the source of all morality ,COMMA this imaginative act of empathy ,COMMA putting yourself in the place of another .PERIOD 
we can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith ,COMMA or we can go back to the rabbis .PERIOD rabbi hillel ,COMMA the older contemporary of jesus ,COMMA who ,COMMA when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg ,COMMA said ,COMMA that which is hateful to you ,COMMA do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD 
that is the torah and everything else is only commentary .PERIOD 
and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate .PERIOD 
and we need to revive that spirit .PERIOD 
and it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down .PERIOD 
we have to make this happen ,COMMA and we can do it with the modern communications that ted has introduced .PERIOD 
already i've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners .PERIOD 
in singapore ,COMMA we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in singaporean society ,COMMA and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically .PERIOD 
in malaysia ,COMMA there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people ,COMMA young people ,COMMA and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art .PERIOD 
throughout europe ,COMMA the muslim communities are holding events and discussions ,COMMA are discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths .PERIOD 
but it can't stop there .PERIOD it can't stop with the launch .PERIOD 
religious teaching ,COMMA this is where we've gone so wrong ,COMMA concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines .PERIOD 
religious teaching must always lead to action .PERIOD 
and i intend to work on this till my dying day .PERIOD 
and i want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking .PERIOD 
education because we've so dropped out of compassion .PERIOD 
people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody .PERIOD 
but of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it .PERIOD 
you also have to do it .PERIOD 
i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people ,COMMA which are dividing us from one another .PERIOD 
the same applies to educators .PERIOD 
i'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism ,COMMA the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle .PERIOD 
i'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions .PERIOD 
and perhaps above all ,COMMA to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking ,COMMA so that because people have this charter ,COMMA whatever their beliefs or lack of them ,COMMA they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech ,COMMA disdainful remarks from their religious leaders ,COMMA their political leaders ,COMMA from the captains of industry .PERIOD 
because we can change the world ,COMMA we have the ability .PERIOD 
i would never have thought of putting the charter online .PERIOD 
i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement .PERIOD 
and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas .PERIOD 
because that is what is so wonderful about ted .PERIOD 
and of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable .PERIOD 
but i'd just like to quote ,COMMA finish at the end with a reference to a british author ,COMMA an oxford author whom i don't quote very often ,COMMA cs .PERIOD lewis .PERIOD 
but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl .PERIOD 
it's in his book the four loves .PERIOD 
he said that he distinguished between erotic love ,COMMA when two people gaze ,COMMA spellbound ,COMMA into each other's eyes .PERIOD 
and then he compared that to friendship ,COMMA when two people stand side by side ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA shoulder to shoulder ,COMMA with their eyes fixed on a common goal .PERIOD 
we don't have to fall in love with each other ,COMMA but we can become friends .PERIOD 
and i am convinced .PERIOD 
i felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at vevey ,COMMA that when people of all different persuasions come together ,COMMA working side by side for a common goal ,COMMA differences melt away .PERIOD 
and we learn amity .PERIOD 
and we learn to live together and to get to know one another .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
i draw to better understand things .PERIOD 
sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still don't understand what it is i'm drawing .PERIOD 
those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for the way things work ,COMMA while preparing for part of a panel for called understanding ,COMMA spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new cd burner .PERIOD 
i've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions ,COMMA but i did finally figure it out .PERIOD i had to figure it out ,COMMA because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector ,COMMA so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i could talk about something that i'm known for ,COMMA something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here ,COMMA or i could talk about something i really care about .PERIOD 
i decided to go with the latter .PERIOD 
i'm going to talk about rome .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i went to rhode island school of design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture .PERIOD 
i was lucky enough to spend my last year ,COMMA my fifth year ,COMMA in rome as a student .PERIOD it changed my life .PERIOD 
not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home ,COMMA driving into risd everyday ,COMMA driving back .PERIOD 
i missed the '60s .PERIOD i read about them ;SEMICOLON i understand they were pretty interesting .PERIOD i missed them ,COMMA but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome ,COMMA and it's a place that is never far from my mind .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA whenever given an opportunity ,COMMA i try to do something in it or with it or for it .PERIOD 
i also make drawings to help people understand things .PERIOD 
things that i want them to believe i understand .PERIOD 
and that's what i do as an illustrator ,COMMA that's my job .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA i'm going to show you some pictures of rome .PERIOD 
i've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years .PERIOD 
all different materials ,COMMA all different styles ,COMMA all different times ,COMMA drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of rome .PERIOD 
part of the reason i'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process i go through of trying to figure out what it is i feel about rome and why i feel it .PERIOD 
rome is a city full of surprises .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we're talking about unusual perspectives ,COMMA we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast ,COMMA sun-drenched piazzas -- never ,COMMA though ,COMMA piazzas that are not humanly scaled .PERIOD 
part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically .PERIOD 
that amazing juxtaposition of old and new ,COMMA the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets .PERIOD 
and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form .PERIOD 
how could i share my sense of rome ,COMMA my understanding of rome ?QUESTIONMARK 
and i'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you're not quite sure where you're going ,COMMA you're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency .PERIOD 
and here's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page .PERIOD 
here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways .PERIOD 
maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this .PERIOD 
maybe i should get away from this map completely ,COMMA and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things .PERIOD and i'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits .PERIOD 
that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot .PERIOD 
but even though i just started this presentation ,COMMA this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate .PERIOD 
eventually ,COMMA i realized that i had really no content that i could count on ,COMMA so i decided to move towards packaging .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA it seems to work for a lot of things .PERIOD 
so i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick .PERIOD 
but one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of rome .PERIOD 
sort of an overview of rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible .PERIOD 
quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter ,COMMA and very slow walking through rome ,COMMA you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across .PERIOD 
anyways ,COMMA i went back to the dirigible notion .PERIOD 
went to alberto santos-dumont .PERIOD 
found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with some of the things in rome .PERIOD 
this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of ,COMMA but it would be like having a ruler -- sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler .PERIOD 
not that you know how long number <NUM> actually is ,COMMA but you would be able to compare number <NUM> against the pantheon with number <NUM> against the baths of caracalla ,COMMA and so on and so forth .PERIOD if you were interested .PERIOD 
this is beatrix .PERIOD she has a dog named ajax ,COMMA she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible -- she's assembling the structure ,COMMA ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off .PERIOD 
she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city .PERIOD 
a nice way to show that river ,COMMA that stream sort of pouring down the hill .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius ,COMMA and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius -- gets a little too close ,COMMA nudges it .PERIOD 
this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius ,COMMA which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters .PERIOD over the piazza of saint ignacio ,COMMA completely ruining the symmetry ,COMMA but that aside a spectacular place to visit .PERIOD 
a spectacular framework ,COMMA inside of which you see ,COMMA usually ,COMMA extraordinary blue sky .PERIOD 
over the pantheon and the 26-foot diameter oculus .PERIOD 
unfortunately for her ,COMMA the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon ,COMMA and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome ,COMMA which would ,COMMA from their point of view ,COMMA naturally be hanging upside down .PERIOD 
they bail out as soon as they get to the top of saint ivo ,COMMA that little spiral structure you see there .PERIOD 
she continues on her way over piazza navona .PERIOD 
notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant ,COMMA is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry .PERIOD 
they keep on motoring towards the campo de' fiori ,COMMA which they soon reach .PERIOD ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace ,COMMA which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon ,COMMA and then is completely removed and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning .PERIOD 
anyway ,COMMA the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto ,COMMA ajax makes a lunge for it .PERIOD 
she's managed to save the prosciutto ,COMMA but in the process she loses the tablecloth ,COMMA which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner .PERIOD 
they continue without their tablecloth ,COMMA looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch .PERIOD 
they eventually discover a huge wall that's filled with small holes ,COMMA ideal for docking a dirigible because you've got a place to tie up .PERIOD 
turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the coliseum ,COMMA so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view .PERIOD 
at the end of lunch ,COMMA they untie the anchor ,COMMA they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius ,COMMA which has this lightning rod on top .PERIOD 
unfortunately ,COMMA that's a problem :COLON they get a little too close ,COMMA and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes .PERIOD 
so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion .PERIOD 
marcello ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA is sort of a lazy guy ,COMMA but he's not due at work until about noon .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the alarm goes off and it's five to <NUM> or so .PERIOD 
he gets up ,COMMA leaps onto his scooter ,COMMA races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace ,COMMA down the alleys ,COMMA through the streets that tourists may be wandering through ,COMMA disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn .PERIOD 
that speed with which he is moving ,COMMA i hope i have suggested in this little image ,COMMA which ,COMMA again ,COMMA can be turned around and read from both sides because there's text on the bottom and text on the top ,COMMA one of which is upside down in this image .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA he keeps on moving ,COMMA approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street .PERIOD 
waiter catches on ,COMMA but it's too late .PERIOD 
and marcello keeps moving in his scooter .PERIOD 
removes some scaffolding .PERIOD one of the reasons rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric ,COMMA it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself ,COMMA or we find it .PERIOD 
right through the piazza della rotonda ,COMMA in front of the pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work .PERIOD 
marcello ,COMMA as it turns out ,COMMA is the driver of the number <NUM> bus ,COMMA and if you've been on the number <NUM> bus ,COMMA you know that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marcello demonstrated on his scooter .PERIOD 
and finally carletto .PERIOD you see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner .PERIOD 
he's looking at his table ;SEMICOLON he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of <NUM> years ,COMMA and he wants it to be perfect .PERIOD 
he's got candles out ,COMMA he's got flowers in the middle and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses .PERIOD 
but he's not happy ;SEMICOLON something's wrong .PERIOD 
the phone rings anyway ,COMMA he's called to the palazzo .PERIOD 
he saunters -- he saunters at a good clip ,COMMA but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen ,COMMA he's sauntering .PERIOD 
everybody knows carletto ,COMMA because he's in entertainment ,COMMA actually ;SEMICOLON he's in television .PERIOD 
he's actually in television repair ,COMMA which is why people know him .PERIOD 
so they all have his number .PERIOD 
he arrives at the palazzo ,COMMA arrives at the big front door .PERIOD 
enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian ,COMMA who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo ;SEMICOLON nobody's tvs are working and there's a big soccer game coming up ,COMMA and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous .PERIOD 
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring ,COMMA and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building ,COMMA apartment by apartment ,COMMA checking every television ,COMMA checking every connection ,COMMA hoping to find out what this problem is .PERIOD 
he works his way up ,COMMA finally ,COMMA the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic .PERIOD 
he opens the window of the attic ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and there's a tablecloth wrapped around the building's television antenna .PERIOD 
he removes it ,COMMA the problems are solved ,COMMA everybody in the palazzo is happy .PERIOD 
and of course ,COMMA he also solves his own problem .PERIOD 
all he has to do now ,COMMA with a perfect table ,COMMA is wait for her to arrive .PERIOD 
that was the first attempt ,COMMA but it didn't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome .PERIOD 
so i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA i'll just do piazzas ,COMMA and i'll get inside and underneath and i'll show these things growing and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on .PERIOD 
and then i thought ,COMMA that's too complicated .PERIOD no ,COMMA i'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i'll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale ,COMMA so you can see the top of sant'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space .PERIOD 
now that's one drawing ,COMMA so i thought maybe it's time for piranesi to meet escher .PERIOD 
you see that i'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope .PERIOD 
there's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together .PERIOD 
a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information ,COMMA it's a series of layers .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA you always peel one layer off another ;SEMICOLON we think of them as pages ,COMMA doing it a certain way .PERIOD 
but think of them as layers .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers ,COMMA vertical layers -- and i thought ,COMMA well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if i got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers .PERIOD 
the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars ;SEMICOLON the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down .PERIOD 
you can see that in <NUM> ,COMMA it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever .PERIOD 
adaptations all get buried under the stucco .PERIOD 
i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it .PERIOD 
but more importantly ,COMMA i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks ,COMMA or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco ,COMMA which is more often the case .PERIOD 
so it becomes slightly three-dimensional .PERIOD 
i could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold -- double foldout page -- which ,COMMA if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child ,COMMA you hopefully stick your head into .PERIOD 
you wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time .PERIOD 
and i've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages .PERIOD 
but then i thought ,COMMA maybe i could be simpler here .PERIOD 
let's look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it .PERIOD 
here's a book completely wide open .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA if i don't open the book the whole way ,COMMA if i just open it <NUM> degrees ,COMMA we're looking down the front of the pantheon ,COMMA and we're looking sort of at the top ,COMMA more or less down on the square .PERIOD 
and if i turn the book the other way ,COMMA we're looking across the square at the front of the pantheon .PERIOD 
no foldouts ,COMMA no tricks -- just a book that isn't open the whole way .PERIOD 
that seemed promising .PERIOD i thought ,COMMA maybe i'll do it inside and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book .PERIOD 
so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA maybe i'm on the right track ,COMMA but it sort of lost its human quality .PERIOD 
so i went back to the notion of story ,COMMA which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way .PERIOD 
if it was a homing pigeon ,COMMA it would be called homer's odyssey .PERIOD 
but it was the journey of the . .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA if a title works ,COMMA use it .PERIOD but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome .PERIOD 
it's a pigeon sitting on top of a church .PERIOD 
goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff .PERIOD comes back ,COMMA the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there's no way this pigeon can get home .PERIOD 
so it's a homeless pigeon now and it's going to have to find another place to live ,COMMA and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things ,COMMA and we start with the tall ones and so on .PERIOD 
maybe it has to go back and live with family members ;SEMICOLON that's not always a good thing ,COMMA but it does sort of bring pigeons together again .PERIOD 
and i thought ,COMMA that's sort of interesting ,COMMA but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way .PERIOD 
so i kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons .PERIOD 
he'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot -- and they become really friends with this guy ,COMMA and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that .PERIOD 
there's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons .PERIOD 
but unfortunately he gets sick .PERIOD he gets really sick at the end of the story .PERIOD 
he's taught them to spell his name ,COMMA which is aldo .PERIOD 
they show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him -- he lives in this little garret -- and they spell his name and fly around .PERIOD 
and he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof ,COMMA and all the pigeons ,COMMA a la red balloon ,COMMA are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city .PERIOD 
and i forgot to mention this :COLON whenever he lost a pigeon ,COMMA he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city .PERIOD 
in the old roman custom ,COMMA the dead were never buried within the walls .PERIOD 
and i thought that's a really cheery story .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD that's really going to go a long way .PERIOD 
so anyway ,COMMA i went through . .PERIOD and again ,COMMA if packaging doesn't work and if the stories aren't going anywhere ,COMMA i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction .PERIOD 
and sometimes it does focus me enough and i'll even do a title page .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on ,COMMA which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of rome -- to someone in the city .PERIOD 
and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here .PERIOD 
if you see the red line ,COMMA you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ;SEMICOLON if you don't see the red line ,COMMA you are the pigeon .PERIOD 
and it becomes necessary and possible ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving .PERIOD 
past the pyramid of cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you ,COMMA even if you haven't been to rome recently -- past the gatehouse .PERIOD 
this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do :COLON it takes the scenic route ,COMMA which was a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA we circle around the coliseum ,COMMA past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river .PERIOD 
we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese -- designed by michelangelo ,COMMA built of stone taken from the coliseum -- narrow escape .PERIOD 
we swoop down over the campo de' fiori .PERIOD 
the only rule of perspective that i think matters is if it looks believable ,COMMA you've succeeded .PERIOD 
but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here ;SEMICOLON a couple are on mars and a couple of others in cremona .PERIOD 
but into the piazza in front of santa maria della pace ,COMMA where invariably a soccer game is going on ,COMMA and we're hit by a soccer ball .PERIOD 
now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball .PERIOD 
and if you do want to see santa maria della pace ,COMMA these books are really flexible ,COMMA incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way .PERIOD 
through the alley ,COMMA we can see the impact is captured in the red line .PERIOD 
and then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of sant'agnese and around the dome looking down into piazza navona -- which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times ;SEMICOLON there's the bernini statue of the four rivers -- and then past the wonderful borromini sant'ivo ,COMMA stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch our breath .PERIOD 
and then we can swoop inside and around ;SEMICOLON and because we're flying ,COMMA we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time ,COMMA so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page .PERIOD 
we get a little exuberant as we pass gesu ;SEMICOLON it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way .PERIOD 
past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about ;SEMICOLON beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon ristorante sign ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
and eventually ,COMMA we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo ,COMMA which is our destination .PERIOD 
straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic ,COMMA where somebody is working at the drawing board .PERIOD 
he removes the message from the leg of the bird ;SEMICOLON this is what it says .PERIOD 
as we look at the drawing board ,COMMA we see what he's working on is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken ,COMMA and the red line extends through all the sights .PERIOD 
and if you want the information ,COMMA so that we complete this cycle of understanding ,COMMA all you have to do is read these paragraphs .PERIOD 
today i'd like to show you the future of the way we make things .PERIOD 
i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling ,COMMA replicating and repairing themselves .PERIOD 
so i'm going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing ,COMMA and then compare that to some natural systems .PERIOD 
so in the current state of manufacturing ,COMMA we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time] ,COMMA <NUM> to a million parts ,COMMA fairly complex ,COMMA new ,COMMA exciting technologies in steel ,COMMA concrete ,COMMA glass .PERIOD 
we have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time] ,COMMA <NUM> million parts .PERIOD 
but on the other side ,COMMA if you look at the natural systems ,COMMA we have proteins that have two million types ,COMMA can fold in <NUM> nanoseconds ,COMMA or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour .PERIOD 
so there's all of this complexity in our natural systems ,COMMA but they're extremely efficient ,COMMA far more efficient than anything we can build ,COMMA far more complex than anything we can build .PERIOD 
they're far more efficient in terms of energy .PERIOD 
they hardly ever make mistakes .PERIOD 
and they can repair themselves for longevity .PERIOD 
and if we can translate that into our built environment ,COMMA then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things .PERIOD 
and i think the key to that is self-assembly .PERIOD 
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment ,COMMA i think there's four key factors .PERIOD 
the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines .PERIOD 
and we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the dna of how our buildings work .PERIOD 
then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up ,COMMA or reconfigure .PERIOD 
we need some energy that's going to allow that to activate ,COMMA allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program .PERIOD 
and we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want .PERIOD 
so i'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-assembling future .PERIOD 
so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- <NUM> ft ,COMMA <NUM> ft .PERIOD long proteins .PERIOD 
they're embedded with mechanical electrical devices ,COMMA sensors .PERIOD 
you decode what you want to fold up into ,COMMA into a sequence of angles -- so negative <NUM> ,COMMA negative <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA negative <NUM> -- something like that ;SEMICOLON so a sequence of angles ,COMMA or turns ,COMMA and you send that sequence through the string .PERIOD 
each unit takes its message -- so negative <NUM> -- it rotates to that ,COMMA checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor .PERIOD 
so these are the brilliant scientists ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA designers that worked on this project .PERIOD 
and i think it really brings to light :COLON is this really scalable ?QUESTIONMARK 
i mean ,COMMA thousands of dollars ,COMMA lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot .PERIOD 
can we really scale this up ?QUESTIONMARK can we really embed robotics into every part ?QUESTIONMARK 
the next one questions that and looks at passive nature ,COMMA or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability .PERIOD 
but it goes a step further ,COMMA and it tries to have actual computation .PERIOD 
it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing ,COMMA the digital logic gate ,COMMA directly into your parts .PERIOD 
so this is a nand gate .PERIOD 
you have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing ,COMMA and you have two input tetrahedrons .PERIOD 
the other one is from the previous brick that was placed .PERIOD 
and then it gives you an output in 3d space .PERIOD 
so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do .PERIOD 
it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .PERIOD 
and now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down .PERIOD 
so on the left-hand side ,COMMA [<NUM>] input equals <NUM> output ,COMMA which goes down .PERIOD 
on the right-hand side ,COMMA [<NUM>] input is a <NUM> output ,COMMA which goes up .PERIOD 
and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build .PERIOD 
so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed .PERIOD 
so that means that we can have some form of self-replication .PERIOD 
in this case i call it self-guided replication ,COMMA because your structure contains the exact blueprints .PERIOD 
if you have errors ,COMMA you can replace a part .PERIOD 
all the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it .PERIOD 
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .PERIOD 
it's directly embedded ;SEMICOLON there's no external instructions .PERIOD 
so the last project i'll show is called biased chains ,COMMA and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems .PERIOD 
so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system .PERIOD 
so basically you have a chain of elements .PERIOD 
each element is completely identical ,COMMA and they're biased .PERIOD 
so as you assemble the chain ,COMMA you're basically programming it .PERIOD 
so when you shake the chain ,COMMA it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case ,COMMA a spiral ,COMMA or in this case ,COMMA two cubes next to each other .PERIOD 
so what does this tell us about the future ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly ,COMMA replication ,COMMA repair in our physical structures ,COMMA our buildings ,COMMA machines .PERIOD 
there's new programmability in these parts .PERIOD 
and from that you have new possibilities for computing .PERIOD 
we'll have spatial computing .PERIOD 
imagine if our buildings ,COMMA our bridges ,COMMA machines ,COMMA all of our bricks could actually compute .PERIOD 
that's amazing parallel and distributed computing power ,COMMA new design possibilities .PERIOD 
so it's exciting potential for this .PERIOD 
so i think these projects i've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future ,COMMA if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
recently i visited beloit ,COMMA wisconsin .PERIOD 
and i was there to honor a great 20th century explorer ,COMMA roy chapman andrews .PERIOD 
during his time at the american museum of natural history ,COMMA andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions ,COMMA like here in the gobi desert .PERIOD 
he was quite a figure .PERIOD 
he was later ,COMMA it's said ,COMMA the basis of the indiana jones character .PERIOD 
and when i was in beloit ,COMMA wisconsin ,COMMA i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students .PERIOD 
and i'm here to tell you ,COMMA if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at ted ,COMMA it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture .PERIOD 
don't try that one .PERIOD 
there was a young girl who stood up ,COMMA and she asked the question :COLON where should we explore ?QUESTIONMARK 
i think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on earth is over ,COMMA that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore .PERIOD 
but is that really the case ?QUESTIONMARK 
is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth ?QUESTIONMARK 
it sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology .PERIOD 
this is an explorer of the unseen world ,COMMA martinus beijerinck .PERIOD 
so beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease .PERIOD 
what he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters .PERIOD 
he came up with a name for his mystery agent .PERIOD 
he called it the virus -- latin for poison .PERIOD 
and in uncovering viruses ,COMMA beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us .PERIOD 
we now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet ,COMMA more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined .PERIOD 
and obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox ,COMMA the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer ,COMMA which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus .PERIOD 
and beijerinck's discovery ,COMMA this was not something that occurred <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
it was a little over <NUM> years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses .PERIOD 
so basically we had automobiles ,COMMA but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .PERIOD 
we now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing ,COMMA which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species ,COMMA but to look at entire metagenomes ,COMMA the communities of teeming microorganisms in ,COMMA on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species .PERIOD 
we can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between .PERIOD 
in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them .PERIOD 
and just to give you a sense of how this works ,COMMA imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you .PERIOD 
and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza .PERIOD 
the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information .PERIOD 
and if we started looking into that genetic information ,COMMA we'd see a number of usual suspects out there -- of course ,COMMA a lot of human genetic information ,COMMA but also bacterial and viral information ,COMMA mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose .PERIOD 
but we'd also see something very ,COMMA very surprising .PERIOD 
basically we have no clue what this is .PERIOD 
and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data ,COMMA a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter .PERIOD 
we know it's not anything that we've seen before ;SEMICOLON it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information .PERIOD 
and there's a lot of it .PERIOD 
if you think <NUM> percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter ,COMMA if we looked at your gut ,COMMA up to <NUM> or <NUM> percent of that information is biological dark matter .PERIOD 
and even in the relatively sterile blood ,COMMA around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- can't be classified ,COMMA can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before .PERIOD 
at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .PERIOD 
these deep sequencing tools are relatively new .PERIOD 
but as they become more and more accurate ,COMMA we've determined that this information is a form of life ,COMMA or at least some of it is a form of life .PERIOD 
and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy ,COMMA there's a very ,COMMA very exciting possibility that exists :COLON that buried in this life ,COMMA in this genetic information ,COMMA are signatures of as of yet unidentified life .PERIOD 
that as we explore these strings of a's ,COMMA t's ,COMMA c's and g's ,COMMA we may uncover a completely new class of life that ,COMMA like beijerinck ,COMMA will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .PERIOD 
that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology .PERIOD 
i'm pleased to announce that ,COMMA along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf ,COMMA we're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life .PERIOD 
a little over a hundred years ago ,COMMA people were unaware of viruses ,COMMA the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .PERIOD 
a hundred years from now ,COMMA people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses .PERIOD 
it's true ,COMMA we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there ,COMMA but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on earth .PERIOD 
beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from beloit ,COMMA wisconsin .PERIOD 
and i think if we phrase that lesson ,COMMA it's something like this :COLON don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story .PERIOD 
go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore .PERIOD 
there are unknowns all around us and they're just waiting to be discovered .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
we've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising .PERIOD 
so i'll try and do that ,COMMA but i want to start with two things that everyone already knows .PERIOD 
and the first one ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is something that has been known for most of recorded history .PERIOD 
and that is that the planet earth ,COMMA or the solar system ,COMMA or our environment or whatever ,COMMA is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation ,COMMA as it used to be thought -- and our present existence ,COMMA and most important ,COMMA our future survival .PERIOD 
nowadays this idea has a dramatic name :COLON spaceship earth .PERIOD 
and the idea there is that outside the spaceship ,COMMA the universe is implacably hostile ,COMMA and inside is all we have ,COMMA all we depend on .PERIOD 
and we only get the one chance :COLON if we mess up our spaceship ,COMMA we've got nowhere else to go .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history ,COMMA human beings are not ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the hub of existence .PERIOD 
as stephen hawking famously said ,COMMA we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star ,COMMA which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very un-typical place ,COMMA uniquely suited and so on ,COMMA and the second one is saying that we're at a typical place .PERIOD 
and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions ,COMMA then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .PERIOD 
but that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false .PERIOD 
and they are .PERIOD so let me start with the second one :COLON typical .PERIOD well -- is this a typical place ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA let's look around ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and look in a random direction ,COMMA and we see a wall ,COMMA and chemical scum -- -- and that's not typical of the universe at all .PERIOD 
all you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back ,COMMA and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet .PERIOD and if you go further than that ,COMMA you'll see the sun ,COMMA the solar system ,COMMA and the stars and so on .PERIOD 
but that's still not typical of the universe ,COMMA because stars come in galaxies .PERIOD 
and most places in the universe ,COMMA a typical place in the universe ,COMMA is nowhere near any galaxies .PERIOD 
so let's go out further ,COMMA till we're outside the galaxy ,COMMA and look back ,COMMA and yeah ,COMMA there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us .PERIOD 
and at this point we've come <NUM> light years from here .PERIOD 
but we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe .PERIOD 
to get to a typical place ,COMMA you've got to go <NUM> times as far as that into intergalactic space .PERIOD 
and so what does that look like ?QUESTIONMARK typical .PERIOD 
what does a typical place in the universe look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA at enormous expense ,COMMA ted has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space .PERIOD 
it's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you ,COMMA and that star were to explode as a supernova ,COMMA and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you ,COMMA you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer .PERIOD 
and that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright ,COMMA so brilliant an event ,COMMA that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years .PERIOD 
and yet from intergalactic space ,COMMA it's so far away you wouldn't even see it .PERIOD 
it's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero .PERIOD 
and it's very empty .PERIOD the vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on earth can currently create .PERIOD so that's how different a typical place is from this place .PERIOD 
so can we have the lights back on please ?QUESTIONMARK thank you .PERIOD 
now how do we know about an environment that's so far away ,COMMA and so different ,COMMA and so alien ,COMMA from anything we're used to ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA the earth -- our environment ,COMMA in the form of us -- is creating knowledge .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA look out even further than we've just been -- i mean from here ,COMMA with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars .PERIOD 
they're called quasars .PERIOD quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object .PERIOD 
which means things that look a bit like stars .PERIOD but they're not stars .PERIOD 
and we know what they are .PERIOD billions of years ago ,COMMA and billions of light years away ,COMMA the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole .PERIOD 
and then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse .PERIOD and some of the matter ,COMMA back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- i think it's a trillion suns .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet .PERIOD 
we couldn't survive for an instant in it .PERIOD language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets .PERIOD 
it would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion ,COMMA but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later ,COMMA on the other side of the universe ,COMMA some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe ,COMMA and model ,COMMA and predict ,COMMA and explain ,COMMA above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there ,COMMA in reality .PERIOD 
the one physical system ,COMMA the brain ,COMMA contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar .PERIOD 
not just a superficial image of it ,COMMA though it contains that as well ,COMMA but an explanatory model ,COMMA embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA the laws of physics have this special property .PERIOD 
that physical objects ,COMMA as unlike each other as they could possibly be ,COMMA can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .PERIOD 
so we are a chemical scum that is different .PERIOD this chemical scum has universality .PERIOD 
its structure contains ,COMMA with ever-increasing precision ,COMMA the structure of everything .PERIOD this place ,COMMA and not other places in the universe ,COMMA is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality .PERIOD and so ,COMMA far from being insignificant ,COMMA the fact that the laws of physics allow this ,COMMA or even mandate that this can happen ,COMMA is one of the most important things about the physical world .PERIOD 
we also need energy to make the computer ,COMMA and most important ,COMMA to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover .PERIOD 
and then thirdly ,COMMA less tangible ,COMMA but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge ,COMMA of explanations ,COMMA is evidence .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA our environment is inundated with evidence .PERIOD 
we happen to get round to testing ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA newton's law of gravity about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
but the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that ,COMMA and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards .PERIOD and the same is true for all the other sciences .PERIOD 
as far as we know ,COMMA evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet .PERIOD 
our location is saturated with evidence ,COMMA and also with matter and energy .PERIOD 
out in intergalactic space ,COMMA those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply .PERIOD 
as i said ,COMMA it's empty ;SEMICOLON it's cold ;SEMICOLON and it's dark out there .PERIOD or is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
now actually ,COMMA that's just another parochial misconception .PERIOD 
because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space ,COMMA the same size as our home ,COMMA the solar system .PERIOD now that cube is very empty by human standards ,COMMA but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter .PERIOD 
and a million tons is enough to make ,COMMA say ,COMMA a self-contained space station ,COMMA on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on .PERIOD 
but the thing is ,COMMA in a comprehensible universe ,COMMA if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics ,COMMA then what could possibly prevent us from doing it ,COMMA other than knowing how ?QUESTIONMARK 
in other words ,COMMA it's a matter of knowledge ,COMMA not resources .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA again ,COMMA it's dark out there to human senses .PERIOD but all you've got to do is take a telescope ,COMMA even one of present-day design ,COMMA look out and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here .PERIOD 
in those galaxies ,COMMA you'll be able to do astrophysics ,COMMA and learn the laws of physics .PERIOD 
probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back .PERIOD 
but i have to tell you -- and sorry ,COMMA richard -- but i never did like biology field trips much ,COMMA and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years .PERIOD 
so in fact ,COMMA intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge .PERIOD any such cube ,COMMA anywhere in the universe ,COMMA could become the same kind of hub that we are ,COMMA if the knowledge of how to do so were present there .PERIOD 
so we're not in a uniquely hospitable place .PERIOD 
if intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations ,COMMA then so is almost every other environment .PERIOD so is the earth .PERIOD so is a polluted earth .PERIOD 
and the limiting factor ,COMMA there and here ,COMMA is not resources ,COMMA because they're plentiful ,COMMA but knowledge ,COMMA which is scarce .PERIOD 
now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and i think ought to -- make us feel very special .PERIOD but it should also make us feel vulnerable ,COMMA because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe ,COMMA we won't survive them .PERIOD 
all it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away ,COMMA and we'll all be dead !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
martin rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things ,COMMA from astrophysics ,COMMA to scientific experiments gone wrong ,COMMA and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD 
and he thinks that civilization has only a <NUM> percent chance of surviving this century .PERIOD 
i think he's going to talk about that later in the conference .PERIOD 
now i don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in .PERIOD 
but i do agree with him about this .PERIOD we can survive ,COMMA and we can fail to survive .PERIOD 
but it depends not on chance ,COMMA but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time .PERIOD 
civilizations end .PERIOD the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history .PERIOD 
and if we want to be the exception to that ,COMMA then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species ,COMMA and our civilization ,COMMA from all the others -- namely ,COMMA our special relationship with the laws of physics ,COMMA our ability to create new explanations ,COMMA new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence .PERIOD 
so let me now apply this to a current controversy ,COMMA not because i want to advocate any particular solution ,COMMA but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean .PERIOD 
and the controversy is global warming .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i'm a physicist ,COMMA but i'm not the right kind of physicist .PERIOD in regard to global warming ,COMMA i'm just a layman .PERIOD and the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory .PERIOD and according to that theory ,COMMA it's already too late to avoid a disaster .PERIOD 
because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol ,COMMA with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is ,COMMA then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .PERIOD 
and the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem ,COMMA merely to postpone it by a little .PERIOD so it's already too late to avoid it ,COMMA and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger .PERIOD 
it was probably already too late in the 1970s ,COMMA when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die .PERIOD 
now the lesson of that seems clear to me ,COMMA and i don't know why it isn't informing public debate .PERIOD 
it is that we can't always know .PERIOD when we know of an impending disaster ,COMMA and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself ,COMMA then there's not going to be much argument ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
but no precautions ,COMMA and no precautionary principle ,COMMA can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee .PERIOD 
hence ,COMMA we need a stance of problem-fixing ,COMMA not just problem-avoidance .PERIOD 
if you've been punched on the nose ,COMMA then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches .PERIOD 
if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only ,COMMA then it would achieve very little of either .PERIOD 
it ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature ,COMMA and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs ,COMMA but efficiently and cheaply .PERIOD and some such plans exist ,COMMA things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away ,COMMA and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
at the moment ,COMMA these things are fringe research .PERIOD 
and with problems that we are not aware of yet ,COMMA the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope ,COMMA not just of solving problems ,COMMA but of survival .PERIOD 
so take two stone tablets ,COMMA and carve on them .PERIOD 
on one of them ,COMMA carve :COLON problems are soluble .PERIOD 
and on the other one carve :COLON problems are inevitable .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
at the break ,COMMA i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate .PERIOD 
and this will be my only comment on it .PERIOD 
what i'm going to tell you about in my <NUM> minutes is how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves .PERIOD 
that took a genome project from <NUM> years down to four months .PERIOD 
so in the last decade ,COMMA a large number of genomes have been added :COLON most human pathogens ,COMMA a couple of plants ,COMMA several insects and several mammals ,COMMA including the human genome .PERIOD 
genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over <NUM> years ago was ,COMMA by the end of this year ,COMMA we might have between three and five genomes sequenced ;SEMICOLON it's on the order of several hundred .PERIOD 
we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence <NUM> genomes this year ,COMMA as a side project from environmental organisms .PERIOD 
so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed .PERIOD 
but as we look ,COMMA what's out there ,COMMA we've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet .PERIOD 
most people don't realize it ,COMMA because they're invisible ,COMMA but microbes make up about a half of the earth's biomass ,COMMA whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass .PERIOD 
and maybe it's something that people in oxford don't do very often ,COMMA but if you ever make it to the sea ,COMMA and you swallow a mouthful of seawater ,COMMA keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of <NUM> million viruses .PERIOD 
less than <NUM> microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago ,COMMA and so we decided to do something about it .PERIOD 
we started in bermuda for our test project ,COMMA then moved up to halifax ,COMMA working down the us .PERIOD east coast ,COMMA the caribbean sea ,COMMA the panama canal ,COMMA through to the galapagos ,COMMA then across the pacific ,COMMA and we're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean .PERIOD 
it's very tough duty ;SEMICOLON we're doing this on a sailing vessel ,COMMA in part to help excite young people about going into science .PERIOD 
the experiments are incredibly simple .PERIOD 
we just take seawater and we filter it ,COMMA and we collect different size organisms on different filters ,COMMA and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville ,COMMA where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments .PERIOD 
it turns out ,COMMA almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors ,COMMA and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .PERIOD 
from one site ,COMMA from one barrel of seawater ,COMMA we discovered <NUM> million new genes and as many as <NUM> new species .PERIOD 
we've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation .PERIOD 
we're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day ,COMMA particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums .PERIOD 
we filter through some simple apparatuses ;SEMICOLON we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city .PERIOD 
and we're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time .PERIOD 
just on the data collection side ,COMMA just where we are through the galapagos ,COMMA we're finding that almost every <NUM> miles ,COMMA we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean .PERIOD 
some of these make logical sense ,COMMA in terms of different temperature gradients .PERIOD 
so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm ,COMMA blue being cold -- and we found there's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples ,COMMA in terms of abundant species .PERIOD 
the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light ,COMMA and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence .PERIOD 
and these vary tremendously from region to region .PERIOD 
maybe not surprisingly ,COMMA in the deep ocean ,COMMA where it's mostly blue ,COMMA the photoreceptors tend to see blue light .PERIOD 
when there's a lot of chlorophyll around ,COMMA they see a lot of green light .PERIOD 
but they vary even more ,COMMA possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes .PERIOD 
just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was ,COMMA we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition ,COMMA which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around <NUM> million genes .PERIOD 
and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are :COLON are we just discovering new members of known families ,COMMA or are we discovering new families ?QUESTIONMARK 
and it turns out we have about <NUM> major gene families ,COMMA but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families .PERIOD 
so we're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes ,COMMA components and life on this planet .PERIOD 
when we look at the so-called evolutionary tree ,COMMA we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals .PERIOD 
of those roughly <NUM> million genes ,COMMA we only have around <NUM> in our genome .PERIOD 
and if you take all animals together ,COMMA we probably share less than <NUM> and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families .PERIOD 
and we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to richard dawkins' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view ,COMMA which are different constructs of these gene components .PERIOD 
synthetic dna ,COMMA the ability to synthesize dna ,COMMA has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade or two ,COMMA and is getting very rapid and very cheap .PERIOD 
our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in <NUM> ,COMMA and that from mycoplasma genitalium .PERIOD 
and we have really nice t-shirts that say ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i heart my genitalium .PERIOD 
this is actually just a microorganism .PERIOD 
but it has roughly <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
haemophilus had <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
and we simply asked the question ,COMMA if one species needs <NUM> ,COMMA another <NUM> ,COMMA is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system ?QUESTIONMARK 
so we started doing transposon mutagenesis .PERIOD 
and if they insert in the middle of the gene ,COMMA they disrupt its function .PERIOD 
so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those non-essential genes .PERIOD 
but it turns out the environment is very critical for this ,COMMA and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment .PERIOD 
we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of <NUM> related organisms ,COMMA and we tried to compare all of those ,COMMA to see what they had in common .PERIOD 
and we got these overlapping circles .PERIOD and we found only <NUM> genes common to all <NUM> organisms .PERIOD 
the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite ;SEMICOLON it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around <NUM> or so .PERIOD 
so we think that we can expand or contract genomes ,COMMA depending on your point of view here ,COMMA to maybe <NUM> to <NUM> genes from the minimal of <NUM> .PERIOD 
the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them ,COMMA and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion .PERIOD 
ham smith and clyde hutchison ,COMMA my colleagues on this ,COMMA developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was <NUM> percent accurate ,COMMA in terms of its sequence and its biology .PERIOD 
it was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of dna ,COMMA injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden ,COMMA that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria .PERIOD 
this was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do .PERIOD 
this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x <NUM> .PERIOD 
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware ,COMMA and that's the notions that we have with biology .PERIOD 
people immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare ,COMMA and i had recent testimony before a senate committee ,COMMA and a special committee the us .PERIOD government has set up to review this area .PERIOD 
and i think it's important to keep reality in mind ,COMMA versus what happens with people's imaginations .PERIOD 
basically ,COMMA any virus that's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .PERIOD 
and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or smallpox ,COMMA but the dna from this organism is not infective .PERIOD 
so even if somebody made the smallpox genome ,COMMA that dna itself would not cause infections .PERIOD 
the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses .PERIOD 
if that research is truly discontinued ,COMMA there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future .PERIOD 
i think single-cell organisms are possible within two years .PERIOD 
and possibly eukaryotic cells ,COMMA those that we have ,COMMA are possible within a decade .PERIOD 
so we're now making several dozen different constructs ,COMMA because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome .PERIOD 
the key is ,COMMA how do you put all of the others ?QUESTIONMARK 
we start with these fragments ,COMMA and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome .PERIOD 
this is derived from an organism ,COMMA deinococcus radiodurans ,COMMA that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed .PERIOD 
it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about <NUM> to <NUM> hours ,COMMA after its chromosomes are literally blown apart .PERIOD 
this organism is ubiquitous on the planet ,COMMA and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there .PERIOD 
this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation .PERIOD 
the glass started to burn and crack ,COMMA while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier .PERIOD 
here's an actual picture of what happens :COLON the top of this shows the genome after <NUM> million rads of radiation .PERIOD 
the chromosome is literally blown apart .PERIOD 
and here's that same dna automatically reassembled <NUM> hours later .PERIOD 
it's truly stunning that these organisms can do that ,COMMA and we probably have thousands ,COMMA if not tens of thousands ,COMMA of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that .PERIOD 
after these genomes are synthesized ,COMMA the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome .PERIOD 
so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential ,COMMA not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA from the third organism we sequenced ,COMMA methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures ;SEMICOLON its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co2 it captures back from the environment .PERIOD 
so we know lots of different pathways ,COMMA thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 ,COMMA and can capture that back .PERIOD 
so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes ,COMMA we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere ,COMMA converting that into biopolymers or other products .PERIOD 
we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide ,COMMA and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen .PERIOD 
also ,COMMA there's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane .PERIOD 
and dupont has a major program with statoil in norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products .PERIOD 
within a short while ,COMMA i think there's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics ,COMMA because with these new synthesis capabilities ,COMMA these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination ,COMMA we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day .PERIOD 
and therefore ,COMMA as with all biology ,COMMA you get selection through screening ,COMMA whether you're screening for hydrogen production ,COMMA or chemical production ,COMMA or just viability .PERIOD 
to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach .PERIOD 
we're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight .PERIOD 
photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen ,COMMA and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process .PERIOD 
we're also combining cellulases ,COMMA the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol .PERIOD 
pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes .PERIOD 
the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce .PERIOD 
let me just close with ethical and policy studies .PERIOD 
we delayed the start of our experiments in <NUM> until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species .PERIOD 
every major religion participated in this .PERIOD 
right now the sloan foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this ,COMMA to work out what the risk and benefits to society are ,COMMA and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area ,COMMA and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward .PERIOD 
these are complex issues .PERIOD 
except for the threat of bio-terrorism ,COMMA they're very simple issues in terms of ,COMMA can we design things to produce clean energy ,COMMA perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
take a look at this picture .PERIOD 
these african students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they don't have any electricity at home .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA i haven't met these particular students ,COMMA but i've met students like them .PERIOD 
let's just pick one -- for example ,COMMA the one in the green shirt .PERIOD 
let's give him a name ,COMMA too :COLON nelson .PERIOD 
i'll bet nelson has a cellphone .PERIOD 
so here is the puzzle .PERIOD 
why is it that nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology ,COMMA like the cellphone ,COMMA but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology for generating electric light in the home ?QUESTIONMARK 
now ,COMMA in a word ,COMMA the answer is rules .PERIOD 
bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson .PERIOD 
what kinds of rules ?QUESTIONMARK 
the electric company in this nation operates under a rule ,COMMA which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low ,COMMA subsidized price -- in fact ,COMMA a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells .PERIOD 
so it has neither the resources ,COMMA nor the incentives ,COMMA to hook up many other users .PERIOD 
the president wanted to change this rule .PERIOD 
he's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules ,COMMA rules where businesses earn a small profit ,COMMA so they have an incentive to sign up more customers .PERIOD 
that's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that nelson purchases his telephony from operates under .PERIOD 
the president has seen how those rules worked well .PERIOD 
so he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity ,COMMA but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates .PERIOD 
so he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country .PERIOD 
and nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights .PERIOD 
the real challenge then ,COMMA is to try to figure out how we can change rules .PERIOD 
are there some rules we can develop for changing rules ?QUESTIONMARK 
i want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA if we can give more choices to people ,COMMA and more choices to leaders -- who ,COMMA in many countries ,COMMA are also people .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA it's useful to present the opposition between these two .PERIOD 
because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader ,COMMA a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity ,COMMA takes away a choice that people in the economy want .PERIOD 
they want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power .PERIOD 
so if you give just to one side or the other ,COMMA you'll have tension or friction .PERIOD 
but if we can find ways to give more choices to both ,COMMA that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA nelson also has access to the internet .PERIOD 
and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules ,COMMA the ways that rules can keep people in the dark ,COMMA look at the pictures from nasa of the earth at night .PERIOD 
if you zoom in here ,COMMA you can see north korea ,COMMA in outline here ,COMMA which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA you won't be surprised to learn that the rules in north korea keep people there in the dark .PERIOD 
but it is important to recognize that north korea and south korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations ,COMMA but also in the deeper senses of understandings ,COMMA norms ,COMMA culture ,COMMA values and beliefs .PERIOD 
when they separated ,COMMA they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules .PERIOD 
so we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other ,COMMA for better ,COMMA or for worse .PERIOD 
now let's look at another region ,COMMA the caribbean .PERIOD 
haiti is also dark ,COMMA compared to its neighbor here ,COMMA the dominican republic ,COMMA which has about the same number of residents .PERIOD 
both of these countries are dark compared to puerto rico ,COMMA which has half as many residents as either haiti or the dominican republic .PERIOD 
what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .PERIOD 
it's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive ,COMMA as in north korea .PERIOD 
so that if we want to create environments with good rules ,COMMA we can't just tear down .PERIOD 
we've got to find ways to build up ,COMMA as well .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA china dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules .PERIOD 
back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart ,COMMA china was the world's high-technology leader .PERIOD 
chinese had pioneered technologies like steel ,COMMA printing ,COMMA gunpowder .PERIOD 
but the chinese never adopted ,COMMA at least in that period ,COMMA effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread .PERIOD 
and they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut china off from the rest of the world .PERIOD 
so as other countries in the world innovated ,COMMA in the sense both of developing newer technologies ,COMMA but also developing newer rules ,COMMA the chinese were cut off from those advances .PERIOD 
income there stayed stagnant ,COMMA as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world .PERIOD 
this next chart looks at more recent data .PERIOD 
it plots income ,COMMA average income in china as a percentage of average income in the united states .PERIOD 
in the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent .PERIOD 
but then in the late '70s something changed .PERIOD 
growth took off in china .PERIOD the chinese started catching up very quickly with the united states .PERIOD 
if you go back to the map at night ,COMMA you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in china .PERIOD 
the brightest spot in china ,COMMA which you can see on the edge of the outline here ,COMMA is hong kong .PERIOD 
hong kong was a small bit of china that ,COMMA for most of the 20th century ,COMMA operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland china -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time ,COMMA and administered by the british .PERIOD 
in the 1950s ,COMMA hong kong was a place where millions of people could go ,COMMA from the mainland ,COMMA to start in jobs like sewing shirts ,COMMA making toys .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA to get on a process of increasing income ,COMMA increasing skills led to very rapid growth there .PERIOD 
hong kong was also the model which leaders like deng xiaoping could copy ,COMMA when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model .PERIOD 
so instead of forcing everyone in china to shift immediately to the market model ,COMMA they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA what britain did :COLON make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there .PERIOD 
so they created four special economic zones around hong kong :COLON zones where chinese could come and work ,COMMA and cities grew up very rapidly there ;SEMICOLON also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things .PERIOD 
one of the zones next to hong kong has a city called shenzhen .PERIOD 
in that city there is a taiwanese firm that made the iphone that many of you have ,COMMA and they made it with labor from chinese who moved there to shenzhen .PERIOD 
so after the four special zones ,COMMA there were <NUM> coastal cites that were open in the same sense ,COMMA and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to ,COMMA that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered .PERIOD 
now the chinese example shows us several points .PERIOD 
one is :COLON preserve choices for people .PERIOD 
two :COLON operate on the right scale .PERIOD 
if you try to change the rules in a village ,COMMA you could do that ,COMMA but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules .PERIOD 
on the other hand ,COMMA the nation is too big .PERIOD 
if you try to change the rules in the nation ,COMMA you can't give some people a chance to hold back ,COMMA see how things turn out ,COMMA and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules .PERIOD 
but cities give you this opportunity to create new places ,COMMA with new rules that people can opt in to .PERIOD 
and they're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules .PERIOD 
so the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city .PERIOD 
we start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we'll need to build the city .PERIOD 
we'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system ,COMMA the roads ,COMMA the port ,COMMA the airport ,COMMA the buildings .PERIOD 
you'll need to attract firms ,COMMA who will come hire the people who move there first .PERIOD 
and you'll need to attract families ,COMMA the residents who will come and live there permanently ,COMMA raise their children ,COMMA get an education for their children ,COMMA and get their first job .PERIOD 
with that charter ,COMMA people will move there .PERIOD 
the city can be built .PERIOD 
and we can scale this model .PERIOD 
to make it work ,COMMA we need good rules .PERIOD we've already discussed that .PERIOD 
those are captured in the charter .PERIOD 
that's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land .PERIOD 
you start from uninhabited territory .PERIOD 
people can come live under the new charter ,COMMA but no one is forced to live under it .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations :COLON cases where nations work together ,COMMA in effect ,COMMA de facto ,COMMA the way china and britain worked together to build ,COMMA first a little enclave of the market model ,COMMA and then scale it throughout china .PERIOD 
in a sense ,COMMA britain ,COMMA inadvertently ,COMMA through its actions in hong kong ,COMMA did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we've undertaken in the last century .PERIOD 
so if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again ,COMMA we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world .PERIOD 
in some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility ,COMMA a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities .PERIOD 
it's not .PERIOD but it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things ,COMMA can get in the way ,COMMA can make us pull back ,COMMA can shut down our ability ,COMMA and our interest in trying to explore new ideas .PERIOD 
why is this not like colonialism ?QUESTIONMARK 
the thing that was bad about colonialism ,COMMA and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs ,COMMA is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension .PERIOD 
this model is all about choices ,COMMA both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension .PERIOD 
so let's talk about how this could play out in practice .PERIOD 
let's take a particular leader ,COMMA raul castro ,COMMA who is the leader of cuba .PERIOD 
it must have occurred to castro that he has the chance to do for cuba what deng xiaoping did for china ,COMMA but he doesn't have a hong kong there on the island in cuba .PERIOD 
he does ,COMMA though ,COMMA have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status .PERIOD 
there is a zone there ,COMMA around guantanamo bay ,COMMA where a treaty gives the united states administrative responsibility for a piece of land that's about twice the size of manhattan .PERIOD 
castro goes to the prime minister of canada and says ,COMMA look ,COMMA the yankees have a terrible pr problem .PERIOD 
they want to get out .PERIOD 
why don't you ,COMMA canada ,COMMA take over ?QUESTIONMARK 
build -- run a special administrative zone .PERIOD 
allow a new city to be built up there .PERIOD 
allow many people to come in .PERIOD 
others will hold back .PERIOD but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA where else might this model be tried ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA africa .PERIOD i've talked with leaders in africa .PERIOD 
it's a rule for changing rules .PERIOD 
it's a way to create new rules ,COMMA and let people opt-in without coercion ,COMMA and the opposition that coercion can force .PERIOD 
they also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long-term investors -- the kind of investors who will come build the port ,COMMA build the roads ,COMMA in a new city -- they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation .PERIOD 
perhaps even in some arrangement that's a little bit like an escrow account ,COMMA where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it .PERIOD 
there is also lots of land in africa where new cities could be built .PERIOD 
this is a picture i took when i was flying along the coast .PERIOD 
there are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites ,COMMA but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions ,COMMA perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA throughout the world ,COMMA if we look at the lights at night ,COMMA the one thing that's misleading is that ,COMMA visually ,COMMA it looks like most of the world is already built out .PERIOD 
turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on earth .PERIOD 
and let these dots represent the land that's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in .PERIOD 
if you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth .PERIOD 
so if we wanted to build cities for another billion people ,COMMA they would be dots like this .PERIOD 
we'd go from three percent of the arable land ,COMMA to four percent .PERIOD 
we'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on earth by building more cities that people can move to .PERIOD 
and if these are cities governed by good rules ,COMMA they can be cities where people are safe from crime ,COMMA safe from disease and bad sanitation ,COMMA where people have a chance to get a job .PERIOD 
they can get basic utilities like electricity .PERIOD 
it would help to have a manual .PERIOD 
what university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual .PERIOD 
you wouldn't want to let us run the cities ,COMMA go out and design them .PERIOD 
you wouldn't let academics out in the wild .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA you could set us to work thinking about questions like ,COMMA suppose it isn't just canada that does the deal with raul castro .PERIOD 
perhaps brazil comes in as a participant ,COMMA and spain as well .PERIOD and perhaps cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture .PERIOD 
how would we write the treaty to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
there is less precedent for that ,COMMA but that could easily be worked out .PERIOD 
how would we finance this ?QUESTIONMARK 
turns out singapore and hong kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started .PERIOD 
you could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police ,COMMA the courts ,COMMA but the school system and the health care system too ,COMMA which make this a more attractive place to live ,COMMA makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA makes the land more valuable .PERIOD 
so the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it ,COMMA and set up the basic rules ,COMMA go very much in the right direction .PERIOD 
so there are many other details like this .PERIOD 
how could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job ,COMMA assembling something like an iphone ,COMMA but make those buildings energy efficient ,COMMA and make sure that they are safe ,COMMA so they don't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane .PERIOD 
many technical details to be worked out ,COMMA but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock ,COMMA there's no impediment ,COMMA other than a failure of imagination ,COMMA that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution .PERIOD 
let me conclude with this picture .PERIOD 
the reason we can be so well off ,COMMA even though there is so many people on earth ,COMMA is because of the power of ideas .PERIOD 
we can share ideas with other people ,COMMA and when they discover them ,COMMA they share with us .PERIOD 
it's not like scarce objects ,COMMA where sharing means we each get less .PERIOD 
when we share ideas we all get more .PERIOD 
when we think about ideas in that way ,COMMA we usually think about technologies .PERIOD 
but there is another class of ideas :COLON the rules that govern how we interact with each other ;SEMICOLON rules like ,COMMA let's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free .PERIOD 
if we can keep innovating on our space of rules ,COMMA and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules ,COMMA so we don't get stuck with bad rules ,COMMA then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place ,COMMA so that people like nelson and his friends don't have to study any longer under the streetlights .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time ,COMMA in a very short time .PERIOD

i don't know ,COMMA guys .PERIOD 
okay .PERIOD one bite .PERIOD what the hell ?QUESTIONMARK 
promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment .PERIOD 
of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you george bush -- the majority ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA yielded to sexual temptations within one year .PERIOD 
and most of them did so without using birth control .PERIOD 
so much for promises .PERIOD 
now lets tempt four-year-olds ,COMMA giving them a treat .PERIOD 
they can have one marshmallow now .PERIOD but if they wait until the experimenter comes back ,COMMA they can have two .PERIOD 
of course it pays ,COMMA if you like marshmallows ,COMMA to wait .PERIOD 
what happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation .PERIOD 
they cannot wait .PERIOD the others ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wait .PERIOD 
they resist the temptation .PERIOD they delay the now for later .PERIOD 
walter mischel ,COMMA my colleague at stanford ,COMMA went back <NUM> years later ,COMMA to try to discover what was different about those kids .PERIOD 
there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded ,COMMA in many ways .PERIOD 
the kids who resisted scored <NUM> points higher on the sat .PERIOD 
that's enormous .PERIOD that's like a whole set of different iq points .PERIOD 
they didn't get in as much trouble .PERIOD they were better students .PERIOD 
they were self-confident and determined .PERIOD and the key for me today ,COMMA the key for you ,COMMA is ,COMMA they were future-focused rather than present-focused .PERIOD 
so what is time perspective ?QUESTIONMARK that's what i'm going to talk about today .PERIOD 
time perspective is the study of how individuals ,COMMA all of us ,COMMA divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories .PERIOD 
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .PERIOD 
they vary between cultures ,COMMA between nations ,COMMA between individuals ,COMMA between social classes ,COMMA between education levels .PERIOD 
and the problem is that they can become biased ,COMMA because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others .PERIOD 
you make a decision on which you're going to base an action .PERIOD 
for some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation ,COMMA what other people are doing and what you're feeling .PERIOD 
and those people ,COMMA when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them present-oriented ,COMMA because their focus is what is now .PERIOD 
for others ,COMMA the present is irrelevant .PERIOD 
it's always about what is this situation like that i've experienced in the past ?QUESTIONMARK 
so that their decisions are based on past memories .PERIOD 
and we're going to call those people past-oriented ,COMMA because they focus on what was .PERIOD 
for others it's not the past ,COMMA it's not the present ,COMMA it's only about the future .PERIOD 
their focus is always about anticipated consequences .PERIOD 
cost-benefit analysis .PERIOD 
we're going to call them future-oriented .PERIOD their focus is on what will be .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA time paradox ,COMMA i want to argue ,COMMA the paradox of time perspective ,COMMA is something that influences every decision you make ,COMMA you're totally unaware of .PERIOD 
namely ,COMMA the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives .PERIOD 
well there is actually six of them .PERIOD there are two ways to be present-oriented .PERIOD 
there is two ways to be past-oriented ,COMMA two ways to be future .PERIOD 
you can be present-hedonistic ,COMMA namely you focus on the joys of life ,COMMA or present-fatalist -- it doesn't matter ,COMMA your life is controlled .PERIOD 
you can be future-oriented ,COMMA setting goals .PERIOD 
or you can be transcendental future :COLON namely ,COMMA life begins after death .PERIOD 
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation ,COMMA that's what you've got to learn to do .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA what is the optimal time profile ?QUESTIONMARK 
high on past-positive .PERIOD moderately high on future .PERIOD 
and always low on past-negative and present-fatalism .PERIOD 
so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots .PERIOD you connect your family ,COMMA identity and your self .PERIOD 
what you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations ,COMMA new challenges .PERIOD 
what you get from the present hedonism is the energy ,COMMA the energy to explore yourself ,COMMA places ,COMMA people ,COMMA sensuality .PERIOD 
any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives .PERIOD 
what do futures sacrifice for success ?QUESTIONMARK 
they sacrifice fun time .PERIOD they sacrifice personal indulgence .PERIOD 
they sacrifice hobbies .PERIOD and they sacrifice sleep .PERIOD so it affects their health .PERIOD 
and they live for work ,COMMA achievement and control .PERIOD 
and it resonated for me .PERIOD i grew up as a poor kid in the south bronx ghetto ,COMMA a sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present .PERIOD 
i'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top ,COMMA who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened ,COMMA and made me future oriented .PERIOD 
i've added present-hedonism ,COMMA i've added a focus on the past-positive ,COMMA so ,COMMA at <NUM> years old ,COMMA i am more energetic than ever ,COMMA more productive ,COMMA and i'm happier than i have ever been .PERIOD 
i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems :COLON changing the drop-out rates of school kids ,COMMA combating addictions ,COMMA enhancing teen health ,COMMA curing vets' ptsd with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation ,COMMA reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate ,COMMA altering appeals to suicidal terrorists ,COMMA and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes .PERIOD 
so i want to end by saying :COLON many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .PERIOD 
and the idea is so simple ,COMMA so obvious ,COMMA but i think the consequences are really profound .PERIOD 
thank you so much .PERIOD 
in the next <NUM> minutes ,COMMA i'm going to take you on a journey .PERIOD 
and it's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now ,COMMA and it began some <NUM> years ago ,COMMA when humans first stepped off our planet .PERIOD 
and in those <NUM> years ,COMMA not only did we literally ,COMMA physically set foot on the moon ,COMMA but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids ,COMMA we have rendezvoused with comets ,COMMA and ,COMMA at this point in time ,COMMA we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto ,COMMA the body formerly known as a planet .PERIOD 
and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey :COLON a voyage to understand something ,COMMA to get a sense of our cosmic place ,COMMA to understand something of our origins ,COMMA and how earth ,COMMA our planet ,COMMA and we ,COMMA living on it ,COMMA came to be .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA the saturn system is a rich planetary system .PERIOD 
it offers mystery ,COMMA scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare ,COMMA and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach .PERIOD 
and here's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula ,COMMA which is our closest ,COMMA largest spiral galaxy to the milky way .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA here's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy ,COMMA taken by the hubble space telescope .PERIOD 
so the journey back to saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us ,COMMA and also how humans fit into that picture .PERIOD 
and it pains me that i can't tell you all that we have learned with cassini .PERIOD 
i can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken in the last two and a half years ,COMMA because i simply don't have the time .PERIOD 
so i'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn ,COMMA and have been for the past two and a half years .PERIOD 
saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .PERIOD 
they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the us .PERIOD 
most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of saturn ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons .PERIOD here's saturn with dione ,COMMA and then ,COMMA here's saturn showing the rings edge-on ,COMMA showing you just how vertically thin they are ,COMMA with the moon enceladus .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA two of the <NUM> moons that saturn has are standouts .PERIOD 
and those are titan and enceladus .PERIOD titan is saturn's largest moon ,COMMA and ,COMMA until cassini had arrived there ,COMMA was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system .PERIOD 
and it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets .PERIOD 
it has a very large ,COMMA thick atmosphere ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth ,COMMA or at least had in the past ,COMMA than any other body in the solar system .PERIOD 
its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen ,COMMA like you are breathing here in this room ,COMMA except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane .PERIOD 
this haze is ubiquitous .PERIOD it's completely global and enveloping titan .PERIOD 
and that's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum .PERIOD 
but these haze particles ,COMMA it was surmised ,COMMA before we got there with cassini ,COMMA over billions and billions of years ,COMMA gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge .PERIOD 
so like the equivalent ,COMMA the titan equivalent ,COMMA of tar ,COMMA or oil ,COMMA or what -- we didn't know what .PERIOD 
but this is what we suspected .PERIOD and these molecules ,COMMA especially methane and ethane ,COMMA can be liquids at the surface temperatures of titan .PERIOD 
and so it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth .PERIOD 
it's a condensable in the atmosphere ,COMMA and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities .PERIOD you can have methane clouds ,COMMA ok ,COMMA and above those clouds ,COMMA you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze ,COMMA which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface .PERIOD 
the temperature at the surface is some <NUM> degrees below zero fahrenheit .PERIOD 
but despite that cold ,COMMA you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan .PERIOD 
and doing on titan what rain does on the earth :COLON it carves gullies ;SEMICOLON it forms rivers and cataracts ;SEMICOLON it can create canyons ;SEMICOLON it can pool in large basins and craters .PERIOD 
it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills ,COMMA down into the lowlands .PERIOD so stop and think for a minute .PERIOD 
it's dark .PERIOD high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth .PERIOD 
that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini ,COMMA and i can tell you that what we have found on titan ,COMMA though it is not the same in detail ,COMMA is every bit as fascinating as that story is .PERIOD 
and for us ,COMMA it has been like -- the cassini people -- it has been like a jules verne adventure come true .PERIOD 
this is a picture of titan ,COMMA backlit by the sun ,COMMA with the rings as a beautiful backdrop .PERIOD 
and yet another moon there -- i don't even know which one it is .PERIOD it's a very extensive atmosphere .PERIOD 
and we have taken pictures like this .PERIOD 
and what you see is bright and dark regions ,COMMA and that's about as far as it got for us .PERIOD 
it was so mystifying :COLON we couldn't make out what we were seeing on titan .PERIOD 
when you look closer at this region ,COMMA you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn't know .PERIOD you see a few round things .PERIOD 
this ,COMMA we later found out ,COMMA is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a crater ,COMMA but there are very few craters on the surface of titan ,COMMA meaning it's a very young surface .PERIOD 
and there are features that look tectonic .PERIOD 
whenever you see anything linear on a planet ,COMMA it means there's been a fracture ,COMMA like a fault .PERIOD 
and so it's been tectonically altered .PERIOD 
but we couldn't make sense of our images ,COMMA until ,COMMA six months after we got into orbit ,COMMA an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini's investigation of titan .PERIOD 
and that was the deployment of the huygens probe ,COMMA the european-built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system .PERIOD we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan ,COMMA it took two and a half hours to descend ,COMMA and it landed on the surface .PERIOD 
and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is .PERIOD 
this is a device of human making ,COMMA and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history .PERIOD 
it is so significant that ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the us .PERIOD and europe ,COMMA and sadly ,COMMA that wasn't the case .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
it was significant for another reason .PERIOD this is an international mission ,COMMA and this event was celebrated in europe ,COMMA in germany ,COMMA and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents ,COMMA and american accents ,COMMA and german accents ,COMMA and french and italian and dutch accents .PERIOD 
it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations are supposed to mean :COLON a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet ,COMMA and to come to understand a planetary system that ,COMMA for all of human history ,COMMA had been unreachable ,COMMA and now humans had actually touched it .PERIOD 
it was a tremendously emotional event ,COMMA and it's something that i will personally never forget ,COMMA and you shouldn't either .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
but anyway ,COMMA the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down ,COMMA and it also took panoramic pictures .PERIOD 
and i can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan's surface from the probe .PERIOD and this is what we saw .PERIOD 
and it was a shocker ,COMMA because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .PERIOD 
it was an unambiguous pattern ,COMMA a geological pattern .PERIOD 
it's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids .PERIOD 
and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge .PERIOD 
and they converge into this channel here ,COMMA which drains into this region .PERIOD 
you are looking at a shoreline .PERIOD 
was this a shoreline of fluids ?QUESTIONMARK we didn't know .PERIOD 
this picture is taken at <NUM> kilometers .PERIOD 
this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK again ,COMMA the shoreline .PERIOD 
okay ,COMMA now ,COMMA <NUM> kilometers ,COMMA eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude .PERIOD 
if you were going to take an airplane trip across the us ,COMMA you would be flying at these altitudes .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan .PERIOD 
and then finally ,COMMA the probe came to rest on the surface ,COMMA and i'm going to show you ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system .PERIOD 
and here is the horizon ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
these are probably water ice pebbles ,COMMA yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
 .PERIOD 
what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat .PERIOD 
this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane .PERIOD 
and that is what the huygens probe landed in .PERIOD 
but still ,COMMA there was no sign in our images ,COMMA or even in the huygens' images ,COMMA of any large ,COMMA open bodies of fluids .PERIOD 
where were they ?QUESTIONMARK it got even more puzzling when we found dunes .PERIOD 
ok ,COMMA so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan ,COMMA showing these dunes .PERIOD these are dunes that are <NUM> meters tall ,COMMA separated by a few kilometers ,COMMA and they go on for miles and miles and miles .PERIOD 
there's hundreds ,COMMA up to a <NUM> or <NUM> miles of dunes .PERIOD 
this is the saharan desert of titan .PERIOD 
it's obviously a place which is very dry ,COMMA or you wouldn't get dunes .PERIOD 
so again ,COMMA it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid ,COMMA until finally ,COMMA we saw lakes in the polar regions .PERIOD 
and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan .PERIOD 
it's about the size of lake ontario .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA only a week and a half ago ,COMMA we flew over the north pole of titan and found ,COMMA again ,COMMA we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea .PERIOD 
so it seems that the liquids ,COMMA for some reason we don't understand ,COMMA or during at least this season ,COMMA are apparently at the poles of titan .PERIOD 
and so now we go onto enceladus .PERIOD enceladus is a small moon ,COMMA it's about a tenth the size of titan .PERIOD and you can see it here next to england ,COMMA just to show you the size .PERIOD this is not meant to be a threat .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
and enceladus is very white ,COMMA it's very bright ,COMMA and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures .PERIOD 
but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures .PERIOD 
and they're a different color because they're a different composition .PERIOD 
they are coated .PERIOD these fractures are coated with organic materials .PERIOD 
moreover ,COMMA this whole ,COMMA entire region ,COMMA the south polar region ,COMMA has elevated temperatures .PERIOD it's the hottest place on the planet ,COMMA on the body .PERIOD 
that's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA when we took additional pictures ,COMMA we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine ,COMMA icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space .PERIOD 
and when we color-code this image ,COMMA to bring out the faint light levels ,COMMA we see that these jets feed a plume that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA we see ,COMMA in other images ,COMMA goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus .PERIOD 
my team and i have examined images like this ,COMMA and like this one ,COMMA and have thought about the other results from cassini .PERIOD 
and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus .PERIOD 
so we have ,COMMA possibly ,COMMA liquid water ,COMMA organic materials and excess heat .PERIOD 
in other words ,COMMA we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration ,COMMA or in other words ,COMMA an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .PERIOD 
and i don't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system ,COMMA whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere ,COMMA would have enormous cultural and scientific implications .PERIOD 
because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once ,COMMA but twice ,COMMA independently ,COMMA in our solar system ,COMMA then that means ,COMMA by inference ,COMMA it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its <NUM> billion year history .PERIOD 
right now ,COMMA earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life .PERIOD 
it is precious ,COMMA it is unique ,COMMA it is still ,COMMA so far ,COMMA the only home we've ever known .PERIOD 
and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we'd forgive you ,COMMA if you weren't ,COMMA ok -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo <NUM> astronauts in <NUM> .PERIOD 
it was the first time that earth was imaged from space ,COMMA and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe ,COMMA and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA we on cassini have taken an equivalent first ,COMMA a picture that no human eye has ever seen before .PERIOD 
it is a total eclipse of the sun ,COMMA seen from the other side of saturn .PERIOD 
and in this impossibly beautiful picture ,COMMA you see the main rings backlit by the sun ,COMMA you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA by the exhalations of enceladus .PERIOD 
but as if that weren't brilliant enough ,COMMA we can spot ,COMMA in this beautiful image ,COMMA sight of our own planet ,COMMA cradled in the arms of saturn's rings .PERIOD 
now ,COMMA there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar ,COMMA and capturing the sight of our little ,COMMA blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds .PERIOD 
and that ,COMMA and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that ,COMMA may be ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago .PERIOD 
and thank you very much .PERIOD 
we are drowning in news .PERIOD 
reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .PERIOD 
that's just one source .PERIOD 
my question is :COLON how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's the idea behind the long news .PERIOD 
it's a project by the long now foundation ,COMMA which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand .PERIOD 
and what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter <NUM> or <NUM> or <NUM> years from now .PERIOD 
and when you look at the news through that filter ,COMMA a lot falls by the wayside .PERIOD 
to take the top stories from the ap .PERIOD this last year ,COMMA is this going to matter in a decade ?QUESTIONMARK 
or this ?QUESTIONMARK 
is this going to matter in <NUM> or <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
okay ,COMMA that was kind of cool .PERIOD 
but the top story of this past year was the economy ,COMMA and i'm just betting that ,COMMA sooner or later ,COMMA this particular recession is going to be old news .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA let's take science .PERIOD 
someday ,COMMA little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .PERIOD 
that someday is already here if you're a mouse .PERIOD 
some recent stories :COLON nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ;SEMICOLON they're sending genes into the brain ;SEMICOLON a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .PERIOD 
what about resources ?QUESTIONMARK how are we going to feed nine billion people ?QUESTIONMARK 
as we heard yesterday ,COMMA there's over a billion people hungry .PERIOD 
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .PERIOD 
bill gates ,COMMA fortunately ,COMMA has bet a billion on [agricultural] research .PERIOD 
what about global politics ?QUESTIONMARK 
the world's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda ,COMMA and they may .PERIOD 
they've overtaken the us .PERIOD as the world's biggest car market ,COMMA they've overtaken germany as the largest exporter ,COMMA and they've started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers .PERIOD 
we're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know .PERIOD 
some recent discoveries :COLON there's an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but antarctica ;SEMICOLON there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery -- soon ,COMMA science may no longer need us ,COMMA and life may no longer need us either ;SEMICOLON a microbe wakes up after <NUM> years .PERIOD 
it seems that with or without us ,COMMA life will go on .PERIOD 
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one :COLON water found on the moon .PERIOD 
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .PERIOD 
and if nasa doesn't do it ,COMMA china might ,COMMA or somebody in this room might write a big check .PERIOD 
my point is this :COLON in the long run ,COMMA some news stories are more important than others .PERIOD 
in <NUM> ,COMMA cyclone nargis devastated myanmar .PERIOD 
millions of people were in severe need of help .PERIOD 
the un .PERIOD wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .PERIOD 
but there were no maps ,COMMA no maps of roads ,COMMA no maps showing hospitals ,COMMA no way for help to reach the cyclone victims .PERIOD 
the un .PERIOD ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces :COLON not having detailed maps .PERIOD 
but help was coming .PERIOD 
and it took them four days .PERIOD 
the new software they used ?QUESTIONMARK google mapmaker .PERIOD 
google mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .PERIOD 
people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers ,COMMA from schools to local businesses ,COMMA and video stores to the corner store .PERIOD 
maps matter .PERIOD 
for example ,COMMA a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone .PERIOD 
in the last year alone ,COMMA thousands of users in <NUM> countries have mapped millions of pieces of information ,COMMA and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .PERIOD 
and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .PERIOD 
let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now .PERIOD 
so ,COMMA as we speak ,COMMA people are mapping the world in these <NUM> countries .PERIOD 
you can see bridget in africa who just mapped a road in senegal .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA closer to home ,COMMA chalua ,COMMA an ng .PERIOD road in bangalore .PERIOD 
this is the result of computational geometry ,COMMA gesture recognition ,COMMA and machine learning .PERIOD 
this is a victory of thousands of users ,COMMA in hundreds of cities ,COMMA one user ,COMMA one edit at a time .PERIOD 
this is an invitation to the <NUM> percent of our unmapped planet .PERIOD 
i'm a filmmaker .PERIOD 
for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means .PERIOD 
why aren't palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?QUESTIONMARK 
the challenge i face when i hear this question is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers .PERIOD 
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .PERIOD 
yet ,COMMA most of you have probably never heard about them .PERIOD 
this divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful .PERIOD 
so i'm here today to talk about the power of attention ,COMMA the power of your attention ,COMMA and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank ,COMMA gaza and elsewhere -- but today ,COMMA my case study is going to be palestine .PERIOD 
i believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence ,COMMA but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .PERIOD 
allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus .PERIOD 
about seven years ago ,COMMA they faced extinction ,COMMA because israel announced it would build a separation barrier ,COMMA and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .PERIOD 
they would lose <NUM> percent of their land and be surrounded ,COMMA so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank .PERIOD 
through inspired local leadership ,COMMA they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening .PERIOD 
let me show you some brief clips ,COMMA so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground .PERIOD 
palestinian woman :COLON we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel .PERIOD 
here in budrus ,COMMA we realized the wall would steal our land .PERIOD 
israeli man :COLON the fence has ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA created a solution to terror .PERIOD 
man :COLON today you're invited to a peaceful march .PERIOD 
you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters .PERIOD 
israeli activist :COLON nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .PERIOD 
woman :COLON we saw the men trying to push the soldiers ,COMMA but none of them could do that .PERIOD 
but i think the girls could do it .PERIOD 
fatah party member :COLON we must empty our minds of traditional thinking .PERIOD 
hamas party member :COLON we were in complete harmony ,COMMA and we wanted to spread it to all of palestine .PERIOD 
chanting :COLON one united nation .PERIOD 
fatah ,COMMA hamas and the popular front !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
news anchor :COLON the clashes over the fence continue .PERIOD 
reporter :COLON israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .PERIOD 
they were allowed to use any force necessary .PERIOD 
man :COLON these are live bullets .PERIOD 
it's like fallujah .PERIOD shooting everywhere .PERIOD 
israeli activist :COLON i was sure we were all going to die .PERIOD 
but there were others around me who weren't even cowering .PERIOD 
protester :COLON this is a peaceful march .PERIOD 
there is no need to use violence .PERIOD 
chanting :COLON we can do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK we can do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
we can do it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful .PERIOD 
the residents ,COMMA after <NUM> months of peaceful resistance ,COMMA convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line ,COMMA which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories .PERIOD 
the resistance in budrus has since spread to villages across the west bank and to palestinian neighborhoods in jerusalem .PERIOD 
yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .PERIOD 
this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow ,COMMA or even survive ,COMMA in palestine .PERIOD 
violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ;SEMICOLON they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .PERIOD 
if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue ,COMMA it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight .PERIOD 
the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room .PERIOD 
the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit .PERIOD 
the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior ,COMMA since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it .PERIOD 
parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children .PERIOD 
but that's true for adults too .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced ,COMMA depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .PERIOD 
i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today .PERIOD 
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank ,COMMA in gaza and in east jerusalem ,COMMA i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation .PERIOD 
in a village called wallajeh ,COMMA which sits very close to jerusalem ,COMMA the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus .PERIOD 
they were going to be surrounded ,COMMA lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access ,COMMA either to the west bank or jerusalem .PERIOD 
so we organized a screening .PERIOD 
the organizers say that the villagers ,COMMA upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film ,COMMA felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing ,COMMA that people cared .PERIOD 
so they kept on going .PERIOD 
on the israeli side ,COMMA there is a new peace movement called solidariot ,COMMA which means solidarity in hebrew .PERIOD 
the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools .PERIOD 
they report that israelis who had never been active before ,COMMA upon seeing the film ,COMMA understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities .PERIOD 
the examples of wallajeh and the solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior .PERIOD 
now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bil'in ,COMMA ni'lin ,COMMA wallajeh ,COMMA in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible ,COMMA valued and effective in their work .PERIOD 
i believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts ,COMMA they are invisible ,COMMA and it's as if they never happened .PERIOD 
but i have seen first hand that if we do ,COMMA they will multiply .PERIOD 
if they multiply ,COMMA their influence will grow in the overall israeli-palestinian conflict .PERIOD 
and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation .PERIOD 
these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus .PERIOD 
let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere .PERIOD 
thank you .PERIOD 
when we park in a big parking lot ,COMMA how do we remember where we parked our car ?QUESTIONMARK 
here's the problem facing homer .PERIOD 
and we're going to try to understand what's happening in his brain .PERIOD 
so we'll start with the hippocampus ,COMMA shown in yellow ,COMMA which is the organ of memory .PERIOD 
if you have damage there ,COMMA like in alzheimer's ,COMMA you can't remember things including where you parked your car .PERIOD 
it's named after latin for seahorse ,COMMA which it resembles .PERIOD 
and like the rest of the brain ,COMMA it's made of neurons .PERIOD 
and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other .PERIOD 
the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells ,COMMA which are very densely interconnected .PERIOD 
and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food .PERIOD 
so we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here .PERIOD 
and when it fires a little spike of electricity ,COMMA there's going to be a red dot and a click .PERIOD 
so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .PERIOD 
and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike .PERIOD 
so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal's location .PERIOD 
and if we record from lots of different neurons ,COMMA we'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment ,COMMA like in this square box shown here .PERIOD 
so together they form a map for the rest of the brain ,COMMA telling the brain continually ,COMMA where am i now within my environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
place cells are also being recorded in humans .PERIOD 
so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .PERIOD 
and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .PERIOD 
and place cells in their hippocampi would fire ,COMMA become active ,COMMA start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town .PERIOD 
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important .PERIOD 
so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat's in .PERIOD 
and when you expand the box ,COMMA the firing location expands .PERIOD 
the one below likes to fire whenever there's a wall close by to the south .PERIOD 
and if you put another wall inside the box ,COMMA then the cell fires in both place wherever there's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box .PERIOD 
so this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA on the inputs to the hippocampus ,COMMA cells are found which project into the hippocampus ,COMMA which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around .PERIOD 
so the cell on the left ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east ,COMMA whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table ,COMMA which the animals are running around .PERIOD 
and the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south ,COMMA whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart .PERIOD 
so that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around .PERIOD 
we can also test where we think objects are ,COMMA like this goal flag ,COMMA in simple environments -- or indeed ,COMMA where your car would be .PERIOD 
so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember .PERIOD 
and then ,COMMA if we put them back in the environment ,COMMA generally they're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was .PERIOD 
but on some trials ,COMMA we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell .PERIOD 
in that case ,COMMA we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment .PERIOD 
and what you see ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment ,COMMA and then if you ask people where it was ,COMMA but you've made the environment bigger ,COMMA where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out .PERIOD 
it's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location ,COMMA and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern .PERIOD 
that guides you back to the location that you want to remember .PERIOD 
but we also know where we are through movement .PERIOD 
so if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements ,COMMA which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .PERIOD 
and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .PERIOD 
now grid cells are found ,COMMA again ,COMMA on the inputs to the hippocampus ,COMMA and they're a bit like place cells .PERIOD 
but now as the rat explores around ,COMMA each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid .PERIOD 
and if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment ,COMMA and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells .PERIOD 
so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one .PERIOD 
so together ,COMMA it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map ,COMMA but using triangles .PERIOD 
and as it moves around ,COMMA the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is ,COMMA so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment .PERIOD 
do people have grid cells ?QUESTIONMARK 
well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry ,COMMA the same orientations of grid ,COMMA shown in orange here ,COMMA it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between .PERIOD 
so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal .PERIOD 
and indeed ,COMMA you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex ,COMMA which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .PERIOD 
so back to homer .PERIOD 
he's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .PERIOD 
and that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .PERIOD 
he's also remembering the path he took out of the car park ,COMMA which would be represented in the firing of grid cells .PERIOD 
now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire .PERIOD 
and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car .PERIOD 
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there .PERIOD 
maybe it's been towed .PERIOD 
but he knows where it was ,COMMA so he knows to go and get it .PERIOD 
so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene ,COMMA at least ,COMMA of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them .PERIOD 
so if this was happening ,COMMA your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint .PERIOD 
and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .PERIOD 
another kind of cell ,COMMA head direction cells ,COMMA which i didn't mention yet ,COMMA they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing .PERIOD 
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery ,COMMA so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD 
how do you explain when things don't go as we assume ?QUESTIONMARK 
for example :COLON why is apple so innovative ?QUESTIONMARK 
year after year ,COMMA after year ,COMMA after year ,COMMA they're more innovative than all their competition .PERIOD 
and yet ,COMMA they're just a computer company .PERIOD 
they're just like everyone else .PERIOD 
they have the same access to the same talent ,COMMA the same agencies ,COMMA the same consultants ,COMMA the same media .PERIOD 
then why is it that they seem to have something different ?QUESTIONMARK 
why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement ?QUESTIONMARK 
he wasn't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights america ,COMMA and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day .PERIOD 
why him ?QUESTIONMARK 
and why is it that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled ,COMMA powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified ,COMMA better funded . .PERIOD 
and they didn't achieve powered man flight ,COMMA and the wright brothers beat them to it .PERIOD 
there's something else at play here .PERIOD 
about three and a half years ago i made a discovery .PERIOD 
and this discovery profoundly changed my view on how i thought the world worked ,COMMA and it even profoundly changed the way in which i operate in it .PERIOD 
as it turns out ,COMMA there's a pattern .PERIOD 
as it turns out ,COMMA all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it's apple or martin luther king or the wright brothers -- they all think ,COMMA act and communicate the exact same way .PERIOD 
and it's the complete opposite to everyone else .PERIOD 
all i did was codify it ,COMMA and it's probably the world's simplest idea .PERIOD 
i call it the golden circle .PERIOD 
this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't .PERIOD 
let me define the terms really quickly .PERIOD 
every single person ,COMMA every single organization on the planet knows what they do ,COMMA <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
some know how they do it ,COMMA whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your usp .PERIOD 
but very ,COMMA very few people or organizations know why they do what they do .PERIOD 
and by why i don't mean to make a profit .PERIOD 
that's a result .PERIOD it's always a result .PERIOD 
by why ,COMMA i mean :COLON what's your purpose ?QUESTIONMARK 
what's your cause ?QUESTIONMARK what's your belief ?QUESTIONMARK 
why does your organization exist ?QUESTIONMARK 
why do you get out of bed in the morning ?QUESTIONMARK 
and why should anyone care ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA as a result ,COMMA the way we think ,COMMA the way we act ,COMMA the way we communicate is from the outside in .PERIOD 
it's obvious .PERIOD we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing .PERIOD 
but the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size ,COMMA regardless of their industry -- all think ,COMMA act and communicate from the inside out .PERIOD 
let me give you an example .PERIOD 
i use apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it .PERIOD 
if apple were like everyone else ,COMMA a marketing message from them might sound like this :COLON we make great computers .PERIOD 
they're beautifully designed ,COMMA simple to use and user friendly .PERIOD 
want to buy one ?QUESTIONMARK meh .PERIOD 
and that's how most of us communicate .PERIOD 
that's how most marketing is done ,COMMA that's how most sales is done and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally .PERIOD 
here's our new law firm :COLON we have the best lawyers with the biggest clients ,COMMA we always perform for our clients who do business with us .PERIOD 
here's our new car :COLON it gets great gas mileage ,COMMA it has leather seats ,COMMA buy our car .PERIOD 
but it's uninspiring .PERIOD 
here's how apple actually communicates .PERIOD 
everything we do ,COMMA we believe in challenging the status quo .PERIOD 
we believe in thinking differently .PERIOD 
the way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed ,COMMA simple to use and user friendly .PERIOD 
we just happen to make great computers .PERIOD 
want to buy one ?QUESTIONMARK 
totally different right ?QUESTIONMARK you're ready to buy a computer from me .PERIOD 
what it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON people buy why you do it .PERIOD 
people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON they buy why you do it .PERIOD 
this explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from apple .PERIOD 
but we're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple ,COMMA or a phone from apple ,COMMA or a dvr from apple .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA as i said before ,COMMA apple's just a computer company .PERIOD 
there's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors .PERIOD 
their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA they tried .PERIOD 
a few years ago ,COMMA gateway came out with flat screen tvs .PERIOD 
they're eminently qualified to make flat screen tvs .PERIOD 
they've been making flat screen monitors for years .PERIOD 
nobody bought one .PERIOD 
dell came out with mp3 players and pdas ,COMMA and they make great quality products ,COMMA and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA talking about it now ,COMMA we can't even imagine buying an mp3 player from dell .PERIOD 
why would you buy an mp3 player from a computer company ?QUESTIONMARK 
but we do it every day .PERIOD 
people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON they buy why you do it .PERIOD 
the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have .PERIOD 
the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe .PERIOD 
here's the best part :COLON none of what i'm telling you is my opinion .PERIOD 
it's all grounded in the tenets of biology .PERIOD 
not psychology ,COMMA biology .PERIOD 
if you look at a cross-section of the human brain ,COMMA looking from the top down ,COMMA what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle .PERIOD 
our newest brain ,COMMA our homo sapien brain ,COMMA our neocortex ,COMMA corresponds with the what level .PERIOD 
the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .PERIOD 
the middle two sections make up our limbic brains ,COMMA and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings ,COMMA like trust and loyalty .PERIOD 
it's also responsible for all human behavior ,COMMA all decision-making ,COMMA and it has no capacity for language .PERIOD 
it just doesn't drive behavior .PERIOD 
this is where gut decisions come from .PERIOD 
you know ,COMMA sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures ,COMMA and they say ,COMMA i know what all the facts and details say ,COMMA but it just doesn't feel right .PERIOD 
why would we use that verb ,COMMA it doesn't feel right ?QUESTIONMARK 
because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language .PERIOD 
and the best we can muster up is ,COMMA i don't know .PERIOD it just doesn't feel right .PERIOD 
or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart ,COMMA or you're leading with your soul .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA i hate to break it to you ,COMMA those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior .PERIOD 
it's all happening here in your limbic brain ,COMMA the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language .PERIOD 
but if you don't know why you do what you do ,COMMA and people respond to why you do what you do ,COMMA then how will you ever get people to vote for you ,COMMA or buy something from you ,COMMA or ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do .PERIOD 
again ,COMMA the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ;SEMICOLON the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe .PERIOD 
the goal is not just to hire people who need a job ;SEMICOLON it's to hire people who believe what you believe .PERIOD 
i always say that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you hire people just because they can do a job ,COMMA they'll work for your money ,COMMA but if you hire people who believe what you believe ,COMMA they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears .PERIOD 
and nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the wright brothers .PERIOD 
most people don't know about samuel pierpont langley .PERIOD 
and back in the early 20th century ,COMMA the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day .PERIOD 
everybody was trying it .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA even now ,COMMA you ask people ,COMMA why did your product or why did your company fail ?QUESTIONMARK 
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things :COLON under-capitalized ,COMMA the wrong people ,COMMA bad market conditions .PERIOD 
it's always the same three things ,COMMA so let's explore that .PERIOD 
samuel pierpont langley was given <NUM> dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine .PERIOD 
money was no problem .PERIOD 
he held a seat at harvard and worked at the smithsonian and was extremely well-connected ;SEMICOLON he knew all the big minds of the day .PERIOD 
he hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .PERIOD 
the new york times followed him around everywhere ,COMMA and everyone was rooting for langley .PERIOD 
then how come we've never heard of samuel pierpont langley ?QUESTIONMARK 
a few hundred miles away in dayton ohio ,COMMA orville and wilbur wright ,COMMA they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success .PERIOD 
they had no money ;SEMICOLON they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop ;SEMICOLON not a single person on the wright brothers' team had a college education ,COMMA not even orville or wilbur ;SEMICOLON and the new york times followed them around nowhere .PERIOD 
the difference was ,COMMA orville and wilbur were driven by a cause ,COMMA by a purpose ,COMMA by a belief .PERIOD 
they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine ,COMMA it'll change the course of the world .PERIOD 
samuel pierpont langley was different .PERIOD 
he wanted to be rich ,COMMA and he wanted to be famous .PERIOD 
he was in pursuit of the result .PERIOD 
he was in pursuit of the riches .PERIOD 
and lo and behold ,COMMA look what happened .PERIOD 
the people who believed in the wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears .PERIOD 
the others just worked for the paycheck .PERIOD 
and they tell stories of how every time the wright brothers went out ,COMMA they would have to take five sets of parts ,COMMA because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA on december 17th ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA the wright brothers took flight ,COMMA and no one was there to even experience it .PERIOD 
we found out about it a few days later .PERIOD 
and further proof that langley was motivated by the wrong thing :COLON the day the wright brothers took flight ,COMMA he quit .PERIOD 
he could have said ,COMMA that's an amazing discovery ,COMMA guys ,COMMA and i will improve upon your technology ,COMMA but he didn't .PERIOD 
he wasn't first ,COMMA he didn't get rich ,COMMA he didn't get famous so he quit .PERIOD 
people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON they buy why you do it .PERIOD 
and if you talk about what you believe ,COMMA you will attract those who believe what you believe .PERIOD 
but why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?QUESTIONMARK 
something called the law of diffusion of innovation ,COMMA and if you don't know the law ,COMMA you definitely know the terminology .PERIOD 
the first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators .PERIOD 
the next <NUM> and a half percent of our population are our early adopters .PERIOD 
the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore .PERIOD 
we all sit at various places at various times on this scale ,COMMA but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea ,COMMA you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between <NUM> and <NUM> percent market penetration ,COMMA and then the system tips .PERIOD 
and i love asking businesses ,COMMA what's your conversion on new business ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they love to tell you ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's about <NUM> percent ,COMMA proudly .PERIOD 
well ,COMMA you can trip over <NUM> percent of the customers .PERIOD 
we all have about <NUM> percent who just get it .PERIOD 
that's how we describe them ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
that's like that gut feeling ,COMMA oh ,COMMA they just get it .PERIOD 
so it's this here ,COMMA this little gap that you have to close ,COMMA as jeffrey moore calls it ,COMMA crossing the chasm -- because ,COMMA you see ,COMMA the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first .PERIOD 
and these guys ,COMMA the innovators and the early adopters ,COMMA they're comfortable making those gut decisions .PERIOD 
they're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available .PERIOD 
these are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iphone when they first came out ,COMMA when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf .PERIOD 
these are the people who spent <NUM> dollars on flat screen tvs when they first came out ,COMMA even though the technology was substandard .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA they didn't do it because the technology was so great ;SEMICOLON they did it for themselves .PERIOD 
it's because they wanted to be first .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA people will do the things that prove what they believe .PERIOD 
the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours ,COMMA stood in line for six hours ,COMMA was because of what they believed about the world ,COMMA and how they wanted everybody to see them :COLON they were first .PERIOD 
people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON they buy why you do it .PERIOD 
so let me give you a famous example ,COMMA a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation .PERIOD 
first ,COMMA the famous failure .PERIOD 
it's a commercial example .PERIOD 
as we said before ,COMMA a second ago ,COMMA the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK you should have success then .PERIOD 
look at tivo .PERIOD 
from the time tivo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day ,COMMA they are the single highest-quality product on the market ,COMMA hands down ,COMMA there is no dispute .PERIOD 
market conditions were fantastic .PERIOD 
i mean ,COMMA we use tivo as verb .PERIOD 
i tivo stuff on my piece of junk time warner dvr all the time .PERIOD 
but tivo's a commercial failure .PERIOD 
they've never made money .PERIOD 
and when they went ipo ,COMMA their stock was at about <NUM> or <NUM> dollars and then plummeted ,COMMA and it's never traded above <NUM> .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA i don't think it's even traded above six ,COMMA except for a couple of little spikes .PERIOD 
because you see ,COMMA when tivo launched their product they told us all what they had .PERIOD 
they said ,COMMA we have a product that pauses live tv ,COMMA skips commercials ,COMMA rewinds live tv and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking .PERIOD 
and the cynical majority said ,COMMA we don't believe you .PERIOD 
we don't need it .PERIOD we don't like it .PERIOD 
you're scaring us .PERIOD 
what if they had said ,COMMA if you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life ,COMMA boy ,COMMA do we have a product for you .PERIOD 
it pauses live tv ,COMMA skips commercials ,COMMA memorizes your viewing habits ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
people don't buy what you do ;SEMICOLON they buy why you do it ,COMMA and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe .PERIOD 
now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation .PERIOD 
they sent out no invitations ,COMMA and there was no website to check the date .PERIOD 
how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
well ,COMMA dr .PERIOD king wasn't the only man in america who was a great orator .PERIOD 
he wasn't the only man in america who suffered in a pre-civil rights america .PERIOD 
in fact ,COMMA some of his ideas were bad .PERIOD 
but he had a gift .PERIOD 
he didn't go around telling people what needed to change in america .PERIOD 
he went around and told people what he believed .PERIOD 
i believe ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA he told people .PERIOD 
and people who believed what he believed took his cause ,COMMA and they made it their own ,COMMA and they told people .PERIOD 
and some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people .PERIOD 
and lo and behold ,COMMA <NUM> people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak .PERIOD 
how many of them showed up for him ?QUESTIONMARK 
zero .PERIOD 
they showed up for themselves .PERIOD 
it's what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of august .PERIOD 
it's what they believed ,COMMA and it wasn't about black versus white :COLON <NUM> percent of the audience was white .PERIOD 
dr .PERIOD king believed that there are two types of laws in this world :COLON those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man .PERIOD 
and not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world .PERIOD 
it just so happened that the civil rights movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life .PERIOD 
we followed ,COMMA not for him ,COMMA but for ourselves .PERIOD 
and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA he gave the i have a dream speech ,COMMA not the i have a plan speech .PERIOD 
listen to politicians now ,COMMA with their comprehensive 12-point plans .PERIOD 
they're not inspiring anybody .PERIOD 
leaders hold a position of power or authority ,COMMA but those who lead inspire us .PERIOD 
whether they're individuals or organizations ,COMMA we follow those who lead ,COMMA not because we have to ,COMMA but because we want to .PERIOD 
we follow those who lead ,COMMA not for them ,COMMA but for ourselves .PERIOD 
and it's those who start with why that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .PERIOD 
thank you very much .PERIOD

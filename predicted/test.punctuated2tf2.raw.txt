It can be a very complicated thing ,COMMA the ocean 
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .PERIOD 
People working in these canneries could barely stay there all day because of the smell ,COMMA but you know what they came out saying 
We made the ocean unhappy .PERIOD we made people very unhappy ,COMMA and we made them unhealthy 
We see the base of the food chain ,COMMA the plankton ,COMMA the small things ,COMMA and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid and on .PERIOD so up this diagram 
Now a dolphin mother dolphin any dolphin -- there's only one way that a pcb can ,COMMA get out of a dolphin 
And what's that 
Here's a diagram of the pcb load of dolphins in sarasota bay ,COMMA 
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places 
That's a tragedy for those populations ,COMMA but it's also a tragedy for the people eating them ,COMMA because they don't know that that's toxic meat .PERIOD 
These same infections create harmful algal blooms .PERIOD 
I started out showing how much we had distressed the monterey bay ecosystem with pollution and the canning industry .PERIOD and all of the attendant problems .PERIOD 
It's an ocean planet ,COMMA and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species ,COMMA but the pyramid of life in the ocean ,COMMA and our own lives on land are intricately connected .PERIOD 
It's a huge driver for culture ,COMMA and i think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior .PERIOD 
The people in these studies report ,COMMA feeling so awake during the daytime that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .PERIOD 
So cut to the modern day 
Okay ,COMMA we'll do something with it 
Puppets always have to try to be alive 
It's their kind of ur-story onstage ,COMMA that desperation to live 
His mother was a puppeteer 
And in fact ,COMMA it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali ,COMMA in west africa ,COMMA where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry ,COMMA to learn a renewed ,COMMA or a new respect ,COMMA for this art form ,COMMA 
So we made a model 
And we had a crate built for it 
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town ,COMMA and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet ,COMMA 
A month later ,COMMA we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us 
And we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely 
And here is our factory in cape town ,COMMA where we make horses 
I'd just like to describe -- i won't talk too loud .PERIOD he might get irritated 
The ears are ,COMMA obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse 
When they point right back ,COMMA the horse is fearful or angry ,COMMA depending upon what's going on in front of him around him .PERIOD 
The hind legs have got the same action 
And mikey also has in his fingers ,COMMA the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and down with the other hand ,COMMA 
And together ,COMMA there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression 
And it's very ,COMMA very simple ,COMMA because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees 
But of course it was the cane is light .PERIOD the cane is flexible ,COMMA the cane is durable and the cane is moldable .PERIOD 
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders ,COMMA like many of the people here by new tools ,COMMA like the ones we've seen here ,COMMA and by new pressures 
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA this may surprise you 
Now we have wikipedia 
Suddenly big things can be done for love 
Take a look ,COMMA if you haven't at donorschoose 
The third category is represented by warren buffet ,COMMA which i call aggregated giving 
It's that he challenged another assumption ,COMMA that every giver should have his or her own fund or foundation ,COMMA 
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things 
And that's where my imagined future comes in ,COMMA which i am going to call the social singularity .PERIOD 
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme 
That's why i have one last thing i want to show you 
And they were great community leaders 
I keep this photograph close by to me -- it's in my office -- because i've always felt a mystical connection to these .PERIOD two men ,COMMA both of whom i never knew 
And i want you to imagine that it's 100 years from now .PERIOD and your grandchild ,COMMA or great-grandchild ,COMMA or niece or nephew or god-child ,COMMA is looking at this photograph of you 
And what do i mean by that 
And i asked them to come along with the person .PERIOD they communicate with most 
What we're actually going to see is that fundamentally people are communicating on a regular basis with five six ,COMMA seven of their most intimate sphere .PERIOD 
He just wants to wish her a good day ,COMMA because that's the start of her day .PERIOD 
They chat to each other every day a few times a day ,COMMA actually ,COMMA 
But it could be in a school ,COMMA it could be an administration .PERIOD it could be a hospital 
If you were not you maybe had to go through an operator 
The phones were there ,COMMA but the expectation was once you moved in there ,COMMA your commitment was fully to the task at hand ,COMMA fully to the people around you 
This only started about 150 years ago ,COMMA 
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working 
Companies blocking access to im ,COMMA or to facebook ,COMMA 
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference 
Now two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months .PERIOD and only for about a few years' worth of coal 
Now judy ,COMMA and i -- i have to say -- totally related to each other 
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together and totally understand that this is what it's all about 
And we know that eco-industrial business ,COMMA these kinds of business models -- there's a model in europe called the eco-industrial park ,COMMA where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another ,COMMA or you use recycled materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell 
And in my hometown ,COMMA we actually tried to do one of these in the bronx ,COMMA but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .PERIOD 
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can't meet the year-round demand for produce 
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .PERIOD 
The recession has us reeling and fearful ,COMMA and there's something in the air these days that is also very empowering 
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding 
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people 
Hometown security is next on my to-do list ,COMMA 
The first few systems that we created ,COMMA they kind of worked 
So she expresses here what it's like to see someone halfway across the world ,COMMA having taken your idea built upon it and then acknowledging you for contributing 
And he was a clever man ,COMMA he sort of said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's ok .PERIOD but you've done very well .PERIOD in your math sats 
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning ,COMMA without the permission of the company ,COMMA 
This picture was taken in 1982 just before the ibm pc was even announced 
And when people tell me who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids 
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently ,COMMA and when they debug the programs ,COMMA they come the closest to learning about learning 
This is in the early 2000s ,COMMA my son ,COMMA dimitri -- who's here ,COMMA many of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA dimitri -- went to cambodia set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the internet .PERIOD 
I can see any head of state any executive i want at any time ,COMMA because i'm not selling laptops .PERIOD ok ,COMMA i have no shareholders 
If you look at our professional services ,COMMA including search firms ,COMMA including communications ,COMMA including legal services ,COMMA including banking ,COMMA they're all pro bono .PERIOD and it's not to save money .PERIOD 
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic 
And that was really critical .PERIOD the mesh network ,COMMA it'll become commonplace .PERIOD 
It wasn't just to kind of make it cute .PERIOD because somebody -- you know ,COMMA good design is very important .PERIOD 
If you're in a desert ,COMMA they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .PERIOD 
Use your mailing lists people in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .PERIOD 
And the world production today ,COMMA everybody combined making laptops is five million a month .PERIOD so i'm standing here ,COMMA telling you that sometime next year ,COMMA we're going to make 20 percent of the world production .PERIOD 
Computers sort of came around through games and toys 
And you know ,COMMA the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play pong a little microprocessor embedded .PERIOD and then other games that came after that 
Yeah ,COMMA there's 38 million of them sold worldwide ,COMMA 
Don't worry ,COMMA relax ,COMMA no ,COMMA relax .PERIOD it's a robot .PERIOD it's smart 
It can withstand a 400g shock ,COMMA the robot has local intelligence .PERIOD it can flip itself over can get itself into communication range can go upstairs by itself ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD 
We had the robots down at the world trade center ,COMMA late that evening 
So one year ago ,COMMA the us military didn't have these robots 
He sort of does that ,COMMA but i'm going to -- chris anderson :COLON i'm just british rb .PERIOD oh 
Okay ,COMMA he's pretty good .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD good .PERIOD good .PERIOD good .PERIOD 
And at different places in that space ,COMMA it expresses -- can we have the volume on here 
Kismet ?QUESTIONMARK do you really think ?QUESTIONMARK so do you really think ?QUESTIONMARK so 
Voice look at my smile 
Voice ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA you're not to do that .PERIOD no 
We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot -- notice the turn-taking 
After all ,COMMA that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us 
And for those of you that have teenagers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what that's like 
And i don't think -- -- i don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with 
And the watchmaker turned around and said ,COMMA god can see it 
But i felt something 
Now ,COMMA you probably know the answer to this already 
I remember it clearly 
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA what the hell's that about 
Now i'm not a neuroscientist 
And how much of that reactive side of it is due to what we already know ,COMMA or what we're going to learn about something 
And as we assemble these tools from a design point of view ,COMMA i get terribly excited about it because these are things as we've already said ,COMMA they're arriving at the brain ,COMMA it would seem before cognition ,COMMA before we can manipulate them -- electrochemical party tricks ,COMMA 
Now when talking about beauty ,COMMA you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces .PERIOD and what have you 
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow .PERIOD 
Anais nin .PERIOD and the talmud have told us time and time again ,COMMA that we see things not as they are ,COMMA but as we are 
Ahhhh 
But i also know why it's exquisite to me ,COMMA because it's a palimpsest of things 
I mean ,COMMA if i just go through some of them now -- i know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects ,COMMA and that does it consummately well ,COMMA you can see it can 
Why would you do that 
Beautiful maybe lesser 
Underneath this ,COMMA like the story of the swan ,COMMA is a million things very difficult to do 
So all hail to that ,COMMA 
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside ,COMMA the stuff that costs nothing because that knowledge is free -- bundle that together .PERIOD and where do we come out 
And so i've stopped using words like form ,COMMA and i've stopped using words like function as a designer 
And for the last decade ,COMMA or so ,COMMA it's been quite clear .PERIOD what being an atheist means 
Now i think it's too easy 
And what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like a new version of atheism ,COMMA we could call atheism 20 
I really like the art of mantegna 
I think there is an alternative 
We have secularized badly ,COMMA i would argue 
You know ,COMMA the kind of thing a commencement address is ,COMMA and graduation ceremonies ,COMMA those lyrical claims that education ,COMMA the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .PERIOD 
We need data ,COMMA we don't need help 
And so we need guidance ,COMMA and we need didactic learning .PERIOD 
They'd go ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't need one of those 
Well ,COMMA a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information 
Otherwise our minds are like sieves 
We associate repetition with boredom ,COMMA 
We're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they're so true .PERIOD 
The other things that religions do is to arrange time ,COMMA 
All the major religions give us calendars ,COMMA 
You won't do that by accident ,COMMA you will do that ,COMMA because you are guided to do that 
In the secular world ,COMMA we think if an idea is important ,COMMA i'll bump into it 
That's very good 
In the secular world ,COMMA you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker ,COMMA and still have a great career 
What you're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it 
After every convincing point ,COMMA people will go ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen .PERIOD 
At the end of a really rousing paragraph ,COMMA they'll all stand up and they'll go .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD jesus .PERIOD thank you christ .PERIOD thank you savior .PERIOD 
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two 
We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals .PERIOD or our new .PERIOD churches .PERIOD 
Art is about two things in all the major faiths ,COMMA 
And if that thing is good ,COMMA there's no problem with it at all 
Art should be didactic 
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists ,COMMA the poets -- are on their own ,COMMA and they have no power .PERIOD they have no might 
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from ,COMMA which is this sense -- that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious -- of spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that's bigger than you are 
Is there any room for that experience in atheism 20 
I would say that there are many many gaps in secular life ,COMMA and these can be plugged 
And as it happened ,COMMA i read it from midnight to five in the morning ,COMMA in one shot ,COMMA 
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world 
There is another way to search for dark matter ,COMMA which is indirectly ,COMMA 
When a neutrino hits a water molecule ,COMMA it emits a kind of blue light ,COMMA a flash of blue light .PERIOD and by looking for this blue light ,COMMA you can essentially understand something about the neutrino ,COMMA and then ,COMMA indirectly ,COMMA something about the dark matter that might have created .PERIOD this neutrino ,COMMA 
But nonetheless ,COMMA it's an extraordinary piece of engineering 
Here's another view of the same 
The reason why you have to build these telescopes in places like the atacama desert is because of the high altitude desert 
And remember all this wiring is being done by people in extreme cold ,COMMA in sub-zero temperatures 
They're wearing about 15 kg ,COMMA of clothing and stuff ,COMMA but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that 
Anil ananthaswamy ,COMMA and i'll finally like to leave you with two images 
They're going to learn from whatever it is ,COMMA they have around them 
It is by far and away the largest print library in the world .PERIOD 
Then the question is ?QUESTIONMARK what do you get 
It's starting to be a little bit more specified 
But i have to say that there's older technologies that i tend to like 
And it turns out to not be very hard 
You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page ,COMMA sort of the parts cost for doing this 
And so we've tried that ,COMMA and i'll go over that in a moment ,COMMA 
And it's called the espresso book machine .PERIOD and in about 10 minutes ,COMMA you can press a button and make a book 
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop 
If you really care about books ,COMMA you're going to scan them better ,COMMA especially if they're valuable books 
So all in all ,COMMA that's going very well .PERIOD 
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works ,COMMA but loaning them 
But it is within our grasp ,COMMA technologically and law-wise ,COMMA at least for the out of print and out of copyright .PERIOD we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing ,COMMA online 
It's sort of the biggest tivo box you've ever seen 
It's about a petabyte ,COMMA so far of worldwide television -- russian chinese japanese iraqi al jazeera .PERIOD bbc .PERIOD cnn ,COMMA abc ,COMMA cbs ,COMMA nbc -- 24 hours a day ,COMMA 
So we've got about 100000 pieces up there 
And actually ,COMMA it's really been pioneered by alexa internet ,COMMA which donates this collection to the internet archive .PERIOD 
If we go and put it in a couple more places ,COMMA i think we'll be in good shape .PERIOD 
You'll eat ,COMMA countless gourmet meals 
Not likely 
And this and then this 
Day 21 day 23 day 25 
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria .PERIOD and so our best antibiotics come from fungi 
How is that possible ,COMMA 
The tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet 
The earth was struck by an asteroid ,COMMA a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere 
We were involved with several experiments .PERIOD 
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste .PERIOD one was a control pile .PERIOD one pile was treated with enzymes .PERIOD one pile was treated with bacteria .PERIOD and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium 
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds 
So i invented burlap sacks ,COMMA bunker spawn -- and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris ,COMMA you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream from a farm that's producing e .PERIOD coli ,COMMA or other wastes ,COMMA or a factory with chemical toxins ,COMMA and it leads to habitat restoration .PERIOD 
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram ,COMMA and 10 to the third power is around .PERIOD 1000 
In 48 hours to 72 hours ,COMMA these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10000 times 
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year 
So this one mushroom in particular has drawn our interest over time 
And a few years ago we received these results 
10 or greater are considered to be very active 
And so for the first time i am showing this 
And we're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical 
So i went to the epa homepage ,COMMA and they were recommending studies with metarhizium species of a group of fungi that kill carpenter ants as well as termites .PERIOD 
The life box -- you're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil ,COMMA you add water ,COMMA you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well .PERIOD as spores ,COMMA like of the agarikon mushroom 
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium 
I've also lived in biosphere 2 
Well in 1991 ,COMMA it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby ,COMMA 
The day i walked into biosphere 2 ,COMMA i was for the first time ,COMMA breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world ,COMMA except seven other people 
We were taking their biomass ,COMMA storing them in the basement ,COMMA growing plants ,COMMA going around around around trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
And we had no clue where it was 
And that you literally do that you stop breathing ,COMMA and then you -- -- take a breath .PERIOD and it wakes you up ,COMMA and it's very irritating 
And i recoiled ,COMMA they stank 
People stink .PERIOD 
I had no idea what was in my food where it came from 
And so we sent one onto the mir space station .PERIOD 
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth .PERIOD frankly ,COMMA from an environmental point of view ,COMMA 
And understand its interactions with the entire earth ,COMMA 
Now it may not seem like it ,COMMA but we are 
Thank you 
What i'd like you to do is just really quickly is just sort of ,COMMA nod to the person on your right .PERIOD and then nod to the person on your left 
And one documentary writer ,COMMA who was here and looked at this two months after i was here described this not as beehives ,COMMA but as a graveyard ,COMMA with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .PERIOD 
It was called that because a guy in israel ,COMMA first found it ,COMMA and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease .PERIOD because of course there's the implication 
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on .PERIOD he was so capable .PERIOD he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax i have ever seen from cow dung ,COMMA tin cans and his veil ,COMMA which he used as a screening right in this meadow .PERIOD and so that ingenuity is inspiring 
And we see these families these nomadic families ,COMMA you know ,COMMA father to son ,COMMA father to son .PERIOD and these guys are hurting 
We have bumblebees on the top 
Dennis vanengelsdorp bee ,COMMA okay .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA there is now a red list of pollinators that we're worried have disappeared .PERIOD and on top of that list are a lot of these kleptoparasites ,COMMA but also these bumblebees 
There are other animals that pollinate like bats .PERIOD and bats are in trouble too ,COMMA 
But i'm glad to say that i think we know the cause of all these conditions ,COMMA and that cause is ndd .PERIOD nature deficit disorder 
And that is make meadows .PERIOD and not lawns 
Now not all of us have meadows ,COMMA or lawns that we can convert .PERIOD and so you can always ,COMMA of course ,COMMA grow a meadow in a pot .PERIOD 
And everyone should open a beehive ,COMMA because it is the most amazing incredible thing 
And if we want to cure ourselves of ndd or nature deficit disorder ,COMMA i think this is a great way of doing it 
She googled .PERIOD and she found this world whistling championship in america .PERIOD of course ,COMMA 
Okay ,COMMA i'm not the only one whistling here 
And i want to first rehearse with you your whistling 
I start it myself 
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark .PERIOD that's not reported here 
So now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently ,COMMA or at least for a very long period .PERIOD and no one is taking care of plants .PERIOD 
Why 
This is not the common man 
You know ,COMMA very well ,COMMA about professors 
When he speaks about animals ,COMMA [he] tends to remove the fact that plants exist 
The blue whale ,COMMA the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong completely wrong .PERIOD 
Some of them are much more sophisticated 
Many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination ,COMMA but not just insects ,COMMA even birds ,COMMA reptiles and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen .PERIOD 
This is a serious business 
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted in blue -- that is ,COMMA called the transition zone .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature ,COMMA but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye ,COMMA 
They work in the same way ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA if you want to fly ,COMMA it's good that you look at birds -- to be inspired by birds 
But if you want to explore soils ,COMMA or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this 
It's much more easy to work with plants than with animals 
Thank you 
She's being filmed with a hidden camera 
So she's noticed the unusual thing ,COMMA but she's gone back to her normal life 
And we've continued to do it every year 
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 ,COMMA total windows -- and i knew what i had to do 
So then i gave a new hand signal ,COMMA which signaled the next soloist down below in forever ,COMMA 21 .PERIOD and he danced 
This is the best buy in new york city 
And it's a very depressing place to be in the morning .PERIOD it's very crowded 
The participants at improv everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other new yorkers ,COMMA they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .PERIOD 
And i think that's sort of the point of improv everywhere ,COMMA 
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies ,COMMA and how bad the situation would get 
It doesn't require any special training 
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal 
They have become domesticated ,COMMA and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years .PERIOD 
Because what i've been doing for the last four years ,COMMA really ,COMMA since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion ,COMMA and in the last four years ,COMMA i've been working just about non-stop on this topic .PERIOD 
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions 
And as with the cow ,COMMA there's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions 
It's like a coin flip ,COMMA it doesn't count really 
Is it totalitarian to require ,COMMA reading ,COMMA writing and arithmetic .PERIOD 
I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths ,COMMA 
This picture ,COMMA which i pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .PERIOD 
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all 
If you understand orgel's second rule ,COMMA then you understand why the intelligent design movement is basically a hoax ,COMMA 
Again ,COMMA and again ,COMMA biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered 
But the process itself is without purpose ,COMMA without foresight ,COMMA without design .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was -- needed to get into the belly of a sheep ,COMMA or a cow in order to reproduce 
The key to our domination of the planet is culture .PERIOD and the key to culture is religion ,COMMA 
They'd want to know how it originated ,COMMA what it was for and how it perpetuates itself 
In that case a parasite gets into a mouse ,COMMA and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .PERIOD 
But i'm not just talking about islam 
I'm talking also about christianity ,COMMA 
You've all got a copy 
You've just heard the man 
First of all the goal 
The book is clear ,COMMA vivid accessible ;SEMICOLON beautifully formatted .PERIOD 
Just enough repetition 
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems 
That's worth mentioning 
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning ,COMMA or significance ,COMMA 
But that is just a difference of opinion ,COMMA 
That's not what i'm really worried about 
And here ,COMMA i think ,COMMA wait a minute 
Is he endorsing creationism here 
Your mind can handle 15000 decisions a second 
Well ,COMMA there's a sense which i agree with him ,COMMA except i think it has an evolutionary explanation .PERIOD 
Whose truth are we going to listen to 
And here's one that does concern me 
And i'd really like to get a response ,COMMA if rick is able to do it 
A very clever little meme 
In fact ,COMMA all of you ,COMMA as you sit here ,COMMA right now are vibrating .PERIOD 
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies ,COMMA 
It looks a bit like this 
The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues .PERIOD 
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data 
You're having to imagine it 
Professional hearing protectors are great .PERIOD i use some all the time 
The elizabethans described language as decorated .PERIOD silence 
Sound design is the future .PERIOD and i think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds 
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia .PERIOD to make music and sound in a group of people ,COMMA whichever style you enjoy particularly 
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong ,COMMA which is very good for you 
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background ,COMMA but we haven't yet 
Einstein realized that if space were empty ,COMMA if the universe were empty ,COMMA it would be like this picture ,COMMA except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it ,COMMA 
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions 
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .PERIOD 
It's actually not massive enough 
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there ,COMMA because we couldn't anymore than light can escape 
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .PERIOD 
Want to get away from the sound 
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .PERIOD 
There are very industrious experiments being built on earth -- one called ligo -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .PERIOD 
It's everywhere it's all around you ,COMMA and the space is wobbling chaotically 
Imagine a billion years ago ,COMMA two black holes collided 
If it was the big bang ,COMMA we were going to pick up it would sound like this 
And if we pick it up ,COMMA it will be music to our ears ,COMMA because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe ,COMMA 
And our prison system itself is stuck .PERIOD 
Funds for education for training ,COMMA and for rehabilitation are declining ,COMMA so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues 
We give science lectures and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures ,COMMA instead of watching television or weightlifting .PERIOD 
We partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state 
And just recently we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities .PERIOD 
And so what we see ,COMMA i think is that small collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .PERIOD 
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child 
That implies a lot of trust 
As the child grows ,COMMA it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust 
You can be compassionate .PERIOD occasionally more moved by empathy than by compassion 
The tennis etiquette is ,COMMA both the players have to come to the net and shake hands 
Compassion is not defined in one form 
That means the whole universe known things and unknown things 
There's no choice in this ,COMMA that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you cannot be minus you 
You express yourself ,COMMA because you have compassion 
There is no shortcut .PERIOD it is like swimming by swimming 
That's interesting to me 
You fake it and make it 
If you know how to pray pray 
Well ,COMMA it has its pluses and minuses 
Therefore we don't find the moral emotional ,COMMA psychological and political space ,COMMA to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .PERIOD 
Oddly enough ,COMMA an artist such as myself finds herself ,COMMA also in the position of being the voice ,COMMA the speaker of my people ,COMMA even if i have ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA no access to my own country .PERIOD 
We are there to take pride and insist on respect 
I envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression 
Our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication .PERIOD 
I work in morocco in turkey in mexico ,COMMA 
How to tell a political story ,COMMA but an allegorical story 
What was most significant for me was once again ,COMMA the presence of the women 
Start differentiating into effector and memory cells 
We have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of 100 to 200000 videos a day 
And then in a response to that ,COMMA same comment -- this is on the thread 
But the paradigm here is ,COMMA we'll generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept ,COMMA until you get 10 in a row 
In a traditional classroom ,COMMA you have a couple of homework ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA homework ,COMMA lecture ,COMMA and then you have a snapshot exam 
But as ridiculous as that sounds ,COMMA that's exactly what's happening in our classrooms ,COMMA right now 
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- is from this knowledge map ,COMMA you have logic .PERIOD you have computer programming ,COMMA you have grammar ,COMMA you have genetics .PERIOD all based off of that core of if you know this ,COMMA and that now you're ready for this next concept ,COMMA 
It'll change what happens at the dinner table 
Green means the student's already proficient 
And the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems that the student got right or wrong .PERIOD 
And so the same kids that you thought were slow .PERIOD six weeks ago you now would think are gifted 
And i think what you'll see emerging is this notion of a global one-world classroom 
I'm still doing all the videos ,COMMA but we have a rockstar team doing the software .PERIOD 
And they're doing it at the district level .PERIOD 
And they're literally saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA this is nice .PERIOD but like that focus graph ,COMMA a lot of the teachers said ,COMMA i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic 
But yeah ,COMMA it's all there 
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination ,COMMA 
So i am going to be talking about hallucinations and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients .PERIOD 
Animals too 
I see cats and dogs walking towards me ,COMMA 
She said ,COMMA it's got color .PERIOD it's got motion 
I said ,COMMA there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness 
And you have charles bonnet syndrome .PERIOD 
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .PERIOD 
Now with the original description in the 18th century ,COMMA charles bonnet did not have them 
On one occasion ,COMMA he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe ,COMMA and realized it was himself 
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen 
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie ,COMMA the faces were often deformed with very large teeth or very large eyes 
In particular ,COMMA the notion is that if you see things or hear things you're going mad .PERIOD but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different 
And in particular ,COMMA one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells ,COMMA which can be very ,COMMA very specific 
Well ,COMMA i've more or less said ,COMMA what i wanted 
But they stop there 
Well ,COMMA they don't disturb me any more than my tinnitus ,COMMA which i ignore 
They occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them in my notebooks 
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean ,COMMA make light 
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence 
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution 
This is the first time it has ever been recorded 
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate .PERIOD a single-celled alga 
There's a lot of animals that use this trick ,COMMA for example ,COMMA this black dragonfish 
It's got a light organ under its eye .PERIOD 
It's a scream for help .PERIOD it's meant to attract attention ,COMMA 
There's other ways ,COMMA you can defend yourself with light 
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this 
This is a golden coral ,COMMA a bush 
We're talking to something 
But he's persistent 
We need more eyes on the process 
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process 
In the top left-hand corner ,COMMA you've got .PERIOD this yellow-green area 
And those red molecules are hemoglobin 
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs ,COMMA and then carry it to other parts of the body 
And that's how i really began .PERIOD so let's begin 
Those are the letters of genetic code ,COMMA the 25000 genes ,COMMA you've got written in your dna 
But they physically run in opposite directions ,COMMA which creates a number of complications for your living cells as you're about to see most ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA when dna is being copied 
And so what i'm about to show ,COMMA you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that's occurring right now inside your body ,COMMA at least 2002 biology 
And it's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules ,COMMA which i've stripped away .PERIOD so you can see something 
But in each one of your cells ,COMMA each strand of dna is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long ,COMMA 
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins ,COMMA thousands of proteins in total 
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal 
This is how you work at the molecular scale 
And we don't know exactly how they did this ,COMMA although they must have solved some collective action problems .PERIOD it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups .PERIOD 
So that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms 
Again ,COMMA we can't know ,COMMA but we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved 
We saw scientific revolutions ,COMMA the protestant reformation ,COMMA constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them ,COMMA the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons 
Garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s 
And most recently ,COMMA neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games show activity in the reward centers of their brain 
Jim surowiecki .PERIOD briefly mentioned yochai benkler's paper about open source pointing to a new form of production :COLON peer-to-peer production .PERIOD 
Toyota ,COMMA instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace ,COMMA treats them as a network and trains them to produce better ,COMMA even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .PERIOD 
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are ,COMMA but i think we can begin to think about them 
I believe that the payoff would be very big 
What forms of suffering could be alleviated ,COMMA what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation 
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse is automatically going to happen .PERIOD it's going to require effort 
I'm not going to dive into them either ,COMMA but photosynths are integrated into the map .PERIOD 
So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live .PERIOD and this is really truly ,COMMA very frightening ,COMMA 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA the other way 
This is the current -- thank you -- this is the current time .PERIOD if we scrub the time ,COMMA then we can see how the sky will look at different times ,COMMA and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times ,COMMA different dates ,COMMA let's move the moon ,COMMA a little higher in the sky ,COMMA maybe change the date .PERIOD 
All right now ,COMMA i've overrun my time ,COMMA so i've got to stop 
Sophal ear so notwithstanding the 1970s narration on april 17th ,COMMA 1975 ,COMMA we lived in phnom penh 
They were young soldiers .PERIOD typically child soldiers 
So the khmer rouge took us from a place called pursat to kaoh tiev ,COMMA which is across from the border from vietnam 
And we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .PERIOD 
And then onwards to chau doc ,COMMA 
Thank you mother 
Somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you 
And one evening ,COMMA i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul ,COMMA and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan 
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted ,COMMA and we had 45 all over kabul 
We developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach .PERIOD 
And now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future 
Child there is no difference here between classes nor white or black ,COMMA nor if you have money or not 
Simply if you are talented ,COMMA if you have the vocation and the will to be here ,COMMA you get in you share with us and make music 
In its essence ,COMMA the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures 
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among them ,COMMA develop their self-esteem and foster the ethical and aesthetical values related to the music in all its senses .PERIOD 
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic 
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home ,COMMA while her mother does the housework 
And these will be some simple design qualities ,COMMA and they will also be some qualities of if you will the intelligence of interaction 
Now ,COMMA we've put people 18 inches in front of a tv ,COMMA and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen .PERIOD all of a sudden are staring you in the face .PERIOD the shadow mask ,COMMA the scan lines ,COMMA all of that 
And my favorite example is always fingers 
In fact ,COMMA they're not .PERIOD it's really a very ,COMMA very high-resolution input ,COMMA medium -- you have to just do it twice .PERIOD you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly -- and you can move a cursor with great accuracy .PERIOD 
And we have never known how to do this technically .PERIOD so this slide is a fake slide 
Ok ,COMMA so there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation 
The person's just if you will pushing on the screen to make a curve 
And what you can do -- oops ,COMMA i didn't mean to do that -- what you can do is actually feed back to the user ,COMMA the feeling of the physical properties ,COMMA 
What i'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book where it is mixed now with all sorts of things live in there ,COMMA but you have to keep a few things in mind 
So it knows ,COMMA or at least there is computer-readable information in the medium itself .PERIOD it's just not a static movie frame .PERIOD 
Now that would be if you will the top green track ,COMMA which doesn't mean too much ,COMMA but you might have to elaborate for me ,COMMA or for somebody who isn't an expert and say ,COMMA cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes .PERIOD 
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question ,COMMA the last thing you do is repeat what you just said 
He says ,COMMA well ,COMMA reading is this junk .PERIOD they give me in little books to read 
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar ,COMMA but wow ,COMMA the key to the future of computers in education is right there .PERIOD and it is ,COMMA when does it mean something to a child 
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child .PERIOD the child can get a great deal by talking to you 
Well in senegal ,COMMA we found that this was the traditional classroom .PERIOD 120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher ,COMMA a little bit of chalk .PERIOD 
That's what meant something to her is doing the hair pattern ,COMMA and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day -- and found it was to her ,COMMA absolutely the most meaningful piece ,COMMA 
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues ,COMMA whom i see in the room can imagine what it will be 
Now that is sufficiently zany that we would obviously jump to the bait ,COMMA and we did 
So if i all of a sudden ,COMMA turn to the person to my left and start talking to that person ,COMMA then at the person to my right's site ,COMMA he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other 
And then if that person interrupts ,COMMA then those two heads may turn 
We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications 
And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time ,COMMA down to the tenths of a microsecond ,COMMA that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend ,COMMA and we start talking to them immediately ,COMMA or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk where they're like ,COMMA wait who is this ?QUESTIONMARK oh right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So sensors are looking at that kind of voice 
If they have a hip fracture we go with them ,COMMA and we study their entire discharge experience 
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar ,COMMA but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of ,COMMA get out in front of it and do something about it .PERIOD we'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe ,COMMA and react ,COMMA as opposed to prepare for it .PERIOD 
This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large ,COMMA expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787 
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare ,COMMA 
How do we collect not just biological data ,COMMA but behavioral data ,COMMA psychological data ,COMMA relational data in and on and around the home 
They fixed her back up ,COMMA she was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living .PERIOD they put her into the nursing home unit .PERIOD 
I'm not bragging about how much we fund .PERIOD it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging ,COMMA chronic disease management and independent living in the home 
And so that's what i've been striving for ,COMMA all of my life 
But instead ,COMMA i go out ,COMMA and i find things 
Then i just pick things up 
And so ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA i was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues 
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals ,COMMA 
In social groups of animals ,COMMA the juveniles always look different than the adults 
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well ,COMMA 
Now it wasn't dna .PERIOD she didn't find dna 
We gave samples to mary schweitzer ,COMMA and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone 
And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer ,COMMA and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples 
I mean ,COMMA it was wonderful stuff 
So that's what i'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken .PERIOD 
We started out with a wolf-like creature ,COMMA and we ended up with a maltese 
And so ,COMMA that's what we're looking into 
Archaeopteryx ,COMMA which is a bird ,COMMA a primitive bird .PERIOD still has that very primitive hand .PERIOD 
It has the three fingers .PERIOD the three digits 
Birds have basically rudimentary tails 
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail ,COMMA gets rid of it 
And people always say ,COMMA why do that 
What the frigoris you doing names are important .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA frank is this clear to you ?QUESTIONMARK djabran fluctus .PERIOD 
Listen ,COMMA i'm going back to the swamp mermaid .PERIOD can you call me in a little while 
So these are actual names of people that work there 
I did some more investigation 
There are some mapping people who do use their names 
So formulas relate number to form 
They got little babies in there floating in there ,COMMA 
It's a different kind ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and they've got five apples 
Because that's why we're here really ,COMMA i think to figure stuff out and to love each other ,COMMA 
They are so different 
Bode's law wasn't even his law .PERIOD it was a guy named titus 
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted 
Golden section ,COMMA i've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born 
I know that scares a lot of you ,COMMA but that was my purpose entirely 
If fibonacci had been on paxil that would be the fibonacci series 
Yes ,COMMA mama 
There is so many intricate relationships that i'm not going to go there .PERIOD now because you would say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA go back to the fluctus part 
And i'm presenting it here at ted .PERIOD why 
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant .PERIOD it's hidden 
And look at this built within it is the golden ratio 
Thank you 
Good afternoon 
In 1982 in the middle of the cold war in soviet siberia ,COMMA a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons ,COMMA the equivalent of a fourth of the hiroshima bomb 
And with these keys ,COMMA they may have been able to get inside centcom's systems to see and hear everything ,COMMA and maybe even infect some of them 
As a result ,COMMA the americans take the threat very seriously .PERIOD 
I'll quote general ,COMMA james cartwright ,COMMA vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who says ,COMMA in a report to congress ,COMMA that cyberattacks could be as powerful as weapons of mass destruction .PERIOD 
Moreover ,COMMA the americans have decided to spend over 30 billion dollars in the next five years to build up their cyberwar capabilities 
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature .PERIOD they can be used without leaving traces 
Cartoons are basically short stories 
And that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land ,COMMA but when you get to the waters edge ,COMMA the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint 
And best of all ,COMMA i saw the animals 
Could you image if we looked through the hubble telescope and we saw that 
It would start a whole new space race ,COMMA 
For instance .PERIOD take these sea turtles 
They kind of have a sixth sense like ,COMMA superman's x-ray vision ,COMMA 
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth 
Or take this sea cucumber 
He's sort of a homer simpson ,COMMA with fins ,COMMA 
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish .PERIOD 
The third storyline i did about a year .PERIOD and a half ago was probably my most difficult 
I do three or four strips after that ,COMMA where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue 
There was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins ,COMMA so i kind of exposed that 
And you see ,COMMA you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster 
So you say to yourself ,COMMA well that's worth something 
So you go back into the room ,COMMA and you break this thing to pieces ,COMMA and you haul it away 
Thanks for listening 
Audience 22 
Audience 47 
Woman ,COMMA no 
594 ,COMMA let's give three of them a nice round of applause .PERIOD there 
What i'm going to try and do then -- i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer 
Audience 23 
Audience 59 
95218564 
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that 
In the meanwhile ,COMMA let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .PERIOD 
Really scramble them up this time ,COMMA please 
For my next number -- while i mentally recharge my batteries ,COMMA i have one more question for the audience 
Let's see starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first ,COMMA ok ,COMMA sir .PERIOD what year was it ?QUESTIONMARK first of all .PERIOD that's why i start with a gentleman first 
Yell it out what year audience :COLON 1959 
1959 ,COMMA ok -- and the month 
Audience may ab :COLON may what 
It was ab .PERIOD and it was cloudy 
57683 squared ,COMMA yuck .PERIOD 
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts 
I'll do 57000 squared ,COMMA plus 683 squared ,COMMA plus 57000 times .PERIOD 683 times two 
While i explain something else -- -- i know that you can use right 
That seems right ?QUESTIONMARK i'll go on cookie fission ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
A third time ,COMMA it's just being a technician 
So i'm not going to talk about that 
Get them out of schools and keep them out of schools 
Having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago ,COMMA 
No ,COMMA if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years ,COMMA ask a kindergarten teacher 
But to me ,COMMA things aren't the future 
Right away ,COMMA i hope that all of your eyes glaze over ,COMMA 
This is a klein bottle .PERIOD 
It's one sided ,COMMA it's a bottle whose inside is its outside .PERIOD 
It has zero volume ,COMMA and it's non-orientable 
It has wonderful properties .PERIOD 
That was a month of my life 
Oh ,COMMA cool ,COMMA i can get to this place over here ,COMMA right 
I take lunch hour 
One of the things that i've done for my science students is to tell them .PERIOD look ,COMMA i'm going to teach you college-level physics .PERIOD 
Is a constant ,COMMA when the frequency goes up .PERIOD the wavelength comes down .PERIOD wavelength goes up ,COMMA frequency ,COMMA goes down .PERIOD so if we have a wave here -- over here ,COMMA that's what's interesting -- as the pitch goes up ,COMMA things get closer ,COMMA pitch goes down .PERIOD things stretch out ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA so i know the frequency 
Those of you who are physicists ,COMMA i hear you rolling your eyes ,COMMA but bear with me 
It's one of these bell-tower buildings 
I keep climbing up ,COMMA go back 
A dome ,COMMA one of these ten-foot domes 
In this light may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind from darkness to light .PERIOD from narrowness to broad-mindedness ,COMMA from prejudice to tolerance 
It's time for me to let it go 
We want space efficiency 
Finally ,COMMA we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet ,COMMA a dining table becomes a bed -- same space ,COMMA a little side table stretches out to seat 10 
Guests move the moving wall .PERIOD have some fold-down guest beds 
Thank you 
Seriously but dangerously fun ,COMMA 
And there it is ,COMMA and i think this is a typical picture of what it was like in a courtyard ,COMMA then 
So i'm gonna take you through what i think is a remarkable sequence 
Any of you who've been to africa or had a junkyard dog come after you ,COMMA there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze that you know you're in trouble 
And this polar bear stands over the husky ,COMMA no claws extended ,COMMA no fangs taking a look 
And it's that state that allows these two creatures to explore the possible .PERIOD 
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done without the play signals .PERIOD 
And it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us .PERIOD 
John mentioned that i've done some work with murderers ,COMMA and i have 
If you're having a bad day ,COMMA try this jump up and down ,COMMA wiggle around -- you're going to feel better 
But it has to be safe exploration .PERIOD 
But if you look closely ,COMMA they're kind of like the polar bear and husky ,COMMA no claws ,COMMA flat fur ,COMMA soft eyes ,COMMA open mouth with no fangs ,COMMA balletic movements ,COMMA curvilinear movements -- all specific to play 
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story .PERIOD 
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain ,COMMA because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play .PERIOD 
I think that -- that's a few years back -- i think that wave is past ,COMMA and the play wave is cresting ,COMMA because there is some good science 
Now the program says that the opposite of play is not work .PERIOD it's depression 
Nobody misses that dog .PERIOD i took a picture of on a carmel beach a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA 
You may not know this word ,COMMA but it should be your biological first name and last name 
Found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined ,COMMA he felt something different 
And looking at his history ,COMMA which is common in the press ,COMMA it seems to me at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view -- that a lot of his life was programmed 
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and washington ,COMMA dc 
Most of us work with groups ,COMMA and i put this up because the dschool the design school at stanford .PERIOD thanks to david kelley and a lot of others who have been visionary about its establishment has allowed a group of us to get together and create a course called from play to innovation .PERIOD 
So what will follow is a student-made film about just that 
But it doesn't have to be that way 
Thank you 
If you stop a cat from playing -- which you can do ,COMMA and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff -- they're just as good predators as they would be .PERIOD if they hadn't played 
And if you look at sleep and dreams ,COMMA biologically animals sleep and dream ,COMMA and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory .PERIOD and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams 
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i think the only way i know to do it is to have accumulated the advisers that i have who go from practitioners -- who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever -- a state of play 
Unfortunately ,COMMA that hasn't been done sufficiently for the national science foundation ,COMMA national institute of mental health ,COMMA or anybody else to really look at it in this way .PERIOD seriously ,COMMA 
So our diners started to get bored with this idea ,COMMA and we decided to give them the same course twice .PERIOD so here we actually took an element from the maki roll ,COMMA and and took a picture of a dish ,COMMA and then basically served that picture with the dish 
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin ,COMMA a naturally occurring thing it still freaks me out every time i eat it ,COMMA but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue .PERIOD so that primarily sour taste receptors .PERIOD so normally things that would taste very sour or tart ,COMMA somehow begin to taste very sweet .PERIOD 
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment .PERIOD it doesn't matter 
Aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi ,COMMA new delhi and mumbai ,COMMA there are no network news bureaus in all of africa ,COMMA india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people .PERIOD 
And can we afford not to thank you 
At this time ,COMMA there were thousands of individuals .PERIOD we think that were infected with hiv 
Ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA had we been there in the '40s and '50s ,COMMA '60s ,COMMA had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it .PERIOD how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved 
Nevertheless ,COMMA we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid ,COMMA trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very ,COMMA very difficult to address -- as we've seen in the case of hiv .PERIOD 
So during the last 15 years ,COMMA i've been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i've labeled viral chatter ,COMMA which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .PERIOD 
Narrator ,COMMA deep in a remote region of cameroon ,COMMA two hunters stalk their prey 
A group of hunters approach ,COMMA their packs loaded with wild game 
This is challenging work to do 
But -- when he began to speak ,COMMA they would actually recognize his voice from the radio 
So what happened ?QUESTIONMARK so during the 10 years that we've been doing this work ,COMMA we actually surprised ourselves 
We made a number of discoveries 
It's something we should be following .PERIOD it's not something that we should be surprised by 
So it's not just hunters in central africa .PERIOD 
And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iphone ,COMMA which my friends ,COMMA and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for 
If you look carefully ,COMMA you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left ,COMMA where the virtual world has literally punched through to the physical 
Because this is ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency 
By saying ,COMMA who is that person in the mirror ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA it's actually me 
Song is one of our oldest ways of making ourselves heard and understood 
And so ,COMMA whereas dr .PERIOD oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia ,COMMA where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this ,COMMA phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent 
So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light 
You know ,COMMA they don't imagine the person in the booth typing it all 
And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges that's very currently active in the computer sciences ,COMMA being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away .PERIOD how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal ,COMMA what you're interested in ,COMMA and where your attention is directed 
And so i've been beginning with a variety of different projects ,COMMA to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes 
In the first one ,COMMA which i'm going to show you called eyecode .PERIOD it's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle ,COMMA the trace left by the looking of the previous observer ,COMMA looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer .PERIOD 
But if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop ,COMMA then you'll see these nice crisp eyes 
And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes as you're looking at other peoples' eyes 
And this exists in larger installations ,COMMA where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be staring at as you see ,COMMA who's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them 
Checking him out 
You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less and people who are interested in you get those updates 
It is by sharing these moments as they're happening that lets people feel more connected .PERIOD and in touch ,COMMA despite distance ,COMMA and in real time ,COMMA 
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago .PERIOD when there was a gas shortage in atlanta ,COMMA 
It's happened more and more lately ,COMMA whether it's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa ,COMMA or for a family in crisis ,COMMA 
Evan williams ,COMMA nice .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD 
And i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call the danger of the single story .PERIOD 
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the british books ,COMMA i read drank ginger beer 
I realized that people like me ,COMMA girls with skin ,COMMA the color of chocolate ,COMMA whose kinky hair could not form ponytails ,COMMA could also exist in literature 
But the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature 
So what the discovery of african writers did for me was this it saved me from having a single story of what books are 
So i felt enormous pity for fide's family 
If i had not grown up in nigeria .PERIOD and if all i knew about africa were from popular images ,COMMA i too would think that africa was a place of beautiful landscapes ,COMMA beautiful animals and incomprehensible people ,COMMA fighting senseless wars ,COMMA dying of poverty and aids ,COMMA unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind ,COMMA white foreigner .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i've laughed every time i've read this 
So that is how to create a single story show a people as one thing as only one thing over and over again .PERIOD and that is what they become 
My cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare 
What the nigerian writer ,COMMA chinua achebe calls a balance of stories 
What if my roommate knew about ,COMMA my nigerian publisher ,COMMA mukta bakaray ,COMMA a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house 
He disagreed .PERIOD he felt that people who could read would read ,COMMA if you made literature affordable and available to them 
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports .PERIOD 
Stories matter 
We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives .PERIOD and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions .PERIOD 
We've surrendered our power trading off our discomfort with uncertainty ,COMMA for the illusion of certainty ,COMMA that they provide 
It literally flat-lined 
But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps ,COMMA that within these camps ,COMMA a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition .PERIOD that experts move with the prevailing winds ,COMMA often hero-worshipping their own gurus .PERIOD 
A recent study in the archives of surgery ,COMMA reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries ,COMMA operating on the wrong side of the brain ,COMMA carrying out procedures on the wrong hand ,COMMA elbow ,COMMA eye ,COMMA foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors 
Why was it that when i had an operation ?QUESTIONMARK my doctor said to me ,COMMA beware .PERIOD ms .PERIOD hertz ,COMMA of hyperpyrexia ,COMMA when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever ,COMMA 
You see being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs ,COMMA their equations ,COMMA their forecasts ,COMMA their prophecies ,COMMA and being armed with the questions to do that -- questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this 
If we are to shift paradigms ,COMMA if we are to make breakthroughs ,COMMA if we are to destroy myths ,COMMA we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out in which we're bringing in new ,COMMA diverse ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views into the discussion ,COMMA fearlessly ,COMMA in the knowledge that progress comes about ,COMMA not only from the creation of ideas ,COMMA but also from their destruction -- and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent ,COMMA discordant ,COMMA heretical views 
Google ceo ,COMMA eric schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy 
But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo's ,COMMA but also shop-girls -- yeah ,COMMA 
Thank you 
And so the thought that i started with was ,COMMA how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today -- no time for science fair ,COMMA no time for playing around with things ,COMMA or waiting for the magic battery to show up 
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop -- ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive for about two hours and park for about 22 hours 
Now that last mile last foot ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA is the first step of the infrastructure 
What we found out when you move from molecules to electrons .PERIOD something interesting happens 
We have a battery bay .PERIOD it costs the same hundred dollars as the gas tank .PERIOD 
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we're in in the us 
That's a new economic factor ,COMMA which is fascinating to most people 
So we went out ,COMMA and we looked at all the car companies 
And i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place 
We decided to come into the us 
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .PERIOD 
By 2015 ,COMMA we would have had at least 250 million new cars ,COMMA even at the pace we're going at right now 
And then we do the opec stimulus package also known as 200 dollars a barrel ,COMMA 
And that's the difference between problems that are additive ,COMMA like co2 ,COMMA which we go slowly up ,COMMA and then we tip and problems that are depletive ,COMMA in which we lose what we have ,COMMA which oscillate ,COMMA and they oscillate until we lose everything .PERIOD we've got 
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars 
You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills ,COMMA 
That's one percent a year 
And when we go to cop15 at the end of this year ,COMMA we can't stop thinking of padding co2 
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .PERIOD 
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him 
We have to make it immediately 
And we need to do it ,COMMA not within 20 years or 50 years ,COMMA but within this presidential term ,COMMA because if we don't ,COMMA we will lose our economy ,COMMA right .PERIOD after we'd lost our morality .PERIOD 
They see us as rocking the boat ,COMMA and you can understand why 
Now it may sound as though i'm about to preach atheism ,COMMA and i want to reassure you that that's not what i'm going to do 
Essentially it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual ,COMMA step-by-step increment 
It turns out to be ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA incapable of doing the job required of it .PERIOD 
So we're used to not challenging religious ideas ,COMMA and it's very interesting how much of a furor richard creates when he does it .PERIOD he meant me ,COMMA not that one 
It teaches them to accept authority ,COMMA revelation and faith .PERIOD instead of always insisting on evidence .PERIOD 
But suppose -- -- in 1987 ,COMMA a reporter asked george bush ,COMMA sr ,COMMA 
Whether he recognized the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists ,COMMA 
She clearly feels in a beleaguered minority ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA how do american atheists stack up numerically 
The survey that i quoted ,COMMA which is the aris survey didn't break down its data by socio-economic class or education iq or anything else .PERIOD 
But let me know show you some data that have been properly published and analyzed on one special group .PERIOD namely ,COMMA top scientists 
In 1998 larson and witham polled the cream of american scientists ,COMMA those who'd been honored by election to the national academy of sciences and among this select group ,COMMA belief in a personal god dropped to a shattering seven percent 
Similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality ,COMMA 
I've not seen corresponding figures for elite scholars in other fields ,COMMA such history or philosophy .PERIOD but i'd be surprised if they were different 
And i've already hinted what that something is 
From what i've seen of ted ,COMMA i think this may be the ideal place to launch it 
Again ,COMMA i fear it will cost money 
I suspect that the word atheist itself contains or remains a stumbling block far out of proportion to what it actually means and a stumbling block to people who otherwise might be happy to out themselves .PERIOD 
Hence ,COMMA the phrase tooth fairy agnostic ,COMMA 
The onus is not on the rest of us to say ,COMMA why not 
But we don't bother to say ,COMMA so ,COMMA and this is why my friend uses tooth fairy agnostic as a label for what most people would call atheist 
When atheists ,COMMA like stephen hawking and albert einstein ,COMMA use the word god ,COMMA they use it ,COMMA of course ,COMMA as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep mysterious ,COMMA part of physics ,COMMA which we don't yet understand 
What i want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa 
Already this morning there were some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time the africa of hiv/aids ,COMMA the africa of malaria ,COMMA the africa of poverty ,COMMA the africa of conflict and the africa of disasters 
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good ,COMMA and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite 
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back ,COMMA it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together 
One in four ,COMMA sub-saharan africans is nigerian ,COMMA and it has 140 million dynamic ,COMMA people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people ,COMMA you'll never be bored .PERIOD 
Not the international monetary fund not the world bank ,COMMA where i worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president 
You couldn't get it ,COMMA you had to bribe 
The smartest one first to come in was the mtn company of south africa 
Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others have come in 
And we had gdp grow from an average of 23 percent ,COMMA the previous decade to about 65 percent .PERIOD now 
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital -- share capital 
In tourism in many african countries ,COMMA a great opportunity 
But you should know that this continent is not -- is a continent of many countries .PERIOD not one country 
But imagine the impact on a family ,COMMA if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .PERIOD 
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet ,COMMA isn't that a wonderful opportunity isn't that the way to go 
Mixing african materials such as we have with materials from elsewhere ,COMMA 
And so to start helping that i want to take us back to 1835 
Four and a half million users around the world contributing their leftover computer cycles ,COMMA whenever their computer isn't working by running a screen saver ,COMMA and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that nasa harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes 
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized ,COMMA not that it's become less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required -- but that the ownership of this capital ,COMMA the way the capitalization happens ,COMMA is radically distributed .PERIOD each of us in these advanced economies ,COMMA has one of these or something rather ,COMMA like it -- a computer 
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license they transmitted in an area ,COMMA and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property 
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action in society that was not about society itself .PERIOD 
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact 
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time 
It's creating ,COMMA and it's most visible ,COMMA when we see it as a new form of competition ,COMMA 
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry .PERIOD free and open source software ,COMMA taking market share from microsoft skype ,COMMA potentially threatening traditional telecoms ,COMMA wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias .PERIOD 
And you see surfers people who see this happening ,COMMA and in some sense ,COMMA build it into a supply chain ,COMMA which is a very curious one right .PERIOD 
In 1918 ,COMMA a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people 
It spread like wildfire ,COMMA and some died within hours of developing symptoms 
When they work ,COMMA they can make history .PERIOD but after a while you can barely hear them 
Or polio ,COMMA how many of you remember the iron lung 
So let's explore how vaccines work 
When you're pre-immunized ,COMMA what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .PERIOD 
Seth berkley really cool .PERIOD video ?QUESTIONMARK isn't it 
In addition wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza 
Now ,COMMA luckily ,COMMA that particular virus ,COMMA although very scary at the time ,COMMA did not transmit from person to person very easily 
We've got these new antibodies we've identified ,COMMA and we know that they latch onto many ,COMMA many variations of the virus 
But you know the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases 
So far animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease ,COMMA although you might get a mild case 
It was a slow ,COMMA cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs ,COMMA millions of living chicken eggs 
Now think of where this leads us 
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .PERIOD 
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die .PERIOD 
You also can use adjuvants ,COMMA which are chemicals you mix ,COMMA 
I call them the cheetah generation .PERIOD 
The cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .PERIOD 
Now we're talking about a continent that is not poor .PERIOD 
There are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl ,COMMA which leaks 
Let's take food imports 
Just add that up ,COMMA all these leakages .PERIOD 
Kwame ,COMMA nkrumah ,COMMA nyerere ,COMMA kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin ,COMMA 
By creating wealth 
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work 
Without the council ,COMMA the chief can't pass any law .PERIOD and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed 
So it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace .PERIOD 
What africans practiced was a different form of capitalism .PERIOD but then ,COMMA after independence ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism became a western institution .PERIOD and the leaders said ,COMMA africans were ready for socialism 
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed 
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can 
And the journalist was asking him ,COMMA why is this so important 
They disappeared 
But a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt .PERIOD and to send me screen shots of what they got 
And the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did 
Now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane 
We went in and sat down at the booth ,COMMA and the waitress came over ,COMMA made a big commotion over tipper 
She said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA that's former vice president al gore ?QUESTIONMARK and his wife tipper 
It's like beachcombing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells 
It's an easy visible target of concern ,COMMA and it should be .PERIOD but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks 
Insulation better design ,COMMA buy green electricity ,COMMA where you can 
A lot of us in here ,COMMA have made that decision ,COMMA and it is really pretty easy .PERIOD 
It doesn't mean that if you are a republican that i'm trying to convince you to be a democrat ,COMMA we need republicans as well .PERIOD this used to be a bipartisan issue .PERIOD and i know that in this group ,COMMA it really is become politically active .PERIOD 
We have to buy a lot of those ads ,COMMA 
Again the republicans here ,COMMA this shouldn't be partisan 
And all the burning of oil and coal and gas ,COMMA all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly 
And one of the really most incredible things ,COMMA i think is that there's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is ,COMMA densest 
You see people who are really shell-shocked 
So this is the gulf of mexico ,COMMA sparkling place ,COMMA full of fish ,COMMA 
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface ,COMMA and then it is attacked ,COMMA because they don't want the evidence .PERIOD in my opinion .PERIOD 
We heard that bacteria eat oil ,COMMA 
So do sea turtles 
When it breaks up ,COMMA it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria 
I heard the most incredible story today ,COMMA when i was on the train coming here ,COMMA 
That's the story of thousands of people 
The other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the year .PERIOD 
If it's not ,COMMA it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae .PERIOD i would certainly think 
So while the oil spill ,COMMA the leak ,COMMA the eruption ,COMMA is a catastrophe ,COMMA i think it's important to keep in mind that we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean for a very ,COMMA very long time .PERIOD 
We're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems to begin with 
It's just ridiculous 
I think that this is the result of gross negligence 
The first offshore drills were called harpoons .PERIOD 
Your sequence and mine are slightly different 
I've got brown eyes ,COMMA you might have blue or gray 
I think we should say it all together 
And still you may not see the branches 
But seriously what's wrong with this 
You already know ,COMMA enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement 
And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you 
I assure you ,COMMA this is very tiny .PERIOD it's just six microns on a side .PERIOD 
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain 
I feel curiosity and i feel wonder ,COMMA but at times i have also felt despair 
Why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome ,COMMA in its complexity that it might well be infinite 
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts ,COMMA feelings and perceptions .PERIOD our mental experiences .PERIOD 
And if you put those two facts together ,COMMA it means that your experiences can change your connectome .PERIOD 
And it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering 
And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness ,COMMA 
I'll give you a hint ?QUESTIONMARK it's a big number 
Zach kaplan .PERIOD keith and i lead a research team 
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours ,COMMA he sold it to you as if it was for sale .PERIOD right now ,COMMA 
Inventables water adventures ,COMMA dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast ,COMMA so tall ,COMMA that when you hit the bottom ,COMMA it uses brakes to stop 
In addition ,COMMA you can see from the diagram on the right ,COMMA the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet 
So i'm sure all you engineers know ,COMMA that even though aluminum is a metal ,COMMA it's not a magnetic material .PERIOD but something unexpected happens .PERIOD when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube 
It's perfectly clear ,COMMA it's odorless ,COMMA it's colorless 
Shape-retaining is common in metal ,COMMA you bend a piece of aluminum foil ,COMMA and it holds its place .PERIOD contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides ,COMMA and it always bounces back 
So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book 
For our last technology ,COMMA we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .PERIOD 
And these dyes change color in response to odors 
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses ,COMMA or even lung cancer ,COMMA the dots will change ,COMMA and they can use software to analyze the results 
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world prior to seeing this ,COMMA we would have assumed a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket .PERIOD something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense .PERIOD the way paper is being bent every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more 
Thank you 
I mean ,COMMA it's crucified 
Spanish :COLON chef accused of cheating ,COMMA 
A huge scandal for a few weeks 
That is until i went to eduardo's farm in extremadura ,COMMA 50 miles north of seville ,COMMA right on the portugal border 
I'm just here to give the geese what they want 
I was speaking too loudly ,COMMA 
Right up to us like right up to here ,COMMA 
He doesn't 
So he got rid of the electricity .PERIOD he got rid of current on the inside and kept it on the outside ,COMMA so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators ,COMMA 
Part of the income for his farm 
A big part of his income for his farm 
That's how i've been trained 
So i'm listening to all this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i'm like is this guy for real is he making some of this up 
Is he like ,COMMA you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything ,COMMA and it was always nature .PERIOD 
Because really they want you to look at themselves ,COMMA right 
And we're sitting there ,COMMA and i hear [clapping] from a distance ,COMMA so i look over 
To fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm 
And the problem with saying that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that you know ,COMMA at this point it risks hyperbole really easily 
I'm really in love with him at this point 
He takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras ,COMMA he sticks them in this jar and he confits it 
No salt ,COMMA no pepper ,COMMA no oil ,COMMA no spices ,COMMA 
We went back out for the final tour of the farm ,COMMA and he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure existed on his farm for salinity 
How come you don't give him this 
I really was moved 
The pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it 
And the jews ,COMMA fearing for their life ,COMMA had to come up with an ingenious idea ,COMMA or at least try and satisfy the pharaoh's wishes ,COMMA of course ,COMMA 
One in which we stop treating the planet ,COMMA as if it were some kind of business in liquidation 
Whether we're talking about brussels sprouts or foie gras 
That is our poetry that is our beautiful story .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA i can see if i found something up up ,COMMA and they continue up up up 
You you survive ,COMMA it's ok .PERIOD 
Nobody's obliged to be a genius ,COMMA 
It's better ,COMMA but nobody 
This line of evolution is clearly positive 
But if you take a lens like that ,COMMA this line is ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack ,COMMA ack like that .PERIOD 
There is different type of barbaria .PERIOD 
That's why today i'm so ashamed to make this job 
But i know that even i do it ,COMMA the best possible -- that's why i'm the best -- it's nothing 
And because we must all work to finish this story 
This scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented .PERIOD this concept of god ,COMMA 
You go to the future back back back back like that 
He would also supply me with tools 
It was this great magic store .PERIOD it was a crappy little building in midtown .PERIOD but you'd be in the elevator ,COMMA the elevator would open -- there'd be this little small magic store .PERIOD you'd be in the magic store 
And so i started thinking about lost ,COMMA and the stuff that we do ,COMMA and i realized ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god mystery boxes are everywhere in what i do 
Jack get him out of here ,COMMA get him away from the engine .PERIOD get him out of here .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA hey ,COMMA get away from -- jja :COLON now 10 years ago ,COMMA if we wanted to do that ,COMMA we'd have to kill ,COMMA a stuntman 
And i often am like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA dude .PERIOD today i'm out .PERIOD i got nothing .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
So there's that in terms of the content of it ,COMMA you look at stories .PERIOD you think .PERIOD well ,COMMA what are stories ?QUESTIONMARK but mystery ?QUESTIONMARK boxes 
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination -- the withholding of information ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doing that intentionally is much more engaging 
Die hard ,COMMA right crazy ,COMMA great fun ,COMMA action-adventure movie in a building 
There are great scenes -- maybe not the most amazing dramatic scenes in the history of time ,COMMA but pretty great scenes 
Father 'cause i need it 
Come on ,COMMA so you think of jaws -- so that's the kind of stuff that like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the investment of character ,COMMA which is the stuff that really is inside the box .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
It's why when people do sequels ,COMMA or rip off movies ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of a genre ,COMMA they're ripping off .PERIOD the wrong thing .PERIOD 
You gotta rip off -- you know ,COMMA if you rip something off -- rip off the character ,COMMA 
Because ultimately ,COMMA you know the mystery box is all of us .PERIOD so there's that 
The moment the lights go down is often the best part .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
And you're full of that amazing -- that feeling of excited .PERIOD anticipation :COLON 
The stuff that i was lucky and begging for to get when i was a kid is now ubiquitous 
When i did mission impossible iii ,COMMA we had amazing visual effects stuff .PERIOD 
So eddie has this gun -- and he's the greatest guy -- he's this really sweet .PERIOD english guy .PERIOD he's like ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD i don't want to hurt you .PERIOD 
And i realized that we had to do something 'cause it wasn't working ,COMMA just as it was 
And tom would know just how hard to push the gun .PERIOD he wouldn't hurt himself 
And in the egyptian revolution ,COMMA the revolution 20 ,COMMA everyone has contributed something small or big ,COMMA they contributed something -- to bring us one of the most inspiring stories in the history of mankind .PERIOD when it comes to revolutions ,COMMA 
It was actually really inspiring to see all these egyptians completely changing 
But the reason why everyone was silent is what i call the psychological barrier of fear 
And that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years ,COMMA and here comes the internet ,COMMA technology ,COMMA blackberry ,COMMA sms 
Platforms like youtube ,COMMA twitter facebook were helping us a lot ,COMMA because it basically gave us the impression that wow ,COMMA i'm not alone .PERIOD 
They probably have the best life in the world 
And everyone started to think that this guy could be my brother 
What are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know 
In a few days ,COMMA tens of thousands of people there -- angry egyptians who were asking the ministry of interior affairs enough 
But of course they don't listen 
In fact ,COMMA one of the most ridiculous ideas was ,COMMA hey ,COMMA let's have a silent .PERIOD stand 
There was no leader 
And i'm not going to talk about my experience ,COMMA because this is not about me 
The next day i was in tahrir 
When i saw that i went back ,COMMA and i wrote on facebook ,COMMA 
But today ,COMMA i'm going to talk to you about something you can't see -- what's going on up in that little brain of hers .PERIOD 
And therein lies a critical puzzle .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's got to do with your brain 
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics 
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .PERIOD 
So this is little emma 
Just as the poets and writers described we're going to be able to see ,COMMA i think that wondrous openness ,COMMA utter and complete openness of the mind of a child 
Thank you 
And early in the morning ,COMMA i went into the ward 
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man .PERIOD 
And we run clinics in these very remote regions where there's no medical care whatsoever .PERIOD 
And he walked in ,COMMA and somebody said something to him ,COMMA we realized he was deaf ,COMMA and we looked into the rags ,COMMA and there was this pair of eyes 
The rags were unwrapped from a little girl whose body was massively burned 
It was the young women ,COMMA the health aids ,COMMA who cleaned the wounds of this baby and dressed the wounds ,COMMA 
And my family brought in a woman ,COMMA whose mother had been a slave to take care of me 
And that woman did not have sentimental compassion .PERIOD 
I had that condition to a certain extent from my own childhood ,COMMA illness 
And in that paralysis ,COMMA of course ,COMMA our capacity for compassion is also paralyzed .PERIOD 
The very word terror is global .PERIOD 
So our work ,COMMA in a certain way ,COMMA is to address this imago ,COMMA this kind of archetype that has pervaded the psyche of our entire globe 
Hey ,COMMA we live in a very noxious world 
Why don't we train our children in compassion 
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered ,COMMA unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is 
And they have actualized compassion through direct action .PERIOD 
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .PERIOD 
I was one of the founding members of the axis of evil comedy tour 
Then there was aron kader who was the palestinian-american

But it was his production of a butterfly .PERIOD that was the most beautiful 
Marco tempest when asked about deception ,COMMA he said this .PERIOD announcer :COLON magic is the only honest profession 
I use a lot of tricks ,COMMA which means that sometimes i have to lie to you 
Girl in phone ,COMMA hey ,COMMA where are you 
Lady ,COMMA i'll be ready in just a minute .PERIOD darling .PERIOD 
Self-deception 
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos we are so wonderfully optimistic .PERIOD 
Put a crab inside it 
So the guy replies ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i know ,COMMA i know 
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing ,COMMA awkward silences ,COMMA and very simple rhyme schemes 
[ i don't need 2 write it down .PERIOD ] i'm going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .PERIOD 
Now as many of you may remember the red brigades was a terrorist marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s .PERIOD 
As part of their strategy ,COMMA the red brigades never spoke with anybody ,COMMA not even with their lawyers 
In 1993 ,COMMA they declared the end of the armed struggle .PERIOD 
But this is exactly what i did ,COMMA because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist ,COMMA and why she'd never tried to recruit me 
So because i am a trained economist ,COMMA and i think ,COMMA in economic terms ,COMMA all of the sudden i thought ,COMMA maybe there is something here 
And there are three main stages .PERIOD 
But above all ,COMMA they started to do serious business with the world of crime .PERIOD 
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history .PERIOD 
And it actually happened again with the fall of the berlin wall 
What does it mean that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have 
This privilege is called seigniorage 
No other country can do that 
What the patriot act did was to prohibit us bank ,COMMA and us-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities .PERIOD 
It also gave the us monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
It was introduced only in the united states 
In europe ,COMMA a similar legislation was not introduced .PERIOD 
Cumulatively i will have rowed over 8000 miles ,COMMA taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than 312 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA some of you might be thinking hold on a minute .PERIOD she doesn't look very much like an ocean rower .PERIOD 
I thought there were them ,COMMA and there were us ,COMMA and i was not one of them 
And i think i knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me 
I'd gone through some changes 
And i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking ,COMMA oh boy ,COMMA i'm on totally the wrong track here 
It was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one 
Mostly a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown ,COMMA depending on whether i went backwards overnight -- and lots of sun lotion ,COMMA 
So because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii ,COMMA without dropping in i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments .PERIOD 
But what do you do 
I had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy for his country ,COMMA 
I even met one of them ,COMMA and she was just about my size 
This is a world-wide community .PERIOD 
I plan on being around for a long time .PERIOD and when i'm 90 years old ,COMMA i want to be happy and healthy 
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet where we've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air 
And the idea here is that all our eco-heroes will log at least one green deed every day 
And if you put creation and optimism together ,COMMA you've got two choices that you can talk about 
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time .PERIOD 
This was a scheme by a team ,COMMA called think a new york-based team .PERIOD and then there was that one ,COMMA which was the libeskind scheme ,COMMA 
We all want to go out and buy an audi .PERIOD tt don't :COLON we 
It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger ,COMMA sort of more romantic image of where we are 
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today ,COMMA 
Yeah ,COMMA it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it's sort of a little movie without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page .PERIOD and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it ,COMMA 
They all want to save money by building the same thing .PERIOD 500 times 
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that's what will happen in the end 
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana 
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune ,COMMA 
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before 
It has its own built-in swimming pool ,COMMA very ,COMMA very cool .PERIOD 
Here it is going across ,COMMA and there down the other side ,COMMA and you get the same kind of grandeur .PERIOD 
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white 
Rosa mexicano restaurant ,COMMA where he transports us to the shores of acapulco ,COMMA up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go like that 
Boo hewerdine ,COMMA thomas dolby .PERIOD thank you very much for inviting me .PERIOD it's been a blessing singing for you 
Right now is the most exciting time to see new indian art .PERIOD 
This next artist ns .PERIOD harsha actually has a studio right here in mysore .PERIOD 
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition .PERIOD 
He creates these fine ,COMMA delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale .PERIOD 
This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary indian .PERIOD art subodh :COLON gupta 
But i can only hope i've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in india today ,COMMA 
So i'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations .PERIOD first of all ,COMMA i want to show you the particular illusion here i want you first of all ,COMMA when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other .PERIOD these are all perceptual tricks .PERIOD these are real objects that i'm going to show you .PERIOD now i'm going to show you how it is done .PERIOD i've looped the film here .PERIOD so you can get a very interesting experience .PERIOD i want you to see how this illusion is constructed ,COMMA and it's going to rotate .PERIOD so you see that it's inside out .PERIOD now ,COMMA watch ,COMMA as it rotates back ,COMMA how quickly your perception snaps .PERIOD ok .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
How many of you here see ?QUESTIONMARK dolphins ,COMMA raise your hand .PERIOD if you see dolphins ,COMMA ok ,COMMA those people who raised their hands afterwards ,COMMA the rest of the audience go talk to them all right .PERIOD actually .PERIOD this is the best example of priming by experience that i know 
Now something like this can be used ,COMMA because this is after all talk about design too .PERIOD this was done by saatchi and saatchi .PERIOD and they actually got away with this ad in australia .PERIOD so if you look at this ad for beer ,COMMA all those people are in sort of provocative positions ,COMMA but they got it passed and actually won the clio awards .PERIOD so it's funny how you can do these things 
You can violate your expectations about experience here is an outside water fountain that i created with some friends of mine .PERIOD but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually ,COMMA make all the drops levitate .PERIOD this is something we're building for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA amusement parks ,COMMA and that kind of stuff 
Well ,COMMA there's analog and digital thought that was appropriate here .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to skip ahead since i'm sort of running [behind] .PERIOD i want to show you quickly what i've created ,COMMA some new type of illusions .PERIOD i've done something with taking the pixar-type illusions .PERIOD so you see these kids the same size here ,COMMA running down the hall ,COMMA the two table tops of the same size 
And it's interesting by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion ,COMMA how much stronger the illusions are any case .PERIOD i hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness .PERIOD and if you're interested in seeing more cool effects ,COMMA see me outside ,COMMA i'd be happy to show you lots of things 
So i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity .PERIOD we're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems .PERIOD 
I'm here today ,COMMA as june said ,COMMA to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past ,COMMA three and half years .PERIOD 
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef 
So we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures 
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals .PERIOD and kelps ,COMMA and sponges and nudibranchs ,COMMA is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry 
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet .PERIOD it happens to be a fact 
Before hyperbolic geometry ,COMMA mathematicians knew about two kinds of space ,COMMA euclidean space and spherical space .PERIOD 
And they have different properties .PERIOD 
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball ,COMMA the surface of the earth 
And on the surface of a sphere ,COMMA a straight line is the biggest possible circle .PERIOD you can draw 
To a mathematician ,COMMA if there are two answers ,COMMA and the first two are zero and one there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative 
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you ,COMMA they're sitting there feeling bamboozled .PERIOD 
I've stitched euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface 
Here's two creatures who've never heard of euclid's ,COMMA parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate ,COMMA and they're simply getting on with it .PERIOD 
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age 
And that's true ,COMMA but it also goes deeper than that ,COMMA 
And so too ,COMMA we've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .PERIOD 
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code ,COMMA the models immediately started to look more natural 
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education ,COMMA established by a man named friedrich froebel ,COMMA who was a crystallographer .PERIOD in the 19th century 
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA so how do you study this mysterious organ 
So let me give you a few striking examples of this 
And if you look ,COMMA tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes -- you can't see it there -- is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .PERIOD 
But there's another rare syndrome so rare ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that very few physicians have heard about it ,COMMA not even neurologists .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the most common interpretation of this ,COMMA which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks ,COMMA is a freudian view .PERIOD and that is that this chap -- and the same argument applies to women by the way ,COMMA but i'll just talk about guys 
Thank god ,COMMA or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother 
It's very ingenious ,COMMA as all freudian arguments are -- -- but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion ,COMMA a patient having the same delusion ,COMMA about his pet poodle .PERIOD 
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces .PERIOD 
Now when that area's damaged ,COMMA you lose the ability to see faces ,COMMA right 
And then the message cascades into the amygdala ,COMMA and then goes down the autonomic nervous system 
There's no delusion through the phone 
And in fact ,COMMA one student asked me the other day do they get phantom .PERIOD pms 
Now ,COMMA why would a phantom limb be paralyzed ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis ?QUESTIONMARK so you can relieve him of this excruciating ,COMMA clenching spasm of the phantom arm 
He had a brachial avulsion ,COMMA so the nerves were cut and the arm was paralyzed ,COMMA lying in a sling for a year .PERIOD and then the arm was amputated 
My first patient came in ,COMMA and he looked in the mirror ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA look at your reflection of your phantom 
He knows ,COMMA it's a mirror reflection ,COMMA but it's a vivid sensory experience .PERIOD 
And he says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA my phantom is moving again .PERIOD i don't believe this 
And then i said ,COMMA close your eyes 
So i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek -- well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA derek ,COMMA take it home and practice with it for a week or two 
I said ,COMMA what's gone 
These people muddle up their senses ,COMMA 
Why does this happen 
Now remember -- why does this happen 
And that is there is an abnormal gene ,COMMA a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring 
So every brain region is wired to every other region ,COMMA and these are trimmed down to create the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain .PERIOD 
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction ,COMMA meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki ,COMMA in your auditory cortex ,COMMA the hair cells being excited -- kiki ,COMMA mimics the visual inflection ,COMMA sudden inflection of that jagged shape .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is very important ,COMMA because what it's telling you is your brain is engaging in a primitive -- it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion ,COMMA but these photons in your eye are doing this shape and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern ,COMMA but the brain is able to extract the common denominator .PERIOD 
Sorry about that 
My talk will be in two parts .PERIOD i'll talk first as an astronomer ,COMMA and then ,COMMA as a worried member of the human race ,COMMA 
So that's another project for nasa 
It landed on the surface .PERIOD this is pictures taken on the way down 
There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron ,COMMA the building blocks of planets and of life 
And until we have that synthesis ,COMMA we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe .PERIOD because when our universe was itself ,COMMA the size of an atom .PERIOD quantum effects could shake everything 
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small ,COMMA but we want to understand the very complex 
We depend on stars to make the atoms ,COMMA we're made of 
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .PERIOD 
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms ,COMMA within a factor of two of the mass of each person here 
If i was not a self-effacing brit .PERIOD i would mention the book myself ,COMMA and i would add that it's available in paperback 
First any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones .PERIOD 
He persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell 
We need not just campaigning physicists ,COMMA but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well .PERIOD 
I wrote my book our final century as a scientist ,COMMA just a general scientist .PERIOD but there's one respect ,COMMA i think ,COMMA in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,COMMA and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future 
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture -- outside the american bible belt anyway -- but most people ,COMMA even those who are familiar with evolution ,COMMA aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead .PERIOD 
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond 
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar ,COMMA not just for 40 years ,COMMA but for the entire 45 billion-year history of our earth 
Then other things happened even more abruptly 
Right now ,COMMA he's in a forest in georgia 
The bonobo ,COMMA although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright ,COMMA just as we are 
Slim-bodied bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures .PERIOD 
This is kanzi ,COMMA and i in the forest 
We need more sticks too .PERIOD 
Good job 
Video kanzi now makes his tools ,COMMA just as our ancestors may have made them ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago -- by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other 
Kanzi's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors ,COMMA two-and-a-half million years ago .PERIOD 
She's also saying ,COMMA the name of that with her voice 
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor .PERIOD 
Ss very nice ,COMMA beautiful ;SEMICOLON panbanisha .PERIOD 
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram 
The next symbol ,COMMA panbanisha writes represents collar 
Researchers began to record what panbanisha said ,COMMA by writing lexigrams on the floor ,COMMA with chalk .PERIOD 
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON kanzi plays the xylophone .PERIOD using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies dr .PERIOD sue's singing 
Kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment ,COMMA which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities ,COMMA 
So we have a bi-species environment .PERIOD we call it a panhomoculture .PERIOD 
Here's a site ,COMMA which allows you to look at recovery spending in california 
In fact ,COMMA this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of datagov and datagovuk 
And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors like the threat level .PERIOD 
The light blue is refugee camps .PERIOD these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images] .PERIOD 
So if you've been involved in that at all ,COMMA i just wanted to say ,COMMA whatever you've been doing ,COMMA whether you've just been chanting ,COMMA raw data .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens ,COMMA it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .PERIOD 
Within a year congress funded huge weapons increases ,COMMA and we went from 1200 nuclear weapons to 20000 
Support for engineering math and science -- education in general -- boomed 
And so ,COMMA if you'll put up with this ,COMMA i would like to enlist your help with a first experiment today ,COMMA the experiment is -- and i notice ,COMMA by the way that when you applauded ,COMMA that you did it in a typical north american way ,COMMA that is ,COMMA you were raucous and incoherent ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what do we make of that first of all ,COMMA we know that you're all brilliant 
Do you need to be alive .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA that's a spooky thought ,COMMA right 
And you see that in nature 
Keep in mind that ,COMMA although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate ,COMMA what's really going on is a kind of selfish darwinian behavior 
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers .PERIOD 
As i say ,COMMA if you're in a swarm ,COMMA your odds of being the unlucky one are reduced as compared to a small group 
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this .PERIOD 
Specifically it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together in perfect synchrony .PERIOD to reinforce a message to the females 
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none .PERIOD 
But i hope you've convinced yourself .PERIOD now with this nighttime video that they really were very well synchronized 
Okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA the issue then is do we need to be alive to see this kind of spontaneous order .PERIOD and i've already hinted that the answer is no 
Now you might think that's a bizarre idea .PERIOD 
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss ,COMMA making a blade of light .PERIOD and then scamper across on this blade of light 
Think of the bridge as being like this platform ,COMMA 
Narrator ,COMMA the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison ,COMMA not only with each other ,COMMA but with the bridge 
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge 
But how could the crowd become synchronized 
Allan mcrobie ,COMMA is a bridge engineer from cambridge ,COMMA who wrote to me ,COMMA suggesting that a bridge simulator ,COMMA ought to wobble in the same way as the real bridge -- provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length 
Their instructions just walk normally 
That indeed a mass extinction was underway in our fields in our agricultural system ,COMMA 
So if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world ,COMMA and i had a slide like this ,COMMA and i switched it every second .PERIOD it would take up my entire ted talk ,COMMA and i wouldn't have to say anything 
And i said ,COMMA you know what these apples come from your ancestors ,COMMA and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor .PERIOD they could give them 
The bad news is they're extinct 
The coldest growing seasons of the future ,COMMA hotter than the hottest of the past 
And then there are just daily disasters .PERIOD that take place in these buildings ,COMMA financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things .PERIOD and every time something like this happens .PERIOD it means extinction ,COMMA we lose diversity 
Because quite literally ,COMMA if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change ,COMMA neither will we 
Important health message ,COMMA blogging may be hazardous to your health ,COMMA especially if you are a male 
This is male blogging posture sitting .PERIOD and the result is for greater comfort ,COMMA men naturally sit with their legs farther ,COMMA apart than women .PERIOD when working on laptop 
This is a very serious research that you should read the underline .PERIOD 
Wi-fi enables you to avoid the processor ,COMMA and there are some enhanced protection measures ,COMMA which i would like to share with you ,COMMA and i would like in a minute to thank philips for helping 
I'm really troubled by that ,COMMA but anyway ,COMMA that's -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later ,COMMA 
Aviation week asked me to make a list of who i thought were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what happened when i was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .PERIOD 
And this was at a time when mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now we thought ,COMMA there'd be animals there .PERIOD we knew there were plants there .PERIOD the colors change ,COMMA right 
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 
Here's the biggie ,COMMA and that is you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops ,COMMA and the government uses it 
Computers were used for artillery first .PERIOD then irs 
Keep that in mind ,COMMA i put down innovation -- i've looked for innovation cycles in space .PERIOD i found none 
And i think i want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company ,COMMA 
But i think once it does ,COMMA we will find solutions and very quickly ,COMMA you'll see those resort hotels in orbit 
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children ,COMMA this little three- to 15-year-old age ,COMMA by us ,COMMA going to orbit and going to the moon here ,COMMA right in this time .PERIOD period ,COMMA 
Paul allen .PERIOD elan musk .PERIOD richard branson :COLON jeff bezos ,COMMA the ansari family ,COMMA which is now funding the russians' sub-orbital thing :COLON bob bigelow ,COMMA a private space station and carmack 
There were a couple of examples here 
And i'm talking about if you've got a baby now ,COMMA or if you've got a 10-year-old ,COMMA now ,COMMA 
Relatively soon ,COMMA you'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance military operational airplane .PERIOD it's never happened before .PERIOD 
You can fly with russian hardware this is available ,COMMA because a russian space program is starving ,COMMA and it's nice for them to get 20 million here .PERIOD and there to take one of the seats 
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 .PERIOD and what that means is before ,COMMA we know it the progress in human space flight ,COMMA with no taxpayer dollars ,COMMA will be at a level of about five times as much as the current ,COMMA nasa budgets for human space flight 
And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis 
Now i'm going to focus on cancer ,COMMA because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer ,COMMA every type of cancer 
This is a tumor .PERIOD dark :COLON gray :COLON ominous mass growing inside a brain .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD judah folkman who was my mentor ,COMMA and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease ,COMMA 
And unfortunately ,COMMA this late stage of cancer is the one at which it's most likely to be diagnosed ,COMMA when angiogenesis is already turned on ,COMMA and cancer cells are growing like wild 
We call this antiangiogenic therapy ,COMMA and it's completely different from chemotherapy ,COMMA because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers 
Well ,COMMA i've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy 
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs 
It had already spread to his lymph nodes .PERIOD so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail .PERIOD so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs are already becoming available ,COMMA 
But the real question is how well do these work in practice ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA here's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .PERIOD 
But for other tumors and cancer types ,COMMA the improvements have only been modest 
And as a doctor ,COMMA i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage ,COMMA achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible 
But i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking .PERIOD what could we be adding to our diet ?QUESTIONMARK that's naturally ,COMMA antiangiogenic .PERIOD that could boost the body's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers 
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent 
And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent 
This means there's food synergy .PERIOD 
Here's some more data from our testing ,COMMA 
Now in the lab ,COMMA we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar 
Soy :COLON parsley ,COMMA garlic ,COMMA grapes berries .PERIOD i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .PERIOD 
And like a tumor ,COMMA fat grows when blood vessels grow 
Albert szent-gyorgi ,COMMA once said ,COMMA that discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking ,COMMA what no one has thought 
Right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer ,COMMA would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA there's abundant epidemiological evidence 
I've designed puzzles for books ,COMMA printed things 
But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression ,COMMA 
It's all figure 
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .PERIOD 
Now if you could pick up the black vase ,COMMA it would look like the figure on top 
Here let's make it a little harder .PERIOD still ,COMMA pretty easy .PERIOD 
I wanted to make a sequel 
Garry trudeau calls himself ,COMMA an investigative cartoonist 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how on earth ?QUESTIONMARK can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge ,COMMA 
But it takes some persistence 
First of all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a long time computer games meant things like doom where you're going around shooting things very violent games ,COMMA very fast aimed at teenage boys right .PERIOD that's who plays computer games .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA guess what that's changing 
And it's a game you play with other people 
A lot of people do sudoku in fact ,COMMA some doctors prescribe it .PERIOD 
Anybody 
What i want to talk about today is this particular cell or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us 
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .PERIOD 
And i want you imagine that at some point in history ,COMMA a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell ,COMMA the oppression of these cells ,COMMA the reinterpretation of these cells ,COMMA the undermining of these cells ,COMMA getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing ,COMMA eradicating ,COMMA destroying ,COMMA reducing these cells ,COMMA basically began the process of killing off the girl cell ,COMMA which was by the way ,COMMA patriarchy 
To be a leader means not to be a girl 
And i'd also like to say that the irony ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denying girl ,COMMA suppressing girl ,COMMA suppressing emotion ,COMMA refusing feeling has lead .PERIOD thus here 
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence ,COMMA the most horrific poverty ,COMMA genocide ,COMMA mass rapes ,COMMA the destruction of the earth is completely out of control 
In the congo ,COMMA for those of you who don't know there has been a war raging for the last 12 years ,COMMA a war that has killed .PERIOD nearly six million people 
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled ,COMMA and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically ,COMMA all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals ,COMMA so the west can have it and profit from them .PERIOD 
That shattering that opening of my girl cell ,COMMA that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous ,COMMA and braver ,COMMA and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life ,COMMA 
I want to change the verb 
I want the verb to be educate ,COMMA or activate ,COMMA or engage or confront ,COMMA or defy ,COMMA or create 
I know a 14-year-old girl ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself .PERIOD 
And i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in bukavu who was impregnated by her rapist 
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like ,COMMA and what a mutilated vagina looked like 
And she said ,COMMA well ,COMMA now i need a house 
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing 
She imagined her father killing her on one hand .PERIOD and mama ,COMMA agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house 
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled 
In that hut ,COMMA we walked in and her father and his four wives were sitting there ,COMMA and her sisters who had just returned ,COMMA because they had all fled when she had fled .PERIOD and her primary mother ,COMMA who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders 
And that is the power of transformation ,COMMA 
But i really want to do it for each ,COMMA and every person here to value the girl in us to value the part that cries to value the part that's emotional to value .PERIOD the part that's vulnerable to understand .PERIOD that's where the future lies .PERIOD 
I rejoice that it's still in my body 
I am an emotional creature 
I can take you back 
Nothing's been diluted 
I love hear me ,COMMA i love that i can feel the feelings inside you ,COMMA even if they stop my life ,COMMA even if they break my heart ,COMMA even if they take me off track ,COMMA they make me responsible 
Your body is covered with fractals 
Let's see first iteration .PERIOD second .PERIOD third .PERIOD fourth .PERIOD 
So native americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry .PERIOD 
It is not the same pattern at two different scales .PERIOD 
In some cases there would actually be algorithms and very sophisticated algorithms .PERIOD 
So i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things ,COMMA this guy in mali ,COMMA just outside of bamako ,COMMA and i asked him how come you're making fractal fences because nobody else is 
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology 
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry .PERIOD it was in a symbolic code .PERIOD and this was bamana sand .PERIOD divination 
And finally out of desperation ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let me explain georg cantor in 1877 
And then you take this symbol ,COMMA and you put it back in so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols 
And i know brian eno ,COMMA says there's not enough africa in computers .PERIOD but you know ,COMMA i don't think there's enough african history in brian eno ,COMMA 
We got a small seed grant just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this .PERIOD we're very excited about the future possibilities for that 
Actually the reason that google was such a success is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web .PERIOD

Anyway ,COMMA i like oprah -- i like her girlfriendy-ness ,COMMA i like her weight issues i like how she's transformed talk television ,COMMA i like how she's brought reading back to america -- but there was something that happened .PERIOD the last two weeks that was i call it .PERIOD the soon-yi moment it is the moment when i cannot continue supporting someone 
It makes what the bleep do ,COMMA we know seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is 
I want to try to share just a little bit of that ,COMMA with you in this presentation ,COMMA 
The challenge ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to answer this question ,COMMA what permits this extraordinary performance of animals that allows them basically to go anywhere 
And if we could figure that out ,COMMA how can we implement those designs 
Think about it ,COMMA if you were an engineer ,COMMA and i told you that you had to build an automobile ,COMMA but it had to start off to be this big ,COMMA then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way 
Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile ,COMMA i'll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile 
They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick .PERIOD how is that true ?QUESTIONMARK 
We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well .PERIOD we took their three legs .PERIOD we collapsed them down as one 
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all 
It has six legs -- there are the tuned ,COMMA springy legs 
Robert full ,COMMA it'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet ,COMMA but i'll talk about that later ,COMMA 
Like if we had a piece of tape ,COMMA now ,COMMA we'd peel it this way ,COMMA 
They do this with their toes ,COMMA it's bizarre .PERIOD this peeling inspired irobot -- that we work with -- to build mecho-geckos ,COMMA 
And here's the peeling action of the mecho-gecko 
Here's an individual hair with a little split end .PERIOD there 
No force is too low .PERIOD do they do it by electrostatics 
And just recently we've made a breakthrough where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic self-cleaning ,COMMA dry adhesive .PERIOD many companies are interested in this 
Thank you 
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong 
Most people have cooking fires in the world ,COMMA whether it's camel dung or wood 
And the problem is this women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
We also have another problem ,COMMA which is that women face harder choices ,COMMA between professional success and personal fulfillment .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year 
In the high-income part of our workforce ,COMMA in the people who end up at the top -- fortune 500 ceo jobs ,COMMA or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping out 
This is hard .PERIOD i feel guilty .PERIOD sometimes 
My brother is kind of busy 
Because what the data shows above all else is one thing ,COMMA which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women 
This is the complication 
And that's a problem ,COMMA because we have to make it as important a job ,COMMA because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home ,COMMA for people of both genders ,COMMA if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce .PERIOD 
Message number three ,COMMA don't leave before you leave 
And literally ,COMMA from that moment ,COMMA she doesn't raise her hand anymore .PERIOD she doesn't look for a promotion ,COMMA she doesn't take on the new project .PERIOD she doesn't say me .PERIOD i want to do that 
My generation really ,COMMA sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top 
If you want to get at the big part -- i mean ,COMMA from a public health level ,COMMA where my training is -- you're looking at behavioral issues 
We talk about it in terms of engagement ,COMMA or non-compliance 
So ,COMMA the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making -- giving information to people in a form that doesn't just educate them or inform them ,COMMA but actually leads them to make better decisions ,COMMA better choices in their lives .PERIOD 
So they asked them at the beginning ,COMMA do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program 
So fear showed up as not really the driver 
It was a notion that really came out of albert bandura's work ,COMMA who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .PERIOD 
It's an amazing notion 
And i had to explain they're trying to scare people .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA bandura recognized this years ago ,COMMA decades ago ,COMMA 
Okay ,COMMA i know where i sit ,COMMA i know where i'm situated 
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers -- this overload of health information that we're inundated with 
Finally ,COMMA we need to be presented with a clear point of action 
The choice .PERIOD in this case is pretty simple 
We either keep going fast ,COMMA or we slow down 
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent 
They last for about five miles ,COMMA in which case we put our foot back on the pedal 
And who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it 
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal works for our food ,COMMA actually helps people understand what's in their food 
They're just not for us .PERIOD they're not for people .PERIOD they're not for patients .PERIOD 
This is the worst presented information 
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do 
So we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page ,COMMA which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it 
The last one i'll show you is a psa test 
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes ,COMMA 
Okay ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA by placing your finger in a different position on the fingerboard it changes the string length that changes the frequency of the sound wave 
And now i realize that as the musician ,COMMA we human beings ,COMMA we have a great mind ,COMMA artistic heart and skill that can change the 16th-century technology and a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA although some of them were quite up there for me ,COMMA 
And i realized we actually had quite a bit in common .PERIOD both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another .PERIOD and both of us -- probably if i can imagine the bee's point of view -- thought we were calling the shots 
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are that we are sovereign subjects in nature .PERIOD the bee as well as me 
And that's when i got the idea ,COMMA which was well ,COMMA what would happen if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us 
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me ,COMMA not as an invention ,COMMA not as a human technology .PERIOD but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species ,COMMA mostly edible grasses ,COMMA had exploited us figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world 
And suddenly everything looked different 
I'm a dupe .PERIOD i'm a dupe of the lawns ,COMMA whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees ,COMMA who they compete with for sunlight 
So let me go through what you gain when you look at the world ,COMMA this way ,COMMA besides some entertaining insights about human desire .PERIOD 
As an intellectual matter looking at the world from other species' points of view helps us deal with this weird anomaly ,COMMA which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history -- which is that we have this darwinian revolution .PERIOD 150 years ago ,COMMA 
This is a farm in the shenandoah valley of virginia ,COMMA 
The idea is ,COMMA he's got six different species of animals as well as some plants growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement 
And i'll show you if you take this approach ,COMMA what you get ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
So one day cattle in a pen 
The eggmobile is a very rickety contraption -- it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards -- but it houses ,COMMA 350 chickens ,COMMA 
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs ,COMMA and in the process they're spreading the manure out 
And within four or five weeks ,COMMA he can do it again 
Put that in play 
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass ,COMMA they shed roots .PERIOD they kind of cauterize them and the roots die 
And they're labeled by color right now by language ,COMMA 
But you can also see there are places where there's not so much 
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the us 
And so ,COMMA i guess the us ,COMMA finally finally started to like it ,COMMA too ,COMMA 
And it's something i'm very excited to be a part of 
But it was a dream of his ,COMMA and we basically ,COMMA when people really want to do something ,COMMA well ,COMMA we generally let them 
You can see ,COMMA even though the us is still the majority here -- though ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA search-wise ,COMMA it's only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it's already going to japan and the uk and europe ,COMMA and all the rest of the countries 
And -- well ,COMMA i'll leave you in suspense 
So one of the things -- both sergey ,COMMA and i went to a montessori school .PERIOD and i think ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA this has been incorporated in google 
And sergey mentioned orkut ,COMMA which is something that you know ,COMMA orkut wanted to do in his time .PERIOD and we call this -- at google ,COMMA we've embodied this as the 20 percent time .PERIOD and the idea is for 20 percent of your time .PERIOD if you're working at google ,COMMA you can do what you think is the best thing to do 
And this was kind of a surprise to me ,COMMA but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head ,COMMA which you did ,COMMA by writing them down that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources 
So this is a new -- how many of you use the google toolbar 
And the nice thing about this ,COMMA we have a self-serve program ,COMMA and many thousands of websites have signed up .PERIOD and this ,COMMA let's them really make money .PERIOD and i -- you know ,COMMA there's a number of people i met -- i met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i wasn't making any money 
And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sleeping a lot 
And i think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search ,COMMA and i think that's a tremendous tremendous benefit .PERIOD 
So i'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world .PERIOD 
It's not very good .PERIOD it's cluttered 
If you're not too bad ,COMMA there's nothing you can do 
It's actually about using dynamics ,COMMA using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there ,COMMA how you do it 
Come here at a certain time ,COMMA get your drinks half off 
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior .PERIOD it's influenced our entire culture 
They will return like clockwork at different times .PERIOD 
Modern warfare ,COMMA one of the most successful selling games of all time .PERIOD 
It's also used in more conventional settings and can be used more consciously in conventional settings 
School -- and remember ,COMMA i made it through one year .PERIOD so i think i'm qualified to talk on school -- is a game .PERIOD it's just not a terribly well-designed game ,COMMA right 
There are statuses .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA what is valedictorian ,COMMA but a status 
That sucks ?QUESTIONMARK why not level-up 
And it's very powerful 
I mean ,COMMA you see this is a paladin level 10 ,COMMA and that's a paladin level 20 .PERIOD and if you were going to fight ,COMMA you know ,COMMA orcs on the fields of mordor against the raz al ghul ,COMMA you'd probably want to be the bigger one ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Their most dedicated players ,COMMA it's like a full-time job 
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over by doing challenges ,COMMA by engaging with the business ,COMMA you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen .PERIOD and you eventually unlock rewards .PERIOD 
So we have to use this one carefully 
It's a woodworking machine ,COMMA or at least a piece of one ,COMMA and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern ,COMMA a little bit easier to use 
Now this gentleman isambard kingdom brunel designed many great things in his career in the 19th century ,COMMA including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe 
His greatest creation runs actually right through here in oxford ,COMMA 
He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york 
And i'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes ,COMMA 
So it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service 
And the faster we do that the faster our ideas evolve 
This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs .PERIOD 
They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients ,COMMA using a simple software tool 
And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone ,COMMA 
But again ,COMMA we are in the midst of massive change 
How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people ,COMMA and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers 
What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle 
There is a hash tag there that you can use .PERIOD #cbdq 
Well ,COMMA since i couldn't have my tea ,COMMA the way i wanted it .PERIOD i ordered a cup of coffee ,COMMA which the waiter brought over promptly 
But from the japanese perspective ,COMMA it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better -- in this case ,COMMA the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice 
As i do ,COMMA so i hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds .PERIOD 
It is essential for success 
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do ,COMMA and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with 
In reality ,COMMA the kids who were told what to do whether by miss smith ,COMMA or their mothers were actually given the very same activity ,COMMA which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen 
In fact ,COMMA some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted 
The first-generation children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents' approach to choice .PERIOD 
Or you could say that the individual's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others .PERIOD 
Americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference 
A number of my studies have shown that when you give people 10 or more options ,COMMA when they're making a choice ,COMMA they make poorer decisions ,COMMA whether it be health care ,COMMA investment ,COMMA other critical areas .PERIOD 
They'd already picked out a name for her barbara ,COMMA after her grandmother ,COMMA 
Unable to breathe on her own ,COMMA she was put on a ventilator 
This narrative promises so much freedom ,COMMA happiness success 
Instead of replacing one story with another ,COMMA we can learn from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written 
No matter where we're from ,COMMA and what your narrative is ,COMMA we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do .PERIOD and what it can represent 
It brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises ,COMMA but doesn't always deliver 
So i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory ,COMMA and i stripped ,COMMA the labels off 
Well ,COMMA good morning 
And it's not just what these are doing to each other ,COMMA but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter ,COMMA 
To get a sense of this ,COMMA and it's been a theme .PERIOD we've talked about all week .PERIOD i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners 
Girl 5 ,COMMA because they're going to lose all their money .PERIOD eventually 
Doesn't work out too well for them ,COMMA they lose money 
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at 
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory ,COMMA the velocity ,COMMA you will notice has dropped off to a minimum 
But like ,COMMA let's imagine we took the latest pentium processor ,COMMA the latest core 2 extreme ,COMMA which is a four-core processor that intel's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow .PERIOD 
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs 
Every effort has been made ,COMMA and will continue to be made to find a new pattern ,COMMA new selling arrangements and new types of programs .PERIOD that may arrest the declining revenues 
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio ,COMMA but i don't know how 
It was the dawn of interactive tv ,COMMA and you may have noticed they wanted to sell .PERIOD you the winky dink kits 
Pete ,COMMA i could use any ordinary open-source crayon ,COMMA why do i have to buy theirs ?QUESTIONMARK 
But we will discuss this scandal ,COMMA because this man ,COMMA jack berry ,COMMA the host of winky dink went on to become the host of twenty one ,COMMA one of the most important quiz shows ever 
We'll talk a little bit more about him later ,COMMA 
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing 
It all happened within five miles of where i'm standing at stanford university between 1960 and 1975 ,COMMA 
Hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks ,COMMA where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system ,COMMA and we had no way of explaining it 
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians 
And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry .PERIOD and the re-regulation of the cable television industry ,COMMA 
Voice 2 next on the gourmet pet channel ,COMMA decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer 
We come into the era of the dotcom ,COMMA the world wide web ,COMMA and i don't need to tell you about that ,COMMA because we all went through that bubble together .PERIOD 
Voice 1 ,COMMA you'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word .PERIOD the terrorist threat is over 
And media companies realize the audience is important .PERIOD also 
And i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business 
They think of the old medium ,COMMA because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv .PERIOD and as books used to be the content ,COMMA novels used to be the content of movies ,COMMA 
And i used three criteria .PERIOD the first was ,COMMA i thought i'd talk about real design within reach design .PERIOD that's free ,COMMA not design not quite within reach as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors .PERIOD but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages 
Wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york 
How did i get started in this business 
In italy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA almost everything kind of looks good 
I've come across some other ,COMMA just kind of ,COMMA curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations ,COMMA but -- these things amuse me 
And i came down one day ,COMMA and all the bikes were red .PERIOD 
And at that moment ,COMMA the sun came out .PERIOD and through this perforated screen ,COMMA a pattern was cast over these bodies ,COMMA and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling ,COMMA ok ,COMMA about stuff .PERIOD 
Cities are the place where we're most likely to encounter diversity ,COMMA and to mix with other people 
And it's a welcoming area ,COMMA i think ,COMMA inclusive of diversity ,COMMA reflective of diversity .PERIOD and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the us 
And i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes ,COMMA 
You had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air 
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics ,COMMA and all this sort of thing 
So i chose furniture 
And i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them 
There are drawbacks to this 
One is ,COMMA you can't accommodate everybody .PERIOD 
So he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i'll come over and look at it 
So here we are 
So if you watch this chair as i recline ,COMMA the headrest comes up to meet my neck .PERIOD 
You cant hit your elbow on bottom .PERIOD 
What does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK my environment 
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places ,COMMA 
You spend it at rest ,COMMA and you spend it at work 
So then i decided to leave that part of the world ,COMMA and i was going to go to the mid-west 
Very nice .PERIOD and there my older senior lungs ,COMMA as i like to call them ,COMMA i filled with particulate matter ,COMMA carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone 
Okay ,COMMA almost like the highest in the nation 
So what's wrong with this picture 
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth or the food that i ingest into my stomach 
Now ,COMMA i've circled the places where i've been 
Oh not so lucky 
They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck 
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa 
This is what the physician would have in front of him ,COMMA and her when we enter that exam room ,COMMA instead of just the pink slip ,COMMA that said ,COMMA i paid at the counter right 
And i believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy .PERIOD thank you 
So 
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriagedad 
I'd be like some kind of internet genius and me ,COMMA i'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop -- i'd go wireless 
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise as wild ,COMMA and as organized as i think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get ,COMMA but ooh-eee ,COMMA you want to bet ,COMMA just how whack and un-pc your mac or pc is going to be when i'm rocking .PERIOD hot-shit-hot-shot-godnet 
You don't say a prayer 
Thank you ted 
So for roughly 300 years the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five ,COMMA or the number ,COMMA seven was a better proportion to think about architecture ,COMMA because the nose was one-fifth of your head ,COMMA or because your head was one-seventh of your body 
So whenever you lost information ,COMMA you'd move to symmetry ,COMMA whenever you added information to a system ,COMMA you would break symmetry 
Now ,COMMA the only way we could design that or possibly construct it ,COMMA is by using a calculus-based definition of the form 
It also is much more dynamic ,COMMA so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way ,COMMA as you move across it ,COMMA because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it 
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way .PERIOD 
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects ,COMMA but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses 
So working with bentley and microstation ,COMMA we've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information ,COMMA so that if we change any element along the length of the building ,COMMA not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses ,COMMA but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building ,COMMA 
But what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components .PERIOD one to another 
At the same time ,COMMA there's a person paying 30000 dollars for a 300-series car ,COMMA and a person paying 70000 dollars for a 700 series .PERIOD and that person paying more than double doesn't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car 
So they have to also discriminate between these products 
To go back to architecture ,COMMA what's organic about architecture as a field ,COMMA unlike product design is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm .PERIOD 
And to do that ,COMMA we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system 
With united architects also ,COMMA we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system ,COMMA but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere ,COMMA 
So for these interiors ,COMMA like this shop in stockholm ,COMMA sweden ,COMMA or this installation wall ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA at the netherlands ,COMMA architecture institute ,COMMA we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects ,COMMA and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material 
What i'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter ,COMMA and actually all the way down into the sewer because i want to talk about diarrhea ,COMMA 
And in particular ,COMMA i want to talk about the design of diarrhea ,COMMA 
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility ,COMMA then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the milder organisms ,COMMA 
So one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria and see whether or not the ones that tend to be more transmitted by water ,COMMA tend to be more harmful .PERIOD 
After a few days of infection ,COMMA you end up having -- the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine 
And if you took a drop of that water ,COMMA you might find a million diarrheal organisms ,COMMA 
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin ,COMMA then you might find a smaller number 
So the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission ,COMMA thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted by person-to-person contact ,COMMA or person-food-person contact -- both of which would really require that people be mobile and fairly healthy for transmission .PERIOD 
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism -- some that produce a lot of toxins ,COMMA some that produce a little -- and take those strains and spew them out in different countries .PERIOD 
So we don't want to run an experiment like that 
Now ,COMMA i don't know how that happened ,COMMA and i didn't have anything to do with it .PERIOD i promise you 
The goal is to turn this around 
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply ,COMMA you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance .PERIOD 
And i want to give you just one more example ,COMMA because we've talked a little bit about malaria 
In the case of malaria ,COMMA what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses ,COMMA 
The only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough to walk outside and get mosquito bites .PERIOD 
So i don't really have time to talk about those things ,COMMA but i did want to put them up there .PERIOD just to give you a sense that there really are solutions to controlling the evolution of harmfulness of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with 
And the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness 
Anyhow ,COMMA i'll end that there .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD 
Our hands are amazing instruments .PERIOD 
And when they're missing ,COMMA it's a barrier ,COMMA 
Every time you contract a muscle .PERIOD it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis 
Well ,COMMA the body works by starting a motor command in your brain ,COMMA going down your spinal cord out the nerves and to your periphery .PERIOD 
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it 
Now ,COMMA you think close hand and a little section of your chest contracts ,COMMA 
And jesse's a good crane operator ,COMMA and he did okay ,COMMA by our standards .PERIOD 
So this is really exciting for us .PERIOD because now we have a portal ,COMMA a portal ,COMMA or a way to potentially give back sensation ,COMMA so that he might feel what he touches ,COMMA with his prosthetic hand ,COMMA 
We've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above-the-elbow amputations 
You had to concentrate a whole lot 
Then we fit her with a prosthesis 
A little faster and much more easy ,COMMA much more natural 
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals ,COMMA and we wanted to get more 
And here you can see on jesse's chest when he just tried to do three different things .PERIOD you can see three different patterns 
Obviously that's heavy for amanda ,COMMA 
It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train 
So we're really excited because now we're getting to a clinically practical device 
I want you to watch closely 
That's claudia .PERIOD and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic 
Once we can do it that small .PERIOD it's a lot easier making them bigger .PERIOD 
So amanda came jet-lagged ,COMMA she's using the arm ,COMMA and everything goes wrong .PERIOD 
And none of those problems could i have dealt with ,COMMA but i have a really bright research team 
But first ,COMMA i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans ,COMMA and for the earth ,COMMA 
Because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled -- but we have 67 billion people in the world ,COMMA and we all like to consume 
Humans without fins ,COMMA 90 meters ,COMMA 35 minutes ,COMMA 
So penguins are amazing athletes ,COMMA 
And more importantly ,COMMA they're well-dressed 
If you go and do it now ,COMMA the national parks count about 500 
So we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago ,COMMA 
When we have extreme el nino ,COMMA events you see all this red ,COMMA and you see no green out here around the galapagos 
Things die when there's no food 
And if you look along the coast of argentina ,COMMA where i work now at a place called punta tombo -- the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees ,COMMA south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here 
And so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins .PERIOD 
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it 
So we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA all of this then leads to a vicious cycle ,COMMA and you can't raise a lot of chicks .PERIOD 
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak .PERIOD we let him in .PERIOD and he comes in here ,COMMA 
So this is turbo 
And now he's looking at the other guy saying ,COMMA you are really weird 
Most important thing is only you can change yourself ,COMMA and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins .PERIOD 
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born .PERIOD 
Over 50 new countries were born 
And they share ,COMMA a lengthy land border 
In fact ,COMMA the world bank predicts that russia's population is declining towards about 120 million people .PERIOD and there is another thing that you don't see on this map 
Stalin ,COMMA khrushchev and other soviet leaders forced russians out to the far east to be in gulags ,COMMA labor camps .PERIOD nuclear cities ,COMMA whatever the case was 
As a result in the russian far east today ,COMMA which is twice the size of india .PERIOD you have exactly six million russians .PERIOD 
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography 
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy 
And now many of you have been reading in the news ,COMMA how people are looking to china to lead the rebound ,COMMA the economic rebound ,COMMA not just in asia ,COMMA but potentially for the world 
So china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region ,COMMA 
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region 
All of this is happening ,COMMA without firing a shot ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world 
What i want to present to you is what i call state building day by day ,COMMA 
The kurds for 3000 years have been waging a struggle for independence .PERIOD and now is their chance to finally have it 
Now remember kurdistan is landlocked 
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them ,COMMA 
The lesson from kurdistan ,COMMA and from palestine .PERIOD is that independence alone .PERIOD without infrastructure .PERIOD is futile .PERIOD 
The last time that was the case was actually a century ago during the ottoman empire 
But today ,COMMA the hejaz railway lies in tatters ,COMMA ruins 
More pipelines means more silk roads ,COMMA instead of the great game 
In 2004 15 new countries ,COMMA joined the eu 
Even if these regions aren't part of the eu ,COMMA they are becoming part of its sphere of influence 
So ,COMMA what's next ,COMMA where are we going to see borders change and new countries born 
If we were to look at all of africa ,COMMA we could most certainly acknowledge far more tribal divisions and so forth .PERIOD 
It has three ongoing civil wars ,COMMA the genocide in darfur ,COMMA which you all know about the civil war in the east of the country and south sudan ,COMMA 
But if you look in nature ,COMMA you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans 
Now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes 
And we didn't study any of these animals 
Is it miserable ,COMMA it doesn't seem to be 
And if you look at the tissues of the animal ,COMMA they're starting to deteriorate 
And now here is the daf-2 mutant 
But it's really more like this .PERIOD let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s -- and you're a bachelor and you're dating people 
She says ,COMMA i'm 60 
Well ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA genes ,COMMA which are part of the dna ,COMMA they're instructions to make a protein that does something 
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes ,COMMA and specifically by hormones ,COMMA 
So after we made our discoveries with little c .PERIOD elegans ,COMMA people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking ,COMMA if we made the same daf-2 mutation ,COMMA the hormone receptor mutation ,COMMA in other animals ,COMMA will they live longer 
They hardly get cancer ,COMMA and when they do ,COMMA it's not as severe 
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that i have the x drawn here ,COMMA through the receptor ,COMMA 
The receptor isn't working as well 
And many of these different genes ,COMMA we've shown actually contribute to the long .PERIOD lifespan of the daf-2 mutant 
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients 
So he doesn't actually do anything himself 
We don't know the details of how this works ,COMMA but we do know ,COMMA then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people 
But in this case there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity .PERIOD 
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected 
You could change the genes in principle 
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .PERIOD 
I wasn't suggesting that i was going to go and do it ,COMMA but 
Just move to one side for us ,COMMA if you would 
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles ,COMMA you can't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles 
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses 
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan 
Here's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .PERIOD 
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat .PERIOD maybe read a book ,COMMA maybe see a movie ,COMMA but not be engaged in their community .PERIOD 
They all have heroes who were chosen 
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders ,COMMA because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about 
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead ,COMMA or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy .PERIOD they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership ,COMMA which is that it comes from within 
Which leads us to the last one ,COMMA which is our elections .PERIOD 
So i was privileged to train in transplantation .PERIOD under two great surgical pioneers ,COMMA thomas starzl ,COMMA who performed the world's first successful liver transplant in 1967 and sir roy calne ,COMMA who performed the first liver transplant in the uk .PERIOD 
In the following year 
But not all patients on the transplant wait list .PERIOD are so fortunate 
And the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living ,COMMA related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ ,COMMA or a part of an organ ,COMMA like a split liver graft ,COMMA to a relative or loved one 
No doubt ,COMMA i was informed .PERIOD the consent had been obtained .PERIOD 
And at that time ,COMMA stem cell research had gained momentum ,COMMA following the isolation of the world's first human .PERIOD embryonic stem cells in the 1990s .PERIOD 
And as it turns out ,COMMA fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells 
If this research is successful ,COMMA it may then reduce the need to research and sacrifice human embryos 
It is a fact that when our organs or tissues are injured ,COMMA our bone marrow releases stem cells into our circulation 
There are 170 clinical trials investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease ,COMMA 
We are very happy ,COMMA because we have the opportunity to have this angel in the world -- not only in our country ,COMMA venezuela ,COMMA but in our world ,COMMA 
He has given us the possibility to have dreams ,COMMA and to make true ,COMMA the dreams 
And here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in venezuela ,COMMA 
He buys a ring .PERIOD she buys a dress .PERIOD 
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb .PERIOD weight gain ,COMMA until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace ,COMMA 
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others' company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore ,COMMA 
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common 
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends ,COMMA 
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because ,COMMA women ,COMMA we care a great deal about being thin and good looking ,COMMA whereas men ,COMMA mostly care about sex 
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising ,COMMA we just need to wait for them to get fat ,COMMA maybe bake a few pies 
These are couples who can find good in any situation 
This is an actual study .PERIOD and let me clarify 
Now ,COMMA i don't know how old all of you are .PERIOD but when i was a kid ,COMMA your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film .PERIOD and by god ,COMMA film was expensive 
I'm serious 
So i'm obviously going to need fatten him up 
I have a doppelganger 
That's exactly what i do -- optical mind control 
Even if we could measure what every cell is doing at all times ,COMMA we would still have to make sense of the recorded activity patterns ,COMMA and that's so difficult .PERIOD chances are we'll understand these patterns ,COMMA just as little as the brains that produce them 
To make progress ,COMMA we need to break the code 
The approach works ,COMMA so well that we can write purely artificial messages directly to the brain .PERIOD 
These headless bodies can live for about a day ,COMMA but they don't do much 
Now for an intelligent being like our fly .PERIOD this policy is not written in stone ,COMMA but rather changes as the animal learns from experience 
So we bred flies whose brains were more or less randomly peppered with cells that were light addressable .PERIOD 
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint ,COMMA it pauses ,COMMA it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment ,COMMA and then it turns around 
These 12 cells as shown here in green ,COMMA send the output to a brain structure called the mushroom body ,COMMA which is shown here in gray 
If the connection is strong ,COMMA the motors will turn on ,COMMA and the fly will initiate a turn .PERIOD 
In a situation like this ,COMMA we would expect the critic to speak up .PERIOD and to tell the actor ,COMMA to change its policy ,COMMA 
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again .PERIOD the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in terms of biomimetics ,COMMA as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature ,COMMA nature becomes a much more useful teacher ,COMMA 
Now being a biologist ,COMMA i was very curious about this 
These are gecko toes .PERIOD 
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends ,COMMA 
So what they did was they asked us an important question 
They're climbing up a wall or a tree 
Now that's real time .PERIOD you can't see anything 
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around 
Okay ,COMMA there it goes 
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin 
But watch its front legs .PERIOD can you see what they are doing 
So now we were really confused ,COMMA because there are no reports of it gliding 
One of the problems is coming up with the right target 
There's not a lot of science behind that one either 
Now ?QUESTIONMARK why is this so complicated 
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere ,COMMA 
So here's the thing it sounds like a simple question .PERIOD 
That's the ross sea ice shelf on the right there 
You can go ,COMMA then and study corals and figure out how often do you see this 
And it been growing for about 600 years ,COMMA 
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right 
That the place where during an earthquake in 1954 ,COMMA this marine terrace was lifted up out of the ocean very quickly .PERIOD and it was lifted up about six to seven meters 
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet .PERIOD 
There's a whole family of curves here .PERIOD 
Some of the records show ,COMMA lower temperatures than others 
And there is natural variability caused by the sun ,COMMA caused by el ninos ,COMMA 
There's consequences for carbonate organisms 
The main framework material of coral reefs is calcium carbonate .PERIOD 
And on coral reefs ,COMMA where some of the main framework organisms disappear .PERIOD we will see a major loss of marine biodiversity 
You know ,COMMA these are things that we have good physiological reasons to expect to see stressed caused by this transience ,COMMA 
You have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .PERIOD 
That's the reason that they're not able to respond ,COMMA or adapt to this rapid acidification that's going on right now 
And i think that may very well ,COMMA be true .PERIOD so i'll close with this 
And a long time ago -- well ,COMMA about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student 
This is donna at the statue of liberty .PERIOD 
But i'd like to talk about another way to travel ,COMMA that doesn't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera ,COMMA a projector and a screen 
And that's what i'm going to talk to you about today ,COMMA 
So i'm the living product of two cultures coming together .PERIOD 
To change the arab nightmare into the american dream 
Josh rushing the night they showed the pows and the dead soldiers -- al jazeera showed them -- it was powerful because america doesn't show those kinds of images 
And it upset me on a profound level that i wasn't bothered as much the night before ,COMMA 
Jehane noujaim :COLON i was overwhelmed by the response of the film for we didn't know whether it would be able to get out there 
And i saw this with audiences 
Man ,COMMA god forbid 
If you were not abu azzam's daughter 
In this life ,COMMA we're dead .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA 
Woman ,COMMA perhaps we have to turn it into a moral war .PERIOD 
Zvika ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA that's bat-chen .PERIOD that's my daughter .PERIOD 
Are you sure she is dead 
When we got to here ,COMMA we saw three .PERIOD israeli military jeeps parked on the side of the road .PERIOD 
George ,COMMA but there is a teacher that is in charge .PERIOD 
But after thinking logically about it ,COMMA i didn't find any reason why not to meet them ,COMMA and let them know of our suffering 
We see that there are palestinians who suffered a lot who lost children and still believe ,COMMA in the peace process and in reconciliation .PERIOD 
Yes .PERIOD yes 
But i've been trying to think about ways to give power to these independent voices to give power to the filmmakers to give power to people who are trying to use film for change 
There's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace ,COMMA and documenting that process and getting interviews out there ,COMMA and using this film to take to congress to show that it's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who's had her daughter killed in an attack .PERIOD and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this 
There's working films and there's current tv ,COMMA which is an incredible platform for people around the world ,COMMA to be able to put their -- yes ,COMMA it's amazing .PERIOD 
There are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there 
In the year 1919 ,COMMA a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold ,COMMA and in some ways ,COMMA a very bizarre idea .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason ,COMMA we don't yet see 
How is it that the sun ?QUESTIONMARK 93 million miles away ,COMMA [that] somehow it affects the motion of the earth 
He like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory ,COMMA 
Maybe i can play the same game with the other known force ,COMMA which was at that time ,COMMA known as the electromagnetic force -- we know of others today .PERIOD but at that time ,COMMA that was the only other one people were thinking about 
Now ,COMMA but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded ,COMMA two questions immediately arise from his observation 
It's very hard to see it though ,COMMA from far away 
So many people worked on it ,COMMA but by the '40s ,COMMA certainly by the '50s ,COMMA this strange ,COMMA but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away .PERIOD 
In our era ,COMMA a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists ,COMMA such as myself ,COMMA many others around the world ,COMMA it's called superstring theory .PERIOD as you were indicating 
And there ,COMMA you see unification because matter particles ,COMMA electrons and quarks ,COMMA radiation particles ,COMMA photons ,COMMA gravitons ,COMMA are all built up from one entity 
One of the other predictions of string theory -- no ,COMMA that's not one of the other predictions of string theory 
And that question is this ,COMMA when we look around the world as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe 
Not yet 
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions 
This is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape -- name isn't all that important .PERIOD 
But as you can see the extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape .PERIOD interesting structure 
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like ,COMMA then the microscopic landscape of our universe .PERIOD all around us would look like this on the tiniest of scales ,COMMA 
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime ,COMMA 
And yet ,COMMA even at this ,COMMA most fundamental level context is everything 
And now you see it 
There is no ,COMMA a priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a 
So you don't do it again 
Your brain is learning ,COMMA and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination .PERIOD the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .PERIOD 
I take it from your response .PERIOD they don't look the same anymore ,COMMA right 
Why because if the tile in that shadow were in fact ,COMMA in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow ,COMMA it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics 
Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions .PERIOD 
And they land on the flower .PERIOD they stick their tongue in there ,COMMA called a proboscis ,COMMA and they drink sugar water 
So they are using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle ,COMMA which is exactly what we do .PERIOD 
So illusions are often used ,COMMA especially in art .PERIOD in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses ,COMMA 
Instead color tells us something completely different that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world .PERIOD the way it is 
We can't instead the brain evolved to see the world ,COMMA the way it was useful to see in the past 
Well ,COMMA one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world 
So working with kids ,COMMA they created images thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them 
So now what i want to do ,COMMA i'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them 
The question is ,COMMA is that an illusion 
And they're different 
And you can make your own decision ,COMMA and then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it 
That's how you think about security -- in terms of the trade-off ,COMMA 
I'll give you the short answer 
Now ,COMMA most of the time that works 
We've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense 
The unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar 
If you hear a lot about tiger attacks ,COMMA there must be a lot of tigers around 
When something is so common .PERIOD it's no longer news -- car crashes ,COMMA domestic violence -- those are the risks .PERIOD you worry about 
There's no real word for stuff that makes us secure ,COMMA but doesn't make us feel secure .PERIOD 
And there are two ways to do this 
Enough real world examples helps 
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly .PERIOD 
If for example ,COMMA terrorism almost never happens .PERIOD it's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures 
It doesn't change .PERIOD it's real 
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them 
Where do we get these models ?QUESTIONMARK we get them from others .PERIOD 
Think of models of terrorism ,COMMA child kidnapping ,COMMA airline safety car safety 
Models can come from industry 
For us ,COMMA we're very facile around electricity .PERIOD 
Now it had a name ,COMMA which made it scarier than the regular flu ,COMMA even though it was more deadly 
As the novelty wore off ,COMMA the months went by there was some amount of tolerance .PERIOD people got used to it 
We have feeling model reality 
New models that extend long periods of time are hard 
Global warming is a great example 
Strong feelings can create a model 
And that's okay .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .PERIOD 
Remember i said ,COMMA feeling model reality .PERIOD i said ,COMMA reality doesn't change it actually does 
Someone else bought it and died .PERIOD 
All human life ,COMMA all life depends on plants .PERIOD 
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move ,COMMA because there might be cities and other things in the way 
So if all human life depends on plants ,COMMA doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them 
All the genetic information for future generations of plants are held in seeds 
So all around the world ,COMMA people are doing the same thing .PERIOD 
This is at least 100 times bigger 
How much does it cost 
The future research is ,COMMA how can we find the genetic and molecular markers for the viability of seeds without having to plant them every 10 years 
And it was found close to here .PERIOD stanford ,COMMA 
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes 
Couldn't do it could not wait 
Put it back 
They would walk around ,COMMA they would play with their skirts and pants 
The sales person ,COMMA that -- the customer says ,COMMA i want that ,COMMA and the person says ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here you are 
Then you sell a lot more 
The rules of engagement ,COMMA how to talk when to talk and how to deal with them 
We just have to persevere 
Everybody seems to agree with that 
But now ,COMMA as we prepare to talk ,COMMA we understand how little we know 
Should we talk to hamas 
Now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups 
But talking can be done in different ways 
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level 
In his memoirs ,COMMA long road to freedom .PERIOD he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity ,COMMA because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being also being a human being 
Now south african friends will know that was very painful .PERIOD 
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals not between groups ,COMMA not between governments -- but it is very necessary .PERIOD 
But that strategy seldom takes you very far 
We could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently ,COMMA by engaging with civil society ,COMMA 
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem ?QUESTIONMARK but part of the solution 
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups 
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication 
In my country ,COMMA i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together ,COMMA not as a government initiative ,COMMA but they came together on their own initiative ,COMMA to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key tension .PERIOD 
How are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our issues if we don't improve our skills of communication ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i'm in chile in the atacama desert sitting in a hotel lobby ,COMMA because that's the only place that i can get a wi-fi connection ,COMMA and i have this picture up on my screen .PERIOD and a woman comes up behind me 
And you know ,COMMA excuse me 
This is a gentoo penguin ,COMMA and she was still skeptical .PERIOD 
So one of the things that i love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites 
And one thing that isn't a mystery actually ,COMMA was when i grew up -- because when i was a little kid ,COMMA i'd seen these pictures -- and i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA why that look on the face 
In fact ,COMMA in many of the statues ,COMMA when you excavate them ,COMMA the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass ,COMMA smooth 
We're trying to get all of the permissions ,COMMA to get everything all set to get it going 
In this case we're working with a major medical foundation to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing diseases in developing countries .PERIOD 
Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to -- there's tremendous traditions ,COMMA there's secrecy 
And i'm trying to use a very scientific approach 
So i do a lot of work on dinosaurs 
Not the same one actually ,COMMA this is a cast ,COMMA which i had bought .PERIOD and then ,COMMA after buying the cast ,COMMA i found my own ,COMMA and i don't have room for two 
It's something that can inform all sorts of science in unexpected ways .PERIOD 
These days ,COMMA bits are cheap ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA that means you've got to spend more time sorting through them 
Then a little bit later ,COMMA i start getting some pictures like this 
That's kind of what it's like 
And you know ,COMMA when i was at microsoft ,COMMA that was so engrossing ,COMMA and the whole industry was expanding so much that it did tend to crowd out .PERIOD most of the other things in my life 
The sound made flicking a wall switch off ,COMMA is of a completely different nature .PERIOD 
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster 
That's the end of that 
Take-out sandwich shops ,COMMA film processing drop-offs ,COMMA peep-shows and necktie stores .PERIOD 
You were late for school again .PERIOD this morning 
We have fading memories of that provisional temple .PERIOD erected each time an adult sat down 
The next story is called the haverpiece collection ,COMMA a nondescript warehouse ,COMMA visible for a moment from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit 
Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries 
A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar 
And that this ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA will be the way that we treat cancer in the future 
It is very useful in certain circumstances .PERIOD 
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right 
You predict a black hole ,COMMA and you look out the telescope and there it is just like ,COMMA you said ,COMMA 
And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives ,COMMA but they may be surprising 
And applied minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems .PERIOD and i didn't think this was a very likely one to call back .PERIOD so i kept on giving him to the delay list 
And i'll show you what that protein measurement looks like ,COMMA 
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right ,COMMA is the weight of the fragments that we're getting .PERIOD and from top to bottom ,COMMA is how slippery they are .PERIOD 
And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA bump ,COMMA 
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive .PERIOD if doctors didn't do this 
Well ,COMMA it's in the kitchen .PERIOD oh ,COMMA you must have kitchen water 
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time ,COMMA but it's fixing them .PERIOD it's draining them out .PERIOD and so on ,COMMA 
And so i gave this talk and said ,COMMA why don't you guys do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health 
So thank you very much .PERIOD 
Now i want to tell you a quick story 
Super bowl ,COMMA i heard it over here .PERIOD it was the date of the super bowl 
And there were even some polls .PERIOD that were saying she was going to go all the way 
But when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes ,COMMA all across the united states ,COMMA 
But not just work ,COMMA it's within these tribes that societies get built that important things happen .PERIOD 
If you focus in on a group ,COMMA like this -- this happens to be a usc game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people .PERIOD you would ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA see not a single crowd just like there is not a single crowd here .PERIOD but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .PERIOD 
Not all tribes are the same .PERIOD and what makes the difference is the culture 
This is the kid who shot up virginia ,COMMA tech 
So this other book that steve mentioned ,COMMA that just came out called the three laws of performance ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA steve zaffron ,COMMA and i argue that as people see the world ,COMMA so they behave 
Well ,COMMA if people see the world in such a way that life sucks ,COMMA then their behavior will follow automatically from that 
Now my birthday is coming up shortly .PERIOD and my driver's license expires 
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen 
A whole group of people communicating that way talking that way 
Now we find these in places where really smart successful people show up 
It was not christmas time .PERIOD there was a christmas tree 
There is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA another stage 
There was no road map .PERIOD no one had ever done anything like this before ,COMMA 
And people at the time ,COMMA feared that south africa would end up going the way that rwanda has gone ,COMMA descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end 
What about martin luther king 
In fact .PERIOD martin luther king's most famous line was at stage three 
48 percent of working tribes ,COMMA say ,COMMA these are employed tribes ,COMMA say i'm great .PERIOD and you're not 
But you don't leave them where you found them .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
I don't know anybody 
We move people from stage one to stage two by getting them in a new tribe ,COMMA and then over time ,COMMA getting them connected 
But we're not done yet ,COMMA because then how do we go from stage four ,COMMA which is great to stage five 
Incidentally ,COMMA they did pull it off 
And they released the first-ever world poll .PERIOD 
We're here to celebrate compassion .PERIOD 
But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all .PERIOD the great virtues 
And in that light for the religious ,COMMA compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us ,COMMA not just to see beauty ,COMMA but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering .PERIOD in the face of a stranger ,COMMA in the face of the vibrant religious other 
The communities that jean vanier founded like ,COMMA jean .PERIOD vanier himself ,COMMA exude tenderness ,COMMA 
And compassion can also have those qualities 
And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories ,COMMA never by statistics and strategies 
Rachel naomi remen says ,COMMA this is an important and empowering story for our time ,COMMA because this story insists that each and every one of us ,COMMA frail and flawed as we may be ,COMMA inadequate ,COMMA as we may feel has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch 
This is going to change science .PERIOD i believe ,COMMA and it will change religion 
Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions 
But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction ,COMMA in the early 20th century 
So in this photograph ,COMMA you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral -- it's not 
Thank you 
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol 
And it went like this r-o-w-d-i-e .PERIOD that's the way we spell .PERIOD rowdie 
And i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books 
And i was always going off to crowded bars .PERIOD when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends 
So even if you're an extrovert yourself ,COMMA i'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .PERIOD 
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .PERIOD 
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .PERIOD 
And also we have this belief system ,COMMA right now that i call the new groupthink ,COMMA which holds that all creativity ,COMMA and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place 
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert .PERIOD even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable .PERIOD according to research 
Now ,COMMA i think ,COMMA at this point it's important for me to say that i actually love .PERIOD extroverts 
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops ,COMMA also teach us love and trust 
Here's margaret atwood cat's eye 
But here's the thing about my grandfather 
It was my version of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library ,COMMA 
And i call this my year of speaking dangerously 
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work 
We need to be teaching kids to work together for sure ,COMMA but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own 
And that's okay .PERIOD 
Then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 ,COMMA 
He explained to me about johann strauss and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world .PERIOD 
That's year by year ,COMMA this comes from our friends at gapmindercom 
So we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down 
And frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this ,COMMA but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it ,COMMA it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they're all highly commoditized .PERIOD but they're all different 
And the last piece ,COMMA which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many .PERIOD this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local ,COMMA integrated ,COMMA end-to-end ecosystems 
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa in a school that's called nelson mandela school .PERIOD and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers ,COMMA it's just phenomenal 
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this ,COMMA and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting ,COMMA exciting activity 
I'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems 
I was eager to go off to college and go find girls and study and girls and study .PERIOD but then i finished college ,COMMA and i fell in love 
And on my wedding day ,COMMA my father came to me again and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm going to remind you again that each generation has to do better than the last one 
Just existing 
I really think that's there's this inner desire .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention 
That's kind of a no-brainer 
So what is it for 
So i believe essentially ,COMMA that leadership is stewardship .PERIOD 
This is not my planet .PERIOD it wasn't mine before i was born .PERIOD 
Do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment .PERIOD seriously ,COMMA 
What we believe obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior ,COMMA and our behavior determines what we become in life ,COMMA 
My wife ,COMMA and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money 
We just said ,COMMA we're not going to use it on us 
Believe me ,COMMA there's a whole lot easier ways to make money 
The last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers 
And that is when my wife and i got married 30 years ago ,COMMA we started tithing 
Materialism ,COMMA is all about getting -- get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest 
And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good ,COMMA feeling ,COMMA good and having the goods 
There's a chapter in the bible called psalm 72 ,COMMA and it's solomon's prayer for more influence 
Basically he's talking about all the marginalized in society .PERIOD 
It's a shepherd's staff ,COMMA 
And by the way ,COMMA my god doesn't have to show up on cheese bread 
You know ,COMMA if god's going to show up he's not going to show up on cheese bread 
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off 
What do you do with a shepherd's staff ?QUESTIONMARK 
You pull them ,COMMA or you poke them one or the other 
And it represents your influence 
And that gives with you enormous influence 
What are you doing with what you've been given 
Why would god wire you to do something ?QUESTIONMARK and then not have you do it 
And in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school 
So in the three years since i talked at ted and showed a prototype ,COMMA it's gone from an idea to a real laptop 
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children .PERIOD and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment 
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .PERIOD 
They own the laptops ,COMMA they take them home 
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write 
So it's 1995 ,COMMA i'm in college and a friend ,COMMA and i go on a road trip from providence ,COMMA rhode island to portland .PERIOD oregon .PERIOD 
We get it in the abstract 
But the thing is ,COMMA the coyote runs off the cliff ,COMMA right after him .PERIOD 
That's when he falls ,COMMA 
This is not mine by the way 
We learn these really bad lessons really well ,COMMA 
When the vice president for health care quality at beth israel spoke about this incident .PERIOD he said something very interesting 
And yeah ,COMMA it is also why we get things wrong .PERIOD 
I just imagined it everywhere ,COMMA which has happened 
And the crypto-theme is ,COMMA 'i thought this one thing was going to happen ,COMMA and something else happened instead' .PERIOD and the thing is says ,COMMA ira glass .PERIOD we need this 
But you know ,COMMA our stories are like this ,COMMA because our lives are like this 
And something else happened instead ,COMMA 
Because half the stuff that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- ted 1998 -- eh ,COMMA 
We come up with another idea 
Bioenergy isn't global warming .PERIOD bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive .PERIOD bioenergy is oil .PERIOD it's gas .PERIOD it's coal ,COMMA and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way ,COMMA or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves ,COMMA or stuff ,COMMA is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it .PERIOD and to do that ,COMMA you really have to look first at agriculture .PERIOD 
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas ,COMMA the types of wells that you're beginning to see .PERIOD don't look ,COMMA unlike those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots 
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff .PERIOD but as you think of coal ,COMMA this is what burned wheat kernels look like not entirely unlike coal .PERIOD 
That is what bioenergy is .PERIOD it is not ethanol .PERIOD it is not subsidies to a few companies .PERIOD it is not importing corn into iowa ,COMMA because you've built .PERIOD so many of these ethanol plants ,COMMA it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture ,COMMA from brute force into biological force .PERIOD and in the measure that you can do that ,COMMA you can clean some stuff ,COMMA and you can clean it pretty quickly .PERIOD 
But in the meantime ,COMMA for the next decade ,COMMA at least ,COMMA the name of the game is hydrocarbons and be that oil be that gas be that coal .PERIOD this is what we're dealing with .PERIOD and before i make this talk too long .PERIOD here's what's happening in the current energy system .PERIOD 
86 percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons ,COMMA that means 86 percent of the stuff we're consuming are probably processed plants and amoebas and the rest of the stuff .PERIOD and there's a role in here for conservation .PERIOD there's a role in here for alternative stuff .PERIOD but we've also got to get that other portion ,COMMA right 
And what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home .PERIOD 
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11 san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels .PERIOD 
And i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution 
Each of us ,COMMA no matter what our role is in business has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace ,COMMA 
So as i started reading more maslow ,COMMA what i started to realize is that maslow later in his life wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and specifically to business ,COMMA 
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees ,COMMA and our customers ,COMMA i realized we had no metrics 
So i went out and studied a bunch of things .PERIOD and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide ,COMMA believe that the intangibles are important in their business ,COMMA things ,COMMA like intellectual property ,COMMA their corporate culture ,COMMA their brand loyalty .PERIOD and yet only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business ,COMMA 
And he's a very wise man .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA listen .PERIOD bhutan's goal is not to create happiness 
One of those key indicators is how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day 
Or in other words ,COMMA i think .PERIOD the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have -- imagine gratitude -- divided by having what you want -- gratification 
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting .PERIOD 
As you look at these two columns here ,COMMA doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count a new way to imagine what's important to us in life 
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census 
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity 
They're about demographics 
Abe maslow ,COMMA said ,COMMA long ago ,COMMA something you've heard before ,COMMA but you didn't realize it was him 
He said ,COMMA if the only tool you have is a hammer ,COMMA everything starts to look like a nail 
In vivian's case .PERIOD her unit of production isn't the tangible hours .PERIOD she works .PERIOD it's the intangible difference .PERIOD she makes during that one hour of work 
He stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years ,COMMA and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him 
We don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits ,COMMA we can have both 
At least ,COMMA as he wrote when a robot dies ,COMMA you don't have to write a letter to its mother .PERIOD 
The us is currently ahead in military robotics right now .PERIOD but we know that in technology ,COMMA there's no such thing as a permanent .PERIOD first move or advantage .PERIOD 
There's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq ,COMMA while sitting at your home computer 
Soldiers have a name for these clips 
The typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits bodies ,COMMA burst into the air .PERIOD with the explosion 
It was set to music 
And so we kind of have this kind of moral feel-good moment 
That bottle winds up getting burned 
And so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley ,COMMA poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately ,COMMA and then poor people who even at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened ,COMMA are all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability 
Now you think to yourself -- because i know how you are -- you say that sure is terrible for those poor people 
It's just awful .PERIOD those poor people 
I hope someone does something to help them 
But guess what 
We don't have disposable resources 
And as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding ,COMMA new opportunities for action begin to emerge .PERIOD 
But if we want to make something hard ,COMMA we come up ,COMMA i know i'm going to make a hard substance 
We just had this vote ,COMMA and everybody's like well ,COMMA not in our state .PERIOD 
Just so proud 
But california ,COMMA though we lead the world in some of the green stuff .PERIOD we also ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA lead the world in some of the gulag stuff .PERIOD 
We have a moral challenge in this moment 
And really they fundamentally told you are you going to hug a tree ,COMMA or are you going to hug a child ?QUESTIONMARK pick 
Well ,COMMA when you start working on issues like plastic ,COMMA you realize that the whole thing is connected .PERIOD and luckily ,COMMA most of us are blessed to have two arms 
They'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window ,COMMA and well they were easy to capture 
I've called this vehicle ,COMMA generically ,COMMA a volantor after the latin word ,COMMA volant ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA to fly in a light ,COMMA nimble manner .PERIOD 
Volantor-like helicopter perhaps 
The press calls my particular volantor a skycar 
One could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does ,COMMA and gets around in much the same way ,COMMA and it's true .PERIOD but a helicopter is a very complex device 
Because if you're in this world ,COMMA where computers are controlling what you're doing ,COMMA it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you 
Well ,COMMA you can't right now take off from your home ,COMMA because it's too noisy 
I mean ,COMMA to be able to take off from your home ,COMMA you'd have to be extremely quiet .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA if you can fly like that ,COMMA why are you going to drive around on a highway 
You can play computer games ,COMMA you can sleep .PERIOD you can read on the way 
And then through the various years ,COMMA we invented various vehicles 
Redundancy is the critical issue here .PERIOD 
If you want to stay alive ,COMMA you've got to have backups .PERIOD 
That's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco 
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell .PERIOD 
There's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it's msnbc -- in which they asked the question ,COMMA are you in the market for a volantor 
I mean think about how much we love this 
Think about that 
What dr .PERIOD soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers ,COMMA using this technology ,COMMA which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room 
And what i'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here 
And if the demo gods are willing in about 10 seconds ,COMMA or so we should see it 
Think about it ,COMMA you don't want those ugly cords coming down 
Imagine if you can get rid of it ,COMMA 
And i'll do it again ,COMMA just for safety's sake .PERIOD 
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing 
It runs the android operating system .PERIOD 
So we put a little sleeve on the back ,COMMA but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .PERIOD 
And think of what that would do for you 
And third ,COMMA our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .PERIOD 
If you're cremated ,COMMA all those toxins ,COMMA i mentioned are released into the atmosphere .PERIOD 
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies ,COMMA we deny death ,COMMA poison the living and further harm .PERIOD the environment 
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to ,COMMA have with our food 
The decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death ,COMMA denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture ,COMMA a radical acceptance of death and decomposition 
So the virtual earth initiative and other types of these initiatives are all about extending our current search metaphor .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the virtual earth team 
When we think about how all this comes together .PERIOD it's all about software algorithms and math 
We do this all through software algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities .PERIOD 
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-d model ,COMMA 
I'm going to use these two countries to make an economic argument for democracy ,COMMA rather than against democracy 
Look at the skyline of shanghai ,COMMA 
The picture on india is the dharavi slum of mumbai in india ,COMMA 
In an interview printed in the financial press of india ,COMMA he said that he wants to make mumbai another shanghai 
This is an oxford-trained economist steeped in humanistic values .PERIOD and yet he agrees with the high-pressure tactics of shanghai 
This is a very little known fact about the two countries 
The economy grows ,COMMA government accumulates more resources ,COMMA and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .PERIOD 
One reason is the east asian model 
Korea succeeded .PERIOD north korea .PERIOD didn't 
Burma didn't succeed 
In china ,COMMA it's all women 
By looking at these two pictures ,COMMA i say ,COMMA no ,COMMA it won't overtake china for a while ,COMMA 
Actually the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that ,COMMA 
Indira gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975 
Why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster .PERIOD 
But china is a superstar in terms of economic growth ,COMMA 
This is the grand cafe here in oxford 
That's its great claim to fame .PERIOD and i wanted to show it to you not because i want to give you the kind of starbucks tour of historic england ,COMMA but rather because the english coffeehouse was crucial to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years ,COMMA what we now call the enlightenment .PERIOD 
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation ,COMMA unusual levels of creativity 
And this is what they ended up coming with 
It's called a neonurture device 
In the inside ,COMMA it's all car parts 
It's got a fan ,COMMA it's got headlights for warmth ;SEMICOLON it's got door chimes for alarm -- it runs off a car battery 
This is hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern ,COMMA but this is what the coffee shops looked like back .PERIOD then 
And one of the problems with this is that people are actually -- when you research this field -- people are notoriously unreliable ,COMMA when they actually kind of self-report on where they have their own good ideas ,COMMA or their history of their best ideas 
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope ,COMMA when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler ,COMMA and all these things 
But that's a key thing 
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues ,COMMA and everybody's like ,COMMA no ,COMMA i hadn't thought of doing that 
And so guier and weiffenbach ,COMMA go back to weiffenbach's office ,COMMA and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking ,COMMA as we might call it .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
We should record it 
And they thought about it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess maybe you could ?QUESTIONMARK let's run the numbers here 
And i bet you one of you ,COMMA if not more has used said device and said ,COMMA satellite system to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last -- in the last day or last week ,COMMA right 
Chance favors the connected mind 
My story starts way before i was born 
They got on and didn't know where they were going ,COMMA and ended up in canada 
I was 14 ,COMMA and i emailed professors at the local university to see ,COMMA if maybe i could go work in their lab ,COMMA and hardly anyone responded 
And so i thought ,COMMA maybe if it can promote cell growth ,COMMA it can inhibit cell death too ,COMMA 
And so that's the project that i pursued for that year ,COMMA and it's continuing now as well and found that a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent 
But i'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time .PERIOD so how did the good and bad go together ?QUESTIONMARK 
And while i was doing this ,COMMA i was reading the cancer literature ,COMMA trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field 
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture ,COMMA and then bone cancer arises .PERIOD 
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated 
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation ,COMMA we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation ,COMMA trying to kill it .PERIOD 
We're removing the cancer cells ,COMMA but we're revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix 
So this really changed my view of looking at cancer 
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ .PERIOD that's what a metastasis is 
But then again ,COMMA this fact that the metastases didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely 
And i guess i'll keep investigating until i get the answers 
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply it needs to be constantly contracting .PERIOD so therefore it's almost selfish ,COMMA it's grabbing its blood vessels for itself .PERIOD 
And i hate to say that ,COMMA but it seems as though muscle cell possibly because of all ,COMMA its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury to fine-tune this repair response .PERIOD and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish .PERIOD i really believe that the human body is very ,COMMA very smart ,COMMA and we can't counteract something .PERIOD the body is saying to do 
And again ,COMMA some of these may be far-fetched ,COMMA but i figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas ,COMMA it's here at ted .PERIOD so ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD 
Some of you have heard the story before ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA there's somebody in the audience who's never heard this story -- in front of an audience -- before ,COMMA so i'm a little more nervous than i normally am telling this story 
And then my translator left 
They slept on the floor at night 
I had photographed as i said ,COMMA a lot of these kids 
Again ,COMMA not at all shy or withdrawn ,COMMA or anything ,COMMA like the other children that i'd photographed 
It was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader 
And i said to my translator ,COMMA what's going on ,COMMA why is she crying 
And i said ,COMMA i'm 28 years old ,COMMA and i live in hotels ,COMMA and i'm not married 
And they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me 
So i finally found myung sung ,COMMA her best friend that she used to play with after school ,COMMA every day 
And i said to the translator ,COMMA what did he say 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA tell him that i am a photographer 
I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful ,COMMA bright happy little child ,COMMA who now appeared to be very withdrawn ,COMMA being enslaved by this family ,COMMA 
So i finally decided ,COMMA i said ,COMMA look -- this is all through the translator ,COMMA because this is all ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't speak a word of korean -- and i said ,COMMA look ,COMMA i'm really glad that hyun-sook has a family to live with 
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here 
Well ,COMMA there was an american marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house 
He had kids from all over korea ,COMMA living there ,COMMA and he would find families for these kids 
Hyun-sook stayed at father keene's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through 
And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day 
We went back to our hotel room ,COMMA and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was 
And we fall asleep -- and i've been in this room ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for a couple of months .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
And they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day ,COMMA i always left the window open 
And i don't speak korean ,COMMA but i'm hearing these voices .PERIOD and i'm not hearing anger .PERIOD i'm hearing terror 
I remember his son had the ll bean bootlaces ,COMMA and we're trying to do up his laces 
So we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces ,COMMA and the kids faces 
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire 
Five people jumped and died .PERIOD other people were killed by the smoke .PERIOD 
So it turned into a dual celebration ,COMMA because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united states 
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage ,COMMA 
And the pilot ,COMMA jeff cowley actually went back and adopted .PERIOD one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting natasha 
So at this point ,COMMA natasha doesn't speak a word of english other than what little father keene taught her 
She learned english in three months 
Natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her ,COMMA and she wouldn't answer ,COMMA and they didn't realize she didn't actually speak english very well .PERIOD in the beginning 
Now ,COMMA remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning ,COMMA 
The captain of the cheerleaders 
This is her half-sister 
Natasha would you just come up for a second ,COMMA just maybe to say hello to everybody 
Natasha i've seen pictures millions of times ,COMMA but today was the first time i'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation 
I started crying 
The telescope is actually built .PERIOD similarly ,COMMA to the well-known to you hubble space telescope ,COMMA except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens ,COMMA as you would call it as a photographer .PERIOD 
The way we do that actually is with a method ,COMMA which we call the transit method 
But we learn a lot from that not only that there is a planet there ,COMMA but we also learn its size .PERIOD 
So what have we learned 
And we do care about planets like the earth .PERIOD because by now we understood that life as a chemical system really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks ,COMMA and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate ,COMMA to emerge ,COMMA to survive ,COMMA 
So today ,COMMA i'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope ,COMMA kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks ,COMMA and lo and behold ,COMMA we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus 
It's about 100 million ,COMMA such planets 
So that's great ,COMMA because then we can go and study them -- remotely ,COMMA of course -- with all the techniques that we already have tested in the past five years 
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next 
So the question is ,COMMA is that chemical phenomenon universal ,COMMA or is it something which depends on the planet ?QUESTIONMARK 
We don't want to go blind ,COMMA because there's too many possibilities .PERIOD and there is not too much lab .PERIOD and there is not enough human time to actually to do all the experiments .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there are many reasons ,COMMA and you heard some of them in the short talk today ,COMMA 
And that is going to change our worldview in a profound way -- not in a dissimilar way as 400 years ago ,COMMA copernicus' act did by changing the way we view space and time 
And half the time ,COMMA what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK is it's related .PERIOD this kind of sense of insignificance to humankind to the earth in a bigger space .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA look ,COMMA you can see the necktie ,COMMA but you can't even imagine seeing the size of a little ,COMMA small atom .PERIOD 
So what does this tell us 
There is immense powerful potential in life in this universe -- especially now that we know that places like the earth are common 
Let's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one with synthetic biology ,COMMA being the way to transform both our environment and our future .PERIOD 
These gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world ,COMMA or how we estimate that it was 
Look india got many infected ,COMMA but had a low level 
And almost the same happens here 
Now ,COMMA let me make a fast replay of botswana ,COMMA 
And if people who are infected are treated ,COMMA they don't die of aids 
In spite of pepfar ,COMMA the generous pepfar ,COMMA all people are not reached by treatment .PERIOD and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries ,COMMA only 60 percent are left on treatment .PERIOD after two years ,COMMA 
No ,COMMA it's not look here .PERIOD 
There's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that's not the case .PERIOD 
See the difference within one african country -- it goes from very low level to very high level .PERIOD and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest .PERIOD 
So what is it ?QUESTIONMARK then 
It could be concurrency .PERIOD 
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years ,COMMA 
Let's talk about past and future ,COMMA billions 
We know that most of that wealth was made after the year .PERIOD 1800 
And notice ,COMMA most of that went to the motherland ,COMMA to the imperial metropoles ,COMMA not to their colonial possessions 
So i'm going to translate this into language that you can understand 
Let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this .PERIOD synthesizing the work of many economic historians in the process 
That really was a killer application 
Property rights ,COMMA it's not the democracy ,COMMA folks .PERIOD it's having the rule of law based on private property rights 
Very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi's road .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA the work ethic 
He was wrong 
Take a look at mathematical attainment ,COMMA by 15 year-olds ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA it's just five times ,COMMA and soon it will be 25 times 
And could africa get that sequencing wrong 
One obvious implication of modern economic history is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy .PERIOD before you've established secure private property rights 
Warning that may not work 
That's the basis for the western model of representative .PERIOD government 
And i think these words really nail it .PERIOD it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians .PERIOD 
That's not the way history works 
That's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations ,COMMA 
What's your view on that 
Niall ferguson ,COMMA well ,COMMA i really am not just talking about the rise of the east .PERIOD i'm talking about the rise of the rest .PERIOD and that includes south america 
I once asked one of my colleagues at harvard ,COMMA hey ,COMMA is south america part of the west 
Spiders are not just everywhere ,COMMA but they're extremely diverse .PERIOD 
Spiders are also extremely old .PERIOD 
Even fossil spiders can make silk ,COMMA as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider 
So this means that both spiders and spider silk have been around for 380 million years 
You can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets ,COMMA because each spinneret has many spigots on it 
In an orb-web-weaving spider ,COMMA you can find seven types of silk glands .PERIOD and what i have depicted here in this picture ,COMMA let's start at the one o'clock position ,COMMA there's tubuliform silk glands ,COMMA which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .PERIOD 
So silk fibers vary in their strength .PERIOD and also their extensibility 
If it wasn't able to stretch so much ,COMMA then basically ,COMMA when an insect hit the web ,COMMA it would just trampoline right off of it .PERIOD 
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders 
How do groups get anything done right ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value ,COMMA instead of just being chaos 
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output ,COMMA 
More recently ,COMMA because the cost of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor -- and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer ,COMMA which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system without regard to institutional models .PERIOD 
And what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself ,COMMA charming though it is ,COMMA but rather to these photos 
First of all ,COMMA when you form an institution ,COMMA you take on a management problem ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
You have to have legal structure 
Third forming an institution is inherently exclusionary .PERIOD 
You can't hire everyone in a company ,COMMA right 
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure ,COMMA which is the flickr answer ,COMMA you can leave the people where they are .PERIOD and you take the problem to the individuals ,COMMA rather than moving the individuals to the problem 
In bigger systems ,COMMA the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer .PERIOD so the imbalance increases 
If you go down to five percent ,COMMA you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos 
We've looked at who's contributed to linux ,COMMA and most of the patches have been produced by programmers who've only done one thing ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
Do you want that patch ,COMMA right 
Meetup a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub ,COMMA or what have you 
Stay-at-home moms right 
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free 
And the answer to that question is ,COMMA it doesn't matter because that's not the right question .PERIOD 
And if there is an answer to that ,COMMA that happens outside the professional framework of journalism ,COMMA it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class 
They trade tips like if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box .PERIOD the feeling will pass 
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial 
Now ,COMMA when the larger group is a bunch of drunks ,COMMA and the small group wants to stay sober ,COMMA then we think that's a great support group .PERIOD 
But when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice ,COMMA then we're horrified 
Flavor is king flavor .PERIOD rules .PERIOD 
So this is the challenge for this bread 
And this is what every student has to begin with 
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is mise en place ,COMMA which is just a french way of saying ,COMMA get organized 
Everything in its place first stage ,COMMA 
Stage ?QUESTIONMARK two is mixing .PERIOD we take the ingredients ,COMMA and we mix them 
And so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten ,COMMA we have to activate the leaven or the yeast ,COMMA and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly 
And at stage nine ,COMMA we get the dough to the final shape ,COMMA and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 
And the starches ,COMMA when they reach about 180 degrees ,COMMA gelatinize 
And stage 11 ,COMMA we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread ,COMMA right away 
And we save some of those for the next generation 
So we turn it into flour ,COMMA 
Not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot ,COMMA but water boiled off and becoming steam 
So we've got now this flour 
And what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK we add some water 
Or another analogy would be ,COMMA a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly 
But we've got this bread .PERIOD and what i did here is to try to ,COMMA again ,COMMA evoke even more flavor from this grain was we've added into it .PERIOD the spent grain from beer-making 
And so this is again ,COMMA hopefully not only a healthy bread .PERIOD but a bread that you will enjoy 
So if i kind of break this bread ,COMMA maybe we can share this now a little bit here 
We'll start a little piece here .PERIOD and i'm going to take a little piece here -- i think i'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch .PERIOD 
Let me give you just one example of this 
Now the question is :COLON how could we ask them 
But half the time ,COMMA what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go .PERIOD mmmmm :COLON broccoli :COLON 
So she'd act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted 
The question you might ask ,COMMA though ,COMMA is why do children learn so much 
Well ,COMMA what kind of explanation could we have for this 
And essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize describe the way that scientists find out about the world 
And some 10 years ago ,COMMA i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .PERIOD 
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector ,COMMA something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with the detector will actually activate two out of three times 
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this 
The first one is again ,COMMA remember these are four year-olds 
They're just learning how to count 
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around ,COMMA is really a kind of experimental research program 
I don't know 
Not working either 
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .PERIOD 
It's good to be a grownup 
That technology is simulating humans 
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game 
I've made him run into a wall here over and over again ,COMMA 
So we simulated that as well ,COMMA and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network ,COMMA how to walk 
We heard about those already yesterday ,COMMA and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already 
Those are then selected by the algorithm ,COMMA reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this might look kind of trivial ,COMMA but it's actually very important ,COMMA because this is not something you get at the moment ,COMMA in any interactive ,COMMA or any virtual worlds 
So that's what you see here 
We just took this character that i just talked about ,COMMA put it on a slippery surface .PERIOD and this is what you get out of it .PERIOD 
So that you don't have a character that looks limp ,COMMA but actually a character that you can use in an action film ,COMMA straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well .PERIOD 
That's one angle .PERIOD here's another angle .PERIOD 
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw ,COMMA but in a slightly better ,COMMA rendered version 
This is incredibly quick .PERIOD this is happening in real time .PERIOD 
This is another behavior they requested 
You feel kind of sorry for the guy 
It's even worse -- and that is another video ,COMMA i just got last night -- if you render that a bit ,COMMA more realistically ,COMMA 
Yes ,COMMA you can just about see it here 
Now we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves ,COMMA can we do that ourselves as well .PERIOD 
This was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved ,COMMA i should say -- to produce balance ,COMMA basically ,COMMA 
So that all happened automatically ,COMMA we didn't put that in there ,COMMA 
Thanks 
You can draw as everyone should 
Shake it and you have a heterosexual couple 
You know ,COMMA i'm making a very important argument 
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .PERIOD 
Say your motorcycle crashes 
Ok ,COMMA when i was offered the times column ,COMMA six years ago ,COMMA the deal was like this .PERIOD you'll be sent the coolest ,COMMA hottest ,COMMA slickest new gadgets 
Every week ,COMMA it'll arrive at your door 
The job though came with one small downside ,COMMA and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column 
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to 
Some of the stories are just so classic ,COMMA and yet so understandable ,COMMA 
And the technician's like ma'am ,COMMA you've got the mouse up against the screen 
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices ,COMMA where there are so many features and options ,COMMA you have to do two dimensions .PERIOD you know ,COMMA a vertical and a horizontal ,COMMA you guys all complained about .PERIOD how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically 
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse ,COMMA the choices 
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross .PERIOD so what is the answer 
I'm sorry ,COMMA it's not one yet 
You have to scroll ,COMMA like ,COMMA seven screens-full to get to it 
It's like a 747 shuttle ,COMMA cockpit ,COMMA 
You do not 
We've entered planet domination mode .PERIOD 
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh ,COMMA but they can't they're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .PERIOD 
I liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot .PERIOD watch 
The lesson was simplicity sells 
Here's another example ,COMMA chris .PERIOD you're the source of all power 
In my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software .PERIOD and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous 
I also use this feature called voice macros period .PERIOD 
Correct dissuade not just 
No new features ,COMMA it's never happened before in software .PERIOD 
It could be the design of the thing you're using 
But i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse .PERIOD 
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing ,COMMA because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage ,COMMA causes a trillion dollar response ,COMMA which is largely ineffective ,COMMA and arguably ,COMMA probably almost certainly has made the problem worse 
So after giving up on the book -- and i had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago and to work through venture capital on the innovative side ,COMMA and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems .PERIOD 
Things where you know a factor of 10 difference can make a factor of 1000 difference in the outcome .PERIOD 
The first is this whole area of education ,COMMA and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer ,COMMA 
I think the challenge for us is -- i'm very certain that that will happen .PERIOD the challenge is ,COMMA will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device 
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers ,COMMA but we don't have very good software for them 
So given that we know and should believe -- because moore's law's been like a constant ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it's just been very predictable progress ,COMMA over the last 40 years ,COMMA or whatever 
We have a challenge because the urban population is growing in this century ,COMMA from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time .PERIOD people are moving to the cities 
And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover ,COMMA as we start to engineer at the nano scale ,COMMA 
We believe that genentech ,COMMA the compaq the lotus the sun ,COMMA the netscape the amazon .PERIOD the google in these fields are yet to be found ,COMMA because this materials revolution will drive these things forward .PERIOD 
And to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $400 million fund ,COMMA so this for us is a very substantial fund ,COMMA 
And what we did over the last few months -- well ,COMMA a few months ago ,COMMA ray kurzweil .PERIOD and i wrote an op-ed in the new york times about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous .PERIOD 
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains 
We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps ,COMMA we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic 
So we're very excited ,COMMA because we think we can fund 10 or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this 
But above all ,COMMA what we have to do ,COMMA is we have to help the good guys ,COMMA the people on the defensive side .PERIOD have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things 
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them ,COMMA but nevertheless ,COMMA they're absolutely gripping ,COMMA and contain unbelievable biological wonders that are very ,COMMA very different from those that we have on the planet 
Apart from the intrinsic value of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there ,COMMA we're also using these as templates for figuring out how to go look for life on other planets .PERIOD 
Particularly mars ,COMMA but also europa ,COMMA the small ,COMMA icy moon around jupiter .PERIOD 
We're getting ready to begin to go through the process of leaving our planet of origin and out into the wider solar system and beyond 
I think myself that life is a natural outgrowth of the increasing complexification of matter over time .PERIOD 
It's going to be everywhere ,COMMA we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it 
So this is a very bold statement 
How do you know it when you find it 
Very critically ,COMMA how do we protect it ?QUESTIONMARK if we find it and not contaminate it 
If i were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a petri plate ,COMMA within about four or five hours ,COMMA i would have to see growth 
So they are intrinsically a slower life-form 
It's a very simple trick ,COMMA and i never fail to do it .PERIOD when i'm sitting in a window seat 
This is regularly ,COMMA several hundred parts per million 
And these are mineral deposits that are also made by bacteria .PERIOD 
And so one can send a thousand of them as you can see in this upper left-hand picture ,COMMA a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay that was used for one of the current mer rovers 
The question as to whether there is life on mars ,COMMA that is related to life on earth has now been very muddied ,COMMA because we now know from mars .PERIOD meteorites that have made it to earth that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets .PERIOD 
One of the burning questions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface ,COMMA as i fully expect that we will is that a second genesis of life 
Did it start there and get transported here 
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century ,COMMA and where i expect that we will have more and more mars missions to answer these questions ,COMMA 
For real -- you can take a second ,COMMA you've got to feel this to learn it 
Well ,COMMA you could resist the temptation to announce ,COMMA your goal ,COMMA 
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles .PERIOD he would not reveal exactly where the building was ,COMMA and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building 
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-fbi and ex-scotland yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this 
There are very few places in the us where you can try ,COMMA real kobe and one of them is wolfgang .PERIOD puck's restaurant ,COMMA cut in los angeles .PERIOD 
It was like 160 dollars for this 
And then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that you know ,COMMA their purpose had been served .PERIOD and so i'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me 
This is soap that's made from silver nanoparticles ,COMMA which have antibacterial properties .PERIOD 
And it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA tickled a little bit and it smelled good .PERIOD but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today ,COMMA 
These ones gq did spring for -- i own these -- but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you ?QUESTIONMARK i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that i have owned and worn these 
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans ,COMMA and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed ,COMMA form ,COMMA 
But anyway ,COMMA we had a great night's sleep .PERIOD 
And you spend a third of your life in bed 
This is tom cruise arriving at the mission :COLON impossible iii ,COMMA premiere 
When he tries to open the door ,COMMA you could call it mission .PERIOD impossible :COLON iv :COLON 
There was one object that i could not get my hands on .PERIOD and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .PERIOD 
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .PERIOD 
Earlier this year ,COMMA a virtual asteroid in it sold for 330000 ,COMMA real dollars 
And this is a titan class ship in the space game ,COMMA eve ,COMMA online 
It gives you great powers 
Your ambition is satisfied .PERIOD but it's very beautiful 
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement 
But this isn't the really interesting stuff 
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it 
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes ,COMMA getting better and better stuff in them 
This sounds immensely boring ,COMMA but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling 
But we don't just have pies in the boxes .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a billion monsters 
They're not rational about probability 
It's not giving me my last two pies .PERIOD i'm going to give up 
And the point is really that we evolved to be satisfied by the world ,COMMA in particular ways ,COMMA 
So you give people lots and lots of different tasks ,COMMA 
Third ,COMMA you reward effort 
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen in places ,COMMA like the university of bristol in the uk ,COMMA where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain .PERIOD 
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent 
Let's start with business 
But each bag we'd sell would provide a year's worth of school meals for one kid 
All this time you're -- when you think about hunger ,COMMA it's a hard thing to think about ,COMMA because what we think about is eating 
There's definitely hunger in america .PERIOD 49 million people and almost 167 million children 
Hunger ,COMMA definitely means something a little bit different in america than it does internationally .PERIOD but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA they're both about food 
And you know ,COMMA the reality is that between farmers in america who actually ,COMMA quite frankly ,COMMA when i spend time in the midwest are pretty large in general ,COMMA 
So the problematic food system is affecting both hunger and obesity 
Not to beat a dead horse ,COMMA but this is a global food system where there's a billion people hungry and billion people obese 
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods 
Another thing that's become incredibly global ,COMMA is production of meat and fish 
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession .PERIOD 
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided ,COMMA but we would merely write it off as merely execution .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do ,COMMA like managing contracts ,COMMA learning how to write contracts ,COMMA understanding procurement processes ,COMMA understanding the time value of money and cost estimation .PERIOD 
Take joint positions with your client 
Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation 
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building 
The architectural manifestation was frankly ,COMMA just dumb 
In fact ,COMMA it really was the clients who had to do it 
They had to make a decision based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-a architecture and one-third infrastructure ,COMMA to actually the inverse .PERIOD two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-a architecture .PERIOD 
Now that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time ,COMMA 
But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences 
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake .PERIOD to allow that to happen .PERIOD 
There you see ,COMMA it's the side balconies for the proscenium .PERIOD 
Meaning nothing that we do ,COMMA can we be the first ones to do it 
Now if i'll take you through -- this is an early concept sketch -- take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together ,COMMA 
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber ,COMMA aida their elephants .PERIOD you can bring the elephants in 
Et ?QUESTIONMARK voila .PERIOD 
This is the at&ampt performing arts center's dee and charles wyly theater 
But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going ,COMMA what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with 
So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings ,COMMA i ever made 
I have many of these books ,COMMA and i've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years 
And i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life 
As opposed to knowing the whole story ,COMMA just knowing a little bit of the story ,COMMA and then letting your own mind fill in the rest 
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes ,COMMA searching for occurrences of the phrases i feel ,COMMA and i am feeling .PERIOD and when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .PERIOD 
And when that happens ,COMMA these montage compositions are automatically created ,COMMA which consist of the sentence and images being combined .PERIOD 
I'm 23 ,COMMA and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive .PERIOD 
I feel sassy 
As you can see ,COMMA we feel fine collects very ,COMMA very small-scale personal stories .PERIOD 
So really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story .PERIOD 
And the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here ,COMMA waits for a whale to come close enough to attack .PERIOD and when it does ,COMMA it throws a harpoon at it .PERIOD and then hauls the whale up under the ice ,COMMA and cuts it up 
They have colors ,COMMA what do they look like 
This is in the patkotak's family ,COMMA living room in their house in barrow ,COMMA the boxed wine ,COMMA they served us 
Cigarette break outside -- i don't smoke 
So you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon ,COMMA 
A 16-year-old student 
I asked her about that ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA she meant that she doesn't want to be married because in her opinion ,COMMA when you get married in bhutan ,COMMA as a woman ,COMMA your chances to live an independent life kind of end .PERIOD and so she had no interest in that 
A 37-year-old road worker 
His wish was to make some money and open a store 
Finally ,COMMA this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to 
I asked her a little bit more about the cave ,COMMA and what she planned would happen once she went there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
Jonathan harris ,COMMA maybe you'll die .PERIOD woman :COLON yes ,COMMA 
Yeah ,COMMA but -- yeah ,COMMA ok ,COMMA do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years or to live for one year 
Woman ,COMMA yes ,COMMA from then i'm going to the heaven 
You can start to see some familiar balloons here 
Thank you 
So the approach that we took was the other way around 
What you see here is a prototypic device .PERIOD 
It's made of paper and paper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA wicks fluid ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA paper cloth -- drop wine on the tablecloth .PERIOD and the wine wicks all over everything 
So the production capability is there 
And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper 
You can't manipulate it very well ,COMMA although i'll show something about that in a moment ,COMMA 
So you take the drop of blood ,COMMA no further manipulations ,COMMA you put it on a little device ,COMMA the device filters out the blood cells ,COMMA lets the serum go through .PERIOD and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there 
Turns out to work actually quite well ,COMMA particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work 
I don't know whether the idea of one computer .PERIOD one child makes any sense .PERIOD here's the computer of the future .PERIOD because this screen is already there ,COMMA and they're ubiquitous 
The answer is that what you do ,COMMA and the details are not terribly important here is to make something more elaborate .PERIOD you take several different layers of paper .PERIOD each one containing its own little fluid system ,COMMA and you separate them by pieces of ,COMMA literally ,COMMA double-sided carpet tape .PERIOD the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .PERIOD 
But that is ,COMMA in principle ,COMMA the way you solve the fever of unexplained origin problem .PERIOD because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease .PERIOD and this will work in due course ,COMMA 
Now i have one last two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business 
We were very proud of this ,COMMA particularly the title ,COMMA which was eggbeater ,COMMA as centrifuge ,COMMA 
We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity ,COMMA 
Why are we spending $135 billion 
In the fourth act ,COMMA with our hubris ,COMMA our overconfidence developing .PERIOD we invaded iraq and afghanistan .PERIOD and in the fifth act ,COMMA we plunged into a humiliating mess 
When i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 2001-2002 ,COMMA what i saw was scenes like this 
In sangin where i was sick in 2002 ,COMMA the nearest health clinic was within three days walk 
And the same is true for the troops ,COMMA 
And the reason i'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened .PERIOD and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house ,COMMA why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me 
Now ,COMMA this is not to say ,COMMA afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa ,COMMA 
I ran a center at harvard from 2008 to 2010 .PERIOD and there were people like michael semple ,COMMA there who speak afghan languages fluently ,COMMA who've traveled to almost every district in the country 
You feel deep deep guilt 
The average british soldier is on a tour of only six months ,COMMA italian soldiers ,COMMA on tours of four months ,COMMA the american military on tours of 12 months .PERIOD 
So we need to change that institutional culture 
Secondly ,COMMA we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals 
Borders between the bosniak territory and the bosnian-serb territory have calmed down 
If what we're interested in is regional stability ,COMMA egypt is far more important .PERIOD 
Just briefly ,COMMA what's your take on the current events there and the intervention 
What we should have done ,COMMA in libya is we should have stuck to the un resolution .PERIOD 
For the first time in the united states ,COMMA a predominantly white group of voters voted for an african-american candidate for president 
But really the question here -- obama did relatively well ,COMMA in kansas ,COMMA 
Actually we didn't ask them ,COMMA but when they conducted exit polls in every state in 37 states out of the 50 they asked a question that was pretty direct about race .PERIOD 
And they ask a series of really interesting questions 
But you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are 
And likewise ,COMMA they asked not in 2000 .PERIOD but in the same survey in 1996 ,COMMA would you not vote for a qualified black president 
I'm a big fan of cities ,COMMA 
And it was followed a year or two later by laennec ,COMMA discovering the stethoscope 
It's been on calendars ,COMMA postage stamps in many different countries .PERIOD 
I call it the ipatient 
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level ,COMMA they had no need to touch her breasts .PERIOD 
But to her ,COMMA it mattered deeply 
We marry ,COMMA for example ,COMMA with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss .PERIOD 
I would feel the abdomen 
I remember so many huge ,COMMA hollowed out ,COMMA haunted eyes staring up at me as i performed .PERIOD this ritual 
It was an offering an invitation 
It's the -- it's produced by the quadro corporation of west virginia .PERIOD 
You could dowse for all sorts of things ,COMMA but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers 
So the way it works ,COMMA is you go down the hallway ,COMMA and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker .PERIOD and then you open the locker 
No it -- well ,COMMA it has kind of a right-leaning bias 
You can say a miracle occurs 
Whereas -- and it's true scientists ,COMMA sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter ,COMMA or something like that -- until we figure out what it is ,COMMA we'll just call it this -- it's the beginning of the causal chain for science 
You don't even need photoshop .PERIOD you don't need high-tech equipment .PERIOD you don't need computers .PERIOD 
In the case of galileo ,COMMA he had two problems when he turned his telescope to saturn ,COMMA 
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw 
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data ,COMMA you can't have a good theory .PERIOD 
And it wasn't solved until 1655 
And so you're reducing the quality of your data 
Virgin mary in clearwater florida ,COMMA 
Here's the virgin mary on the backside ,COMMA which they started to wipe off 
And in england ,COMMA there's a pop singer 
In america ,COMMA it would be .PERIOD we're 6000 light years from the edge .PERIOD 
And so if we can do that ,COMMA then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu .PERIOD thank you 
That is the primary function of an incubator 
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem 
He connected with people who cared about this .PERIOD nonprofessionals ,COMMA people with passion 
Henry ford comes up with a really cool idea .PERIOD 
It enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day .PERIOD 
And you can build an entire industry on that 
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating .PERIOD one 
So when al gore set out to change the world again ,COMMA he didn't do it by himself .PERIOD 
What kevin kelley has taught us is you just need .PERIOD i don't know a thousand true fans -- a thousand people who care enough that they will get .PERIOD you the next round ,COMMA and the next round ,COMMA and the next round ,COMMA 
The beatles did not invent teenagers 
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue .PERIOD 
I see what the status quo is ,COMMA i don't like it 
Someone stands up and says ,COMMA this one is important 
Because if you're not upsetting anyone you're not changing the status quo 
Because focusing on that part of it -- not the mechanics of what you're building ,COMMA but the who ,COMMA and the leading part -- is where change comes 
So here is what leaders have in common .PERIOD the first thing is ,COMMA they challenge the status quo 
The second thing is ,COMMA they build a culture 
Thank you very much .PERIOD i appreciate it 
They have different interests ;SEMICOLON they have divergent values .PERIOD 
They were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif :COLON al mutawa 
Now ,COMMA the 99 is not just a comic book 
It's now a theme park 
Now while 4shbab and the 99 may look new and shiny .PERIOD there is actually a very long tradition of this 
And to my mind ,COMMA those are pretty wise words ,COMMA no matter what your creed thank you .PERIOD 
This is tootsie's orchid lounge in nashville ,COMMA 
And the size of the room is not that big 
He wanted a bigger band 
The halls got bigger .PERIOD carnegie hall's fair-sized 
And they're a lot more reverberant than la scala ,COMMA 
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics ,COMMA which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music 
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .PERIOD 
And he's singing right into your ear .PERIOD 
He's whispering into your ears 
Now ,COMMA there's venues like this ,COMMA a discotheque .PERIOD and there's jukeboxes in bars ,COMMA where you don't even need to have a band 
And as with jazz ,COMMA the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .PERIOD 
So that doesn't really work 
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .PERIOD 
It's adaptive 
And i'm saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA the passion's still there ,COMMA but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into that is ,COMMA instinctively and intuitively created first 
We sing 
And like the birds ,COMMA the joy is still there ,COMMA even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .PERIOD 
As a clergyman ,COMMA you can imagine how out of place i feel 
And i was so stimulated 
But some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming down ,COMMA 
But i was on an airplane in the east some years ago and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte ,COMMA north carolina ,COMMA 
He said your sermons have certainly helped me 
But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution 
A man by the name of david came to the throne .PERIOD and king david became one of the great leaders of his generation 
He had the favor of god with him 
And david found that there were many problems that technology could not solve 
And yet ,COMMA he says he restores my soul 
We can't get along with other people ,COMMA even in our own families ,COMMA 
I'm going to harvard in about three or four -- no ,COMMA it's about two months from now -- to give a lecture 
What's life all about ,COMMA why am i here 
What shall i talk to her about 
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere ,COMMA i'm ad-libbing 
He said ,COMMA the lord is my shepherd 
And i said ,COMMA there's one thing that we have in common in this room ,COMMA all of us together whether republican or democrat ,COMMA or whoever 
As the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote ,COMMA he said ,COMMA there's every activity under heaven 
Was there a god 
The reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind 
And i said ,COMMA sir ,COMMA i do 
He said ,COMMA when i leave office ,COMMA i'm going to spend my time writing a book on why jesus christ rose again .PERIOD and why it's so important to believe that 
Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization .PERIOD 
Yet he too had to face death ,COMMA and he wrote these words ,COMMA even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ,COMMA i will fear no evil for you are with me 
When i was 17 years of age ,COMMA i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina ,COMMA 
I didn't make them in college until something happened in my heart 
He was a liar 
Or he was what he claimed to be 
Richard wurman :COLON you did it 
I know that beat 
Especially i will not die for you 
Everyone can be wrong 
I will not forget where i come from 
I will craft my own drum 
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance 
Your war drum ain't louder than this breath haaa .PERIOD 
What's up ted people ,COMMA let me hear you make some noise 
Hold her now with you 
Profits made prophets ignored 
Faced with absence .PERIOD 
After two weeks of working in that village ,COMMA it was time to go back 
With tears in my eyes ,COMMA i said ,COMMA no 
The women's chief of the village has this little girl fair color like me ,COMMA totally dirty .PERIOD 
I wish to go to school 
Several years ago ,COMMA a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation ,COMMA and the generation of young women 
Today we've worked with over 300 
This is the dream of the african girl 
But sadly ,COMMA the vision of a great future ,COMMA or the dream of a great future is just a dream ,COMMA because you have all of these vices 
This is a real rural village 
Now that was the advice that st .PERIOD benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .PERIOD 
Up until that moment ,COMMA i had been that classic corporate warrior -- i was eating too much .PERIOD i was drinking too much .PERIOD i was working too hard ,COMMA and i was neglecting the family 
Now ,COMMA the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in 
It's in their nature ,COMMA it's in their dna .PERIOD it's what they do -- even the good well-intentioned companies 
Have sex 
Now that can be daunting ,COMMA 
As i was walking out of his bedroom .PERIOD he said ,COMMA dad ,COMMA i went ,COMMA yes ,COMMA mate .PERIOD 
And the hunts point riverside park became the first waterfront .PERIOD park that the south bronx had had in more than 60 years 
And in the fall ,COMMA i'm actually going to -- i exchange marriage vows with my beloved .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD 
One out of four south bronx children has asthma 
Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed .PERIOD 
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the south bronx 
And luckily ,COMMA for me that home and the love inside of it ,COMMA along with help from teachers ,COMMA mentors and friends ,COMMA along the way was enough 
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided 
Once we realized that we decided it was time to do our own planning 
Anyway ,COMMA i know chris told us not to do pitches up here ,COMMA but since i have all of your attention ,COMMA we need investors end of pitch 
Anyway -- ok ,COMMA katrina prior to katrina ,COMMA the south bronx and new orleans' .PERIOD ninth ward had a lot in common both were largely populated by poor people of color ,COMMA both hotbeds of cultural innovation .PERIOD think hip-hop and jazz .PERIOD 
In the post-katrina era we have still more in common 
Neither the destruction of the ninth ward ,COMMA nor the south bronx was inevitable 
At present that's not happening in new york city .PERIOD 
And although less than 25 percent of south bronx residents own cars ,COMMA these projects include thousands of new parking spaces ,COMMA yet zip in terms of mass public transit 
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .PERIOD 
But one of the things i do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .PERIOD 
He looked at the demographics 
His administration narrowed key ,COMMA municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three ,COMMA outlawed parking on those streets ,COMMA expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes ,COMMA created public plazas ,COMMA created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .PERIOD 
I don't think he understood that i wasn't asking for funding 
This is more or less ,COMMA what we saw last year ,COMMA and this is how it will go on into the future .PERIOD 
Because you see ,COMMA now i presented statistics that don't exist 
And this is gdp per capita on this axis 
The last century 1870 was bad for the kids in europe .PERIOD because most of this statistics is europe 
And this is the united states moving away here ,COMMA earning more money 
Let us have a look at the united states .PERIOD 
Within some years ,COMMA chile may have better child survival than the united states 
That's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota 
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan 
Sweden was like ghana 
Because i have to show you one of the other facilities 
We can also make the color here represent the variable -- and what am i choosing here 
And there we are 2001 
The world is quite a messy place 
This is two to five dollars .PERIOD you have a bed 
I lectured on this for ikea ,COMMA and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here 
I would say that sub-saharan africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years ,COMMA 
And that's good .PERIOD it gets two plusses .PERIOD 
Environment is very ,COMMA very crucial 
Of course it's human rights .PERIOD 
And culture culture is the most important thing i would say ,COMMA because that's what brings joy to life 
Even african countries can achieve this 
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years ,COMMA has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious 
And so cars ,COMMA as art ,COMMA brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level ,COMMA you would with art with a capital a 
Now at this point you're going to see a picture of michelangelo 
Automobiles are self-moving things right elevators are automobiles 
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this 
Ok ,COMMA it's not marketing .PERIOD there's a very interesting car concept here .PERIOD but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .PERIOD 
It's that will to live that need to survive to express itself that comes in a car and takes over people like me 
And we tell other people do this do this do this until this thing comes alive ?QUESTIONMARK 
We are completely infected and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness .PERIOD it's quite wonderful 
Now now i get to the point i want to talk about cars as art 
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty 
And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence in why we're doing what we're doing 
Toothbrush cool 
I heard today about joseph's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction 
This is very difficult ,COMMA and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this because their life is wrapped up in that too 
This is 1996 we did this project .PERIOD and so we sent them off with this team name deep blue .PERIOD now ,COMMA many people know ,COMMA deep blue from ibm -- we actually stole it from them ,COMMA because we figured if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers 
And a group of engineers worked in germany ,COMMA and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what's the successor to the suv .PERIOD 
They would come together ,COMMA compare notes ,COMMA then they would work apart come together ,COMMA and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems 
The bathroom was so big ,COMMA she built the bed over the bathtub -- it's quite fascinating .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what i didn't know was ,COMMA and what we found out was -- these guys they can't even like ,COMMA talk to each other under those conditions 
There was a whole lot of dialog 
We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers 
Dialog kept on going with mental maps of words .PERIOD and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance ,COMMA i was seriously being baffled with bullshit .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings ,COMMA model concepts pictures -- everything i wanted .PERIOD they'd locked up in the cars because they had shown solidarity with the engineers -- and they'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start ,COMMA because they hadn't realized ,COMMA of course that they couldn't do problem creating 
It's true that the trust and the love that makes it worthwhile .PERIOD 
We didn't sequence his genome 
And the reason is that cancer like every cell in the body places ,COMMA little molecular bookmarks .PERIOD little post-it notes that remind the cell .PERIOD i'm cancer .PERIOD i should keep growing 
We just started mailing it to our friends .PERIOD 
And as we treat it with our compound ,COMMA this addiction to sugar ,COMMA this rapid growth ,COMMA faded 
And in fact ,COMMA this molecule prevents this adipocyte ,COMMA this fat stem cell ,COMMA from remembering how to make fat such that mice on a high fat diet ,COMMA like the folks in my hometown of chicago fail to develop fatty liver ,COMMA which is a major medical problem .PERIOD 
This molecule will soon leave our benches and go into a small startup company ,COMMA called tensha therapeutics 
I've never seen really anywhere this unique support for cancer research 
The age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years ,COMMA 
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity ,COMMA it would be moving away from you 
And if you look at a galaxy ,COMMA even farther away ,COMMA it would be moving away faster ,COMMA 
That kind of makes sense to us 
The air in this room is very smooth 
In particular things were a lot denser .PERIOD 
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies :COLON a hundred billion stars .PERIOD each 
We'd like to understand that 
One of the people who did understand that ,COMMA this was a problem was richard .PERIOD feynman 
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation ,COMMA to understanding 
It's not true that we've figured it out by now ,COMMA 
The reason the problem has gotten worse rather than better is because in 1998 ,COMMA we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before 
And so even though the universe will last forever ,COMMA and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away ,COMMA there will always be some radiation ,COMMA some thermal fluctuations ,COMMA even in empty space .PERIOD 
It will probably increase ,COMMA and the probability is enormously huge 
Remember life itself depends on the arrow of time .PERIOD 
Occasionally ,COMMA you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy ,COMMA or a hundred billion galaxies 
Now ,COMMA your homework assignment is to really think about this to contemplate what it means 
I just showed you this picture 
They all happen over a period of time ,COMMA equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years 
So here's two questions for you 
Maybe there is something that naturally through the growth of the laws of physics gives rise to universe ,COMMA like ours in low entropy configurations ,COMMA 
My bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .PERIOD 
And 50 years from now ,COMMA all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities 
This is a prediction .PERIOD i might be wrong 
I would like to share that story today ,COMMA 
Like everyone else ,COMMA we grew maize 
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school .PERIOD so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education 
So i went to a library 
So i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans and the poor who are struggling with your dreams 
God bless 
Unlike most of our computing devices ,COMMA these objects are much more fun to use 
A gesture of namaste ,COMMA maybe to respect someone ,COMMA or maybe -- in india ,COMMA i don't need to teach a kid that this means four runs in cricket .PERIOD 
So i was interested in these two rollers ,COMMA and i actually wanted more .PERIOD so i borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and i now had four rollers 
What i got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .PERIOD 
What we are interested in is information 
So i thought around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- i started thinking ,COMMA why can i not take this approach in the reverse way ?QUESTIONMARK 
But later ,COMMA i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels ,COMMA also ,COMMA 
You stop by a wall and start painting on that wall .PERIOD 
So technically ,COMMA it's a little bit complex ,COMMA but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use ,COMMA in some sense 
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket ,COMMA you can just do the gesture of taking a photo ,COMMA and it takes a photo for you 
Once it has that information ,COMMA it finds out more reviews about that ,COMMA or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that .PERIOD so you can actually hear on a physical book ,COMMA a review as sound 
So i was seeing the live [video] of his talk outside on just a newspaper 
So what i did here is remove the camera -- all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .PERIOD 
And i am a wilderness explorer in tribe .PERIOD 54) .PERIOD and you can ,COMMA of course ,COMMA play games 
Yeah ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA this looks nice .PERIOD let me print it out that thing 
Thank you 
This is incredible really 
And now if you see it's more about the cost-effectiveness .PERIOD this system costs you $300 compared to the $20000 surface tables or anything like that 
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time ,COMMA was costing around $5000 
No ,COMMA this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding ,COMMA and you know who i mean ,COMMA charles darwin 
Taste for both natural beauty ,COMMA and for the arts ,COMMA travel across cultures ,COMMA with great ease ,COMMA 
Now i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty with its emotional intensity and pleasure ,COMMA belongs to our evolved human psychology ,COMMA 
Now keeping these ideas firmly in mind ,COMMA we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination ,COMMA even obsession ,COMMA in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .PERIOD 
Beauty is nature's way of acting at a distance ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA 
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure ,COMMA the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes 
Their symmetry ,COMMA their attractive materials ,COMMA and above all ,COMMA their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes .PERIOD even today .PERIOD 
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence ,COMMA fine motor control ,COMMA planning ability .PERIOD conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials 
So before i talk about this car for the blind ,COMMA let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself 
So it's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes out .PERIOD so it can actually draw images 
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him ,COMMA 
So since we started this project ,COMMA we've been getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world .PERIOD 
But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology ,COMMA that can come from this project 
Why do we call it that 
I don't know taiwan straits .PERIOD 2025 
Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle .PERIOD space 
They said ,COMMA we couldn't do iraq 
You have to create internal partners ,COMMA you have to access coalition partners 
We asked the russians for 40000 
They said ,COMMA no 
Like saddam like mugabe like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions 
Like the 250000 dead so far in sudan 
And let's call this red line .PERIOD i don't know mission accomplished 
What we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force 
You've got to track coalition partners .PERIOD create a record of success ,COMMA 
So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language .PERIOD to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization 
We bought one military and we operated another 
I used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s ,COMMA 
Bad pentagon bad 
It elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy ,COMMA because that's how you're going to shrink that gap .PERIOD 
A department of war ,COMMA a department of everything else 
Our long-term rationale becomes .PERIOD we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets 
The question is :COLON how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world ,COMMA a lot more comfortable ,COMMA and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet 
Just be grateful robert reed ,COMMA didn't shove that bomb up his ass .PERIOD 
I love this force .PERIOD i don't want to see it go 
What does this mean in terms of operations 
The force on the right in and out 
The force on the right's going to obliterate it .PERIOD 
Different definitions of network centricity 
But ultimately ,COMMA you're going to civilianize it .PERIOD probably two thirds 
But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace .PERIOD 
The point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command 
See me now don't talk about it later ,COMMA 
The world is my playground 
I want the rules to be as loose as possible 
The town was burned down .PERIOD it was in the middle of winter ,COMMA and it was a very ,COMMA very severe winter .PERIOD 
And that's what we're going through at this time ,COMMA 
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology ,COMMA because i think i know very little about that -- i'm not a biologist -- so everything i know about it can be said in one minute 
But that's hard to do .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA the ice is thick 
But we can look outside very cheaply .PERIOD and in a simple fashion 
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy .PERIOD but it happened 
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin .PERIOD 
The sunlight in jupiter on the satellites of jupiter ,COMMA is 25 times fainter than it is here since jupiter is five times as far from the sun .PERIOD 
This was -- originally ,COMMA when radio astronomy began ,COMMA mr .PERIOD jansky at the bell labs detected ,COMMA radio waves ,COMMA coming from the sky 
Since there was nothing there you might as well ,COMMA not look 
There is something called pit lamping 
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .PERIOD 
I call these creatures sunflowers 
If we don't find them ,COMMA then we can create them ourselves 
In the long run ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it would also make it possible for us to move out there 
But in the long run ,COMMA if there's no life there ,COMMA we create it ourselves 
So again ,COMMA we have a big and wonderful future to look forward .PERIOD 
Thank you 
And i realized ,COMMA then i had to go to design school 
Or what's this num lock key ,COMMA for ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that thing 
And i didn't want to be a colorist 
And that allows me to check my timer discretely .PERIOD here ,COMMA without bending my elbow 
And something a little bit more experimental .PERIOD this is a light fixture for swarovski .PERIOD and what it does is it changes shape .PERIOD 
And the new experience ,COMMA i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light ,COMMA all the way to a bright work light 
I want to point at something here on the left 
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game 
The bottles connect together ,COMMA and you can create different shapes .PERIOD different forms .PERIOD 
And then the integration of all these great technologies ,COMMA which you've heard about ,COMMA the wi-fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen ,COMMA which you can read in sunlight ,COMMA the keyboard ,COMMA which is made out of rubber ,COMMA and it's protected from the environment 
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom ,COMMA you can just say you like the design 
Much of my life has been a quest to get some answers to these questions 
I was born and raised here in india .PERIOD and i learned from an early age to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles who would bend down ,COMMA pat us on the head .PERIOD and then say to my parents with no problem at all poor things ,COMMA you only have three daughters 
Late that night i heard my mother begging ,COMMA my father ,COMMA please do something ramu can't you ?QUESTIONMARK intervene ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is tradition 
She said to me ,COMMA it is not about the burka .PERIOD 
Had i heard right 
She is on the taliban's hit list ,COMMA 
Their path is their own ,COMMA and it looks towards an afghanistan that will be different 
Their repertoire includes the croatian national anthem ,COMMA a bosnian love song and serbian duets 
In the middle ages ,COMMA troubadours would travel across the land singing their tales and sharing .PERIOD their verses ,COMMA lesbor travels through the balkans .PERIOD like this singing ,COMMA connecting people ,COMMA divided by religion ,COMMA nationality and language .PERIOD 
The world ,COMMA layma bowie was given was a world at war .PERIOD 
At the next friday sermon ,COMMA the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque began to share their distress at the state of affairs 
In a now famous cnn clip ,COMMA you can see them sitting on the ground ,COMMA their arms ,COMMA linked 
The police are called in to physically remove the women 
And then you realize that by integrating aspects of tradition and community into their struggles ,COMMA women like sakena and leah and layma -- but also women like sonia gandhi here in india and michelle bachelet ,COMMA in chile and shirin ebadi in iran -- are doing something else .PERIOD 
And the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was go to mecca and visit the kaaba the holiest shrine of islam ,COMMA 
And i did that i put on my ritualistic dress .PERIOD i went to the holy mosque .PERIOD i did my prayers .PERIOD i observed all the rituals 
In other words ,COMMA men and women were worshiping all together .PERIOD 
And i think it's not an accident that you don't find this idea in the very origin of islam ,COMMA 
On the other hand ,COMMA the westerners who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains 
And the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen ,COMMA by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hijab the islamic head cover 
Let me give you an example in turkey ,COMMA where i come from ,COMMA which is a very hyper-secular republic ,COMMA until very recently ,COMMA we used to have what i call secularism police ,COMMA which would guard the universities against veiled students .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA they would force students to uncover their heads ,COMMA and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it .PERIOD 
Which means that muslims can today ,COMMA look at those things and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the core of our religion is here to stay with us .PERIOD 
And even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam -- which is actually a practice that i think is against islam .PERIOD but some obviously extremists did not think that way 
And i think the west at least some powers in the west ,COMMA particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators ,COMMA thinking that they were more helpful for their interests .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA in the past two decades ,COMMA thanks to globalization .PERIOD thanks to the market economy .PERIOD thanks to the rise of a middle-class ,COMMA we in turkey .PERIOD see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism 
As a photographer for national geographic ,COMMA i've portrayed it for many 
And where that energy touches water ,COMMA something new emerges life 
Shallow seas nurtured life early on ,COMMA and that's where it morphed into more complex forms .PERIOD 
The fundamental forms of ferns followed to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds .PERIOD 
Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era 
Jurassic park still shimmers in part of madagascar .PERIOD and the center of brazil where plants called cycads remain rock hard .PERIOD 
Flamingos covered continents migrations got underway 
Water lilies were among the first 
In africa ,COMMA gondwana molded proteas 
Tropical rainforests arose ,COMMA sparking new layers of interdependence .PERIOD 
A trick shared by the largest flower on earth ,COMMA 
An asteroid hits ,COMMA and the world went down in flames 
Primates emerge from jungles ,COMMA as tarsiers first ,COMMA becoming lemurs not much later 
And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next 
Today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war 
But let's start at the beginning 
Well ,COMMA notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the middle east darfur ,COMMA iraq elsewhere ,COMMA there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news .PERIOD 
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be 
Thus even though every civilian killed ,COMMA maimed ,COMMA raped ,COMMA or tortured is one too many ,COMMA the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago ,COMMA is good news 
But let's look at the good news again ,COMMA 
But then is northern ireland ,COMMA a unique example or does this kind of explanation only hold more generally in democratic and developed countries 
A final example .PERIOD kosovo 
Central among them are three 
By the same token -- and here we have some good news again -- the very fact that there is a high-level ,COMMA well-resourced international presence in kosovo and the balkans region .PERIOD more generally .PERIOD and the fact that local leaders on both sides have showed relative restraint ,COMMA explains why things have not been worse over the past two years since 2008 ,COMMA 
A final thought ending civil wars is a process that is fraught with dangers ,COMMA frustrations and setbacks ,COMMA 
Thank you 
I'm going to talk about some of my discoveries around the world through my work 
And at that young age ,COMMA 10 years old ,COMMA benki became the paje of his community 
He went 3000 miles ,COMMA on an odyssey to rio to the earth summit to tell the world ,COMMA what was happening in his tiny ,COMMA little corner 
Benki came back to his village full of ideas -- new technologies ,COMMA new research ,COMMA new ways of understanding what was going on 
He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest 
Together ,COMMA he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers 
Why are you putting yourself at risk 
So when i think of that ,COMMA i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren ,COMMA when they ask themselves that question ,COMMA i wonder how they will answer 
For me ,COMMA the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside 
You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done ,COMMA because we'll get the results .PERIOD we've always gotten 
We have to change 
It's imperative to me when i look around the world that we need to change ourselves 
Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an ngo .PERIOD she started her career as university professor teaching english literature 
They take care of 20000-odd people today in over 1000 villages ,COMMA around karnataka .PERIOD 
They've pioneered a different approach to villages 
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets ,COMMA as is so often the case ,COMMA they bring theater troupes ,COMMA songs ,COMMA music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA 
Sanghamitra told me just last week -- she had just come back from two weeks in the villages ,COMMA and she had a real breakthrough .PERIOD 
He has nine other buildings -- that are already open to the public -- filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary chinese history .PERIOD 
They looked outside ,COMMA and then they changed .PERIOD what was on the inside ,COMMA 
They've gone away from what they did before ,COMMA and they've gone to something ,COMMA they didn't know 
He went around once ,COMMA he went around twice ,COMMA he went around ,COMMA thrice ,COMMA 
And so ,COMMA when you study it ,COMMA you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world 
Perhaps he was a jain monk like bahubali over here .PERIOD the gomateshwara bahubali whose image is not far from mysore .PERIOD 
Alexander asked what are you doing 
And they both laughed 
What should you not be 
You should not be sisyphus who rolls a rock up a mountain all day ,COMMA only to find the boulder rolled down at night .PERIOD 
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say ,COMMA i was here .PERIOD first 
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist 
But they were not two characters on two different adventures ,COMMA 
You see ,COMMA the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead .PERIOD 
You go again and again and again ,COMMA 
Two different mythologies .PERIOD two different ways of looking at the world 
And i believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired indian mathematicians to discover the number zero 
Who knows 
Standard business model .PERIOD vision .PERIOD mission values .PERIOD processes 
You see ,COMMA this is what india is today .PERIOD the ground reality is based on a cyclical world view .PERIOD 
I have personally experienced it .PERIOD i'm trained as a medical doctor .PERIOD 
And he knew very intuitively that best practices developed in japan and china and europe and america will not work in india .PERIOD 
You can't measure it ,COMMA you can't manage it 
After a leader completes his training ,COMMA and is about to take over the store .PERIOD we blindfold him ,COMMA we surround him with the stakeholders ,COMMA the customer ,COMMA his family ,COMMA his team ,COMMA his boss 
That sensitivity is what we need .PERIOD once this belief enters behavior will happen .PERIOD business will happen .PERIOD 
But that was interesting in itself .PERIOD this is companies like vonage 
The little box has your phone number 
It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me ,COMMA try out skype .PERIOD for the first time ,COMMA which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad ,COMMA 
They don't want to pay the international fees ,COMMA so they're like timmy is that you 
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone and any time you were in a wireless hotspot -- free calls anywhere in the world ,COMMA never pay the cellular company ,COMMA a nickel .PERIOD 
And when you're out of the hotspot ,COMMA you're on the regular cellular network 
You're thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA how often am i in a hotspot 
Because they give you a regular wireless router that works with the phone for your house 
They don't have that kind of money .PERIOD instead ,COMMA they give each of us a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box .PERIOD they're like a stealth tower installation program ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA i'm leaving the house dp .PERIOD i'm going for a walk -- do you mind 
I don't know why my wife says i never listen to her .PERIOD i don't get that 
I have two cellphones .PERIOD so this going to be very odd .PERIOD if it works 
Excuse me one second ,COMMA 
All right ,COMMA we've made the point 
The beauty of that is you never miss a call 
Google bought it ,COMMA and they've been working on it for a year 
I actually got a photograph of the verizon employee right there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Anyway ,COMMA so lets say you need a drugstore near chicago .PERIOD 
Here it comes 
And it's already written down -- so like ,COMMA if you're driving ,COMMA you don't have to do one of these things .PERIOD uh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK uh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK uh ,COMMA huh .PERIOD 
Shortly i'll tell you why i was in milan 
That's cute ,COMMA i do have an email address .PERIOD you can just ask me 
It's absolutely phenomenal .PERIOD the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text -- send a text message nobody over 40 knows how to do that 
So i'm going to teach you something even better 
They put this teeny-weeny little ad about 10 characters long 
Because there is one 
As you can imagine ,COMMA it's college kids and old people 
When i call to leave you a message ,COMMA i get 15 seconds of instructions from a third-grade teacher on .PERIOD ambien 
So now i'm going to tell you how to get out of that 
The reason i think that is that on the first day ,COMMA i tried one of these services ,COMMA i got two voicemail messages .PERIOD one was from a guy named michael stevenson ,COMMA which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe ,COMMA and it was misspelled 
I love my job 
I'm not kidding .PERIOD you the message said was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency 
And lastly ,COMMA i just have to talk about this one 
Phone ?QUESTIONMARK well that's good 
What are you doing 
Actually even so he was turned down by verizon and others .PERIOD 
It's got bad things and good things lets all acknowledge that right now 
It's absurd ,COMMA we have power outlets in every room of every building .PERIOD we have running water .PERIOD 
You type in what you want ,COMMA and it gives you the translation 
I know it's insane ,COMMA right 
It will immediately play you that song ,COMMA or that band ,COMMA 
If you like that one or don't like it ,COMMA you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down .PERIOD over time it tailors the songs so that it completely stops playing bad songs 
It proposes a restaurant 
And now the end is near 
I want an iphone 
Who cares if it's at&ampt 
Because the breast has become are very political organ 
I will do my best this morning to tell you what i think is the truth 
But first ,COMMA my disclosures 
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump 
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the united states preventive services task force reviewed the world's mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s .PERIOD 
Screening the average young woman with an mri is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a hummer 
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge ,COMMA bulky tubes ,COMMA and they were filled with these scintillating crystals ,COMMA and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors 
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement ,COMMA but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system 
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells ,COMMA but not by normal cells .PERIOD and this is the key difference from mammography 
Our big break came in 2004 
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors .PERIOD we used these images to submit a grant to the susan g .PERIOD komen foundation 
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1000 women with dense breasts ,COMMA comparing a screening mammogram to an mbi 
Here's an example from that screening study 
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail ,COMMA from the worrisome finding 
But i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image 
After the fourth rejection ,COMMA we requested reconsideration of the manuscript .PERIOD because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .PERIOD 
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it ,COMMA many years later and most women ,COMMA thankfully ,COMMA survive 
So i worked with white noise 
And do ,COMMA not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound 
But it is just physiology .PERIOD it's just in your brain 
So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive ,COMMA i create a ball ,COMMA a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from and roll at home ,COMMA or at work ,COMMA towards aggressive noise ,COMMA and emits white noise in order to neutralize it 
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend 
Anyway ,COMMA in this same kind of approach i designed k 
I'm just a designer ,COMMA so i need them 
And the irony for me was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i didn't do that .PERIOD for the sake of science progress ,COMMA 
I just do that to make money 
So we took too many of them 
This one is an antibiotic 
But in this case ,COMMA it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient 
So the idea is all night long the elastic skin of the third lung ,COMMA will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules for sure 
You have to know ,COMMA or you probably already know ,COMMA that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one 
So while i'm talking to you ,COMMA the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas sorry for that .PERIOD 
So your sofa ,COMMA your plastic chair ,COMMA your kid's toys give their own invisible reality .PERIOD and this one is very toxic .PERIOD 
This one is kind of the same approach ,COMMA because i include in a product like andrea ,COMMA some plants 
Indeed ,COMMA this object is a domestic farm ,COMMA for fishes and green ,COMMA 
So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food ,COMMA 
After it goes back into the fish tank ,COMMA 
Now we can eat local food .PERIOD 
See like this one 
You can see it there 
We're the new technologists 
I think about world war ii -- some of our great technologists ,COMMA then some of our great physicists ,COMMA studying nuclear fission ,COMMA and fusion -- just nuclear stuff 
We want the people building the technology thinking about what we should be doing with the technology 
So we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good 
So to get people warmed up ,COMMA let's start with an easy question -- something i'm sure everybody .PERIOD here has an opinion about iphone versus android .PERIOD 
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this 
In math ,COMMA we know the objective facts 
It's an objective truth about the form of two ,COMMA the abstract form 
Then you would know what was really just ,COMMA and what wasn't 
If you think that way you have a platonist moral framework 
He thought it was impractical 
It's just a matter of the consequences 
Kant ,COMMA was very good on this point ,COMMA and he said it a little better than i'll say it 
What should we be doing ?QUESTIONMARK what's the answer 
There's not a formula 
And don't just find another technologist friend ,COMMA find somebody different than you 
We care what happens in that opera ,COMMA 
In the early '80s ,COMMA some would say 
The gang had no way to make money 
So he was a math major in college who had a good heart and decided he wanted to get a sociology ,COMMA phd came to the university of chicago 
And in his own words ,COMMA he looked like a freak 
So he showed up at the university of chicago 
There was a lot of gunfire .PERIOD there were a lot of philosophical discussions .PERIOD he had with the gang members 
And you ,COMMA and i probably faced with the situation would think ,COMMA well ,COMMA i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead 
But the thing that really makes the gang seem like mcdonald's is its franchisees 
So what do the wages look like ?QUESTIONMARK so you might be surprised 
We found in our gang -- and admittedly ,COMMA this was not really sort of a standard situation .PERIOD this was a time of intense violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful .PERIOD but there were costs 
That makes you pause -- gives you some pause -- those of you who believe that a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime .PERIOD 
That the young people controlled the gang -- that as you got older ,COMMA you dropped out of the gang 
So what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time -- the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid- to late '80s -- became very ,COMMA very wealthy 
You know ,COMMA he would say to his friends ,COMMA hey ,COMMA look at all the money .PERIOD i got in the gang 
Often our theories fail quite miserably when we go to the data 
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics called a compensating differential 
It's why we think garbage men might be paid more than people who work in parks .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
So in the words of one of the members of the gang ,COMMA i think makes this clear 
And the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely 
If you start taking losses ,COMMA they see you as weak and shit 
And i thought about it ,COMMA and i said ceos often ,COMMA pay themselves million-dollar bonuses .PERIOD even when companies are losing a lot of money ,COMMA 
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .PERIOD 
You can see the skydiver with the red suit ,COMMA he's in a stand-up position .PERIOD 
This is a jump ,COMMA i did in rio de janeiro .PERIOD 
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger from the monk .PERIOD and from the jungfrau ,COMMA three very famous mountains in switzerland ,COMMA 
June cohen ,COMMA i have some questions 
Yet ,COMMA but people are trying are you among those -- you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's a dream .PERIOD it's a dream .PERIOD yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
And is that how you usually fly 
Do people come to you with projects and say we want you to do this 
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting 
The show was in a sense about that 
I also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog .PERIOD some haze 
And what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space 
What does it matter 
It makes a difference ,COMMA whether you say i'm a part of this city ,COMMA 
It's quite simple and fundamental 
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at 
Or is that a three-hour hike ,COMMA or is that a whole day i'm looking at 
If you have a waterfall in there right out there at the horizon ,COMMA you look at the waterfall ,COMMA and you go .PERIOD oh ,COMMA the water is falling really slowly 
And experience is not just a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way .PERIOD 
So art ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA i think holds an incredible relevance in the world in which we're moving into ,COMMA particularly right now ,COMMA 
What i really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words 
So what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by nathalia crane 
The next poem is ,COMMA if no one ever marries me 
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children 
Just bring it down a little 
Thank you so much 
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius ,COMMA frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas .PERIOD 
And quite often we sit in a design meeting ,COMMA and we discover that there is this great idea 
But for another client in another culture ,COMMA it could really be the right answer to a different question .PERIOD 
And they chose this mascot because the theme of the expo is better city better life ,COMMA 
But then we looked at recent urban development ,COMMA and we noticed that this is like a shanghai street .PERIOD 30 years ago ,COMMA all bikes .PERIOD no cars .PERIOD 
So if you come to the expo ,COMMA go straight to the danish pavilion ,COMMA get a danish bike ,COMMA and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions 
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath ,COMMA we're actually going to put the actual little mermaid 
So the second story that i'd like to tell is actually starts in my own house ,COMMA 
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes ,COMMA we could actually turn the entire facade into a gigantic ,COMMA naturally ventilated ,COMMA rasterized image 
It has no water .PERIOD it has no energy ,COMMA no resources .PERIOD 
They accumulate the solar energy 
Yes ,COMMA maybe just to round off 
I'm just going to list some of them 
Where should we start on solving these problems 
To climate change that would be like kyoto ,COMMA 
I'd love to go into and get you to think about this process ,COMMA and that's actually what we did 
Of course ,COMMA you have to ask yourself ,COMMA why on earth was such a list never done before 
Nobody wants to do this 
We'd like to know these things 
Three of the world's top experts saying ,COMMA what can we do 
What would be the price 
And of course ,COMMA i'm very happy .PERIOD you asked that question -- -- because that's a very good question .PERIOD 
This offends a lot of people ,COMMA and that's probably one of the things where people will say ,COMMA i shouldn't come back either 
And i'd like to talk about that ,COMMA because that's really curious 
The reason why they came up with saying that kyoto -- or doing something more than kyoto -- is a bad deal is simply because it's very inefficient .PERIOD 
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world ,COMMA we wouldn't want to do it 
There are many problems out there in the world 
And what i want to make sure of is if we actually focus on problems that we focus on the right ones 
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we'll be even richer than that ,COMMA 
We have ,COMMA you know the day after tomorrow -- it looks great ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not about making things that have the most media attention ,COMMA but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good 
But the point ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is still to say ,COMMA if you get another 100 billion dollars ,COMMA we still want to spend that in the best possible way .PERIOD don't we 
So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .PERIOD 
My studio in bali was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest ,COMMA and monkeys ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are supposed to be the happiest of all animals 
The serif is not really in place 
And the rider thinks that he can tell the elephant ,COMMA what to do ,COMMA but the elephant really has his own ideas 
And from that point of view ,COMMA we turned it into a lovely project 
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath 
And then we're ready to add the living organism 
And actually in hot weather ,COMMA i can just grow it outside 
But i do think it could be quite a smart ,COMMA and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Suzanne lee ,COMMA 
I made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this 
How do the taliban in your area get people to join them ,COMMA 
Then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran ,COMMA 
They ask us to use them only against the infidels .PERIOD 
Soc ,COMMA i in my research have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children ,COMMA and i think it's a five-step process .PERIOD 
These children are explicitly forbidden from reading newspapers ,COMMA listening to radio reading any books that the teachers do not prescribe them .PERIOD 
Effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information for these children 
He blew himself up killing six 
Two years ago here at ted i reported that we had discovered at saturn with the cassini spacecraft ,COMMA an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small saturnine moon .PERIOD enceladus ,COMMA seen here .PERIOD 
While they're not amino acids ,COMMA we're now finding things like propane and benzene ,COMMA hydrogen cyanide .PERIOD and formaldehyde 
So we are very encouraged by these results 
And this is quite an extraordinary idea ,COMMA but it is reality today .PERIOD 
This was created by an architectural firm called shiro 
And you can actually walk into it 
Now 3d printing can break away barriers in design ,COMMA which challenge the constraints of mass production .PERIOD 
There's a lower chance of rejection 
The piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible .PERIOD 
I don't think that will happen soon 
We're now instead of shipping a product across the world ,COMMA we're sending data across the internet .PERIOD 
And applying this to the idea of building up what's in our bodies 
So one of the pioneers ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is dr .PERIOD anthony atala .PERIOD and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts -- bladders ,COMMA valves ,COMMA kidneys 
We like different things 
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years .PERIOD and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty .PERIOD what does it mean 
And i would see kids on the street corners ,COMMA and they'd say obama ,COMMA he's our brother 
And she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the poverty wasn't so bad .PERIOD it was the humiliation .PERIOD and the embarrassment of it ,COMMA all 
And i say 'look at me ,COMMA you are not dead 
And in the middle of this economic crisis ,COMMA where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear .PERIOD i think we're well suited to take a cue from jane and reach out ,COMMA recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary 
It was a really big excitement for me to get into caltech 
And i concluded ,COMMA after researching ,COMMA every other technology that we could deploy for storing energy -- flywheels ,COMMA different formulations of batteries -- it just wasn't practical to store energy 
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that .PERIOD but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy 
So i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity ,COMMA 
Traditionally ,COMMA concentrators look like this 
Your efficiency goes down with more bounces ,COMMA because you lose about 10 percent with each bounce .PERIOD but this allowed us to collect light from a plus or minus 25 degree ,COMMA angle .PERIOD 
So once you have mobility .PERIOD now you're making a lot of engines ,COMMA because you've got lots of units as opposed to steam ships ,COMMA or big factories where you're not making as many units .PERIOD so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines ,COMMA didn't benefit 
So we tried to look at the stirling engine in a new way ,COMMA because it was practical -- weight ,COMMA no ,COMMA longer mattered for our application ,COMMA the internal combustion engine took off because weight mattered because you were moving around 
So someone came up with a very clever idea to -- instead of heating the whole cylinder and cooling the whole cylinder ,COMMA what about if you put a displacer inside -- a little thing that shuttles the air back and forth 
We measured each one ,COMMA we readjusted the model to what we measured .PERIOD and then we led that to the current prototype 
It led to a very compact ,COMMA inexpensive engine .PERIOD and this is what the engine looks like .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA an example of that is ,COMMA here's the map of the united states 
And of course ,COMMA look at africa 
There's 10000 watts of light pouring on the stage ,COMMA one horsepower is 756 watts ,COMMA at full power ,COMMA 
But everywhere around us ,COMMA we have insatiable use for energy ,COMMA because it's so cheap 
And it's cheap ,COMMA because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun .PERIOD 
Headlines that look like this ,COMMA when they have to do with climate change and headlines that look like this ,COMMA when they have to do with air quality or smog 
And this is the tower from below 
So as you can imagine the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane ,COMMA you would take on vacation 
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule ,COMMA 
What i am always thinking about is what this session is about ,COMMA which is called simplicity 
So i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child 
And that was a good thing to help ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the cause 
But then he came back and things happened .PERIOD and i decided i really hated my writing that it was awful .PERIOD awful ,COMMA purple prose 
Well ,COMMA tibor really started the studio called m&ampco 
That to be able to talk about content to break apart ,COMMA what you normally expect to use humor and surprise ,COMMA elegance and humanity .PERIOD in your work was really important to us .PERIOD 
I don't really -- i mean ,COMMA i could tell you that i didn't understand .PERIOD i'm not proud of it ,COMMA but i didn't understand ,COMMA let's say ,COMMA 95 percent of the talks at this conference 
So i'm open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new 
And so i was able to put that into this story ,COMMA which is an alphabet ,COMMA and hopefully go on to something else .PERIOD 
I work for the new yorker ,COMMA and i do covers and 9/11 happened .PERIOD and it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it 
We hoped we'd be funny ,COMMA but we didn't know it would be a cover .PERIOD and we didn't know that that image at the moment that it happened would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people 
And david remnick who was really wonderful about it had one problem .PERIOD he didn't like al zheimers because he thought it would insult people with alzheimer's 
And he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug 
So what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing ,COMMA and i think that music is the highest form of all art .PERIOD 
I happen to know it for a fact 
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs ,COMMA but stalin was ,COMMA a paranoid man ,COMMA even more than my father 
Which i think i made up ,COMMA which is a good thing 
I received a box in the mail ,COMMA and it was wrapped with newspaper .PERIOD and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper ,COMMA and he was dead 
And i really spend a lot of time wondering how much truth do we tell 
How do we know when we are ourselves 
A quote by bertrand russell all ,COMMA the labor of all the ages .PERIOD all the devotion ,COMMA all the inspiration ,COMMA all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .PERIOD 
And i would like to run it for them 
And it says ,COMMA ich habe genug ,COMMA which is a bach cantata ,COMMA which i once thought meant i've had it .PERIOD i can't take it anymore .PERIOD give me a break ,COMMA but i was wrong 
I thought that things would be pretty fun ,COMMA and there would be more things to play with 
So since we've been here this week ,COMMA we've taken millions of breaths ,COMMA collectively ,COMMA and perhaps we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives .PERIOD but we often miss the very subtle changes 
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars with motors with neurons ,COMMA 
We're concerned in the national security community ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA in the biology community and the public health community 
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic .PERIOD birds 
So ,COMMA what have people been doing with this money 
Let's everybody run around and play your role 
Most local facilities ,COMMA would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu ,COMMA which may or may not be helpful -- i'll get into that -- of available vaccines ,COMMA and any other treatments ,COMMA and masks and anything that's been stockpiled 
And you'll have massive competition 
During the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help 
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask ,COMMA and then they rubbed their nose .PERIOD bingo ?QUESTIONMARK they got sars .PERIOD 
The pandemic circulated ,COMMA three times in 18 months in the absence of commercial air ,COMMA travel 
This was based on european and north american data 
And that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people before we had commercial air travel 
So are we ready 
If you expand that out to think of a whole community ,COMMA or all your employees in your company ,COMMA you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option might be 
But really do you really have a place to stockpile 18 months worth of food .PERIOD twenty-four months worth of food 
Do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu .PERIOD 
And i hope i've convinced you of that ,COMMA which means that the real job is go out and say ,COMMA to your local leaders and your national leaders .PERIOD why haven't you solved these problems 
But can you sustain your company that way 
The moment that you see any evidence of serious human-to-human to transmission 
The mechanism isn't clear 
Again ,COMMA we don't really know for sure 
Audience member :COLON one of the things i've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia ,COMMA and that a pneumonia vaccine may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival 
And so far in the h5n1 cases in people .PERIOD similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at all 
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery because those t-cells don't recognize it either 
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming ,COMMA although i'm known to make my dreams come true .PERIOD 
One two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six and seven 
And i go to see a famous magician and proudly ask him .PERIOD well ,COMMA what do you think 
For the move to be professional ,COMMA it has to be less than one second .PERIOD and it has to be perfect 
But in america you have to explain what are clubs .PERIOD 
They have to be precisely lathed ,COMMA 
Anyway ,COMMA here i was progressing with my new clubs .PERIOD 
The clubs were escaping me at each throw 
So i proudly showed him my clubs 
He said ,COMMA philippe ,COMMA you have been had 
They are impossible to juggle 
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers ,COMMA and i gather them together in some kind of ropey path 
Well ,COMMA within a few days ,COMMA i'm able to do one crossing 
If not i will never do that first step 
It's a straight line ,COMMA which sags ,COMMA which sways ,COMMA which vibrates ,COMMA which rolls on itself ,COMMA which is ice ,COMMA which is three tons tight ,COMMA ready to explode .PERIOD ready to swallow me .PERIOD 
An inner howl assails me ,COMMA the wild longing to flee 
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic in breaking records 
And something happened 
He didn't know the true story 
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature ,COMMA their complex structure ,COMMA the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty 
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy 
These are not epiphyte roots ?QUESTIONMARK these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves .PERIOD 
We know ,COMMA it's a lot ,COMMA but we do not yet know the answers to how much and by what processes carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere ,COMMA held in its biomass and moving on through the ecosystem 
They ended up making a cd which they took home to their family and friends ,COMMA thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium .PERIOD 
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work 
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses ,COMMA 
We gave talks once a month and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons -- organic gardens ,COMMA worm culture ,COMMA recycling ,COMMA water catchment and beekeeping 
As many of you are aware ,COMMA the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one 
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships with people outside of the academic community 
When i look into my heart ,COMMA i see trees -- this is actually an image of a real heart -- there are trees in our hearts .PERIOD there are trees in your hearts ,COMMA 
It was taken 18 years ago ,COMMA 
There is a problem with scuba though ,COMMA in that it imposes some limitations on how deep you can go .PERIOD and it turns out that depth is about 200 feet 
And there's a phenomenon called henry's law ,COMMA that says that gases will dissolve into a fluid in proportion to the partial pressures which you're exposing them to 
You die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater ,COMMA not a good thing to happen .PERIOD underwater .PERIOD 
This picture was taken ,COMMA 300 feet ,COMMA deep catching new species of fish 
And indeed ,COMMA there is a better way .PERIOD 
Alright ,COMMA closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba ?QUESTIONMARK and why is it better ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there are three main advantages to a rebreather ,COMMA 
So we need another gas something to dilute the oxygen with 
But if we want to go deeper ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we need another gas supply 
Now ,COMMA normally you don't have to do that ,COMMA because all of it's done automatically for you with the electronics .PERIOD the third system of a rebreather ,COMMA 
And yes ,COMMA it's a little nerve-wracking 
So sharks aren't quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be 
There's a cover story all about the great explorers of our time .PERIOD 
The last article is an article entitled no new frontiers 
Even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing ,COMMA just look at the monetary value of this thing .PERIOD 
And then eventually i got around to looking in my bucket 
Now this one's pretty cool .PERIOD 
So a very large percentage of what is out there isn't really known 
We thought we had a handle on all the reef fish diversity -- evidently ,COMMA not 
At the beginning ,COMMA i told you that i was going to show you two extraordinary photographs 
The reason i show this -- not to put a downer on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosophy of life in general ,COMMA which is that we all have two goals 
The first goal we share with every other living thing on this planet ,COMMA which is to survive .PERIOD i call it perpetuation :COLON the survival of the species and survival of ourselves ,COMMA because they're both about perpetuating the genome .PERIOD 
You have to balance those two goals 
But here's what really perplexed me .PERIOD 
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms ,COMMA without even doing an ecg ,COMMA or a chest x-ray to look at the heart 
Yet ,COMMA despite all the advances in medical technology ,COMMA the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited 
And then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally ,COMMA applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children 
And another program called statistical probability mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child's symptoms .PERIOD 
When we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin's brain ,COMMA the results were startling 
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects non-invasively and find the true source of so many disabilities in children 
It's something like life that once you get in it ,COMMA you can't get out 
There are two clips i want to show you .PERIOD the first one is a kind of hodgepodge ,COMMA its just three little moments ,COMMA four little moments with three of the people who are here tonight 
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding ,COMMA people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads ,COMMA dumping them in the forms .PERIOD 
So those are the two clips ,COMMA i'm going to show 
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station ,COMMA it was so consistent with his life .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
Man ,COMMA yes ,COMMA it is the national image of bangladesh 
No ,COMMA he never saw this 
And this is the largest project he has got in here .PERIOD the poorest country in the world 
It's a story of nations of ideologies ,COMMA of territories ,COMMA and of conflicts among them 
Here 
Are we alone in this vast universe of energy and matter and chemistry and physics ,COMMA 
Whether we're born in san francisco or sudan or close to the heart of the milky way galaxy ,COMMA we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust 
Well ,COMMA what about 10^22 
That line would have to be 38 million miles above this stage ,COMMA 
I think this is what david deutsch meant in 2005 ,COMMA when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living ,COMMA and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .PERIOD 
We've been searching ever since ,COMMA but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains 
And over those long distances ,COMMA its signal is very faint when it reaches us .PERIOD 
But this is a simple signal ,COMMA and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals .PERIOD 
This is a very good year 
2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo's first use of the telescope ,COMMA darwin's 200th birthday ,COMMA the 150th anniversary of the publication of on the origin of species ,COMMA the 50th anniversary of seti as a science ,COMMA the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA the 25th anniversary of ted 
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust to build an environment ,COMMA where raw data could be stored ,COMMA and where it could be accessed and manipulated ,COMMA where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient 
I'm sorry ,COMMA seth godin ,COMMA but over the millennia .PERIOD we've seen where tribalism leads 
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages 
Ten times a day ,COMMA they extract the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals laid down by snow .PERIOD season ,COMMA after season ,COMMA for thousands of years ,COMMA 
From this ,COMMA we can detect an extraordinary number of things 
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics ,COMMA 
They have to ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero ,COMMA otherwise the key gases inside it will dissipate 
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map ,COMMA and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended 
It is a voice of experience 
It is a voice we should heed 
This thesis is set out in a book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues .PERIOD and i wrote and have posted for free at oilendgamecom -- about 170000 downloads ,COMMA so far 
So when we did ,COMMA we found some very surprising things 
And serious competition from europe from korea ,COMMA and next is china ,COMMA which will soon be a major net exporter of cars ,COMMA 
The point here is these cars are going to be made ,COMMA super efficient ,COMMA 
The question is ,COMMA who will make them 
It's financeable in the private capital market 
And in the upper left ,COMMA a pioneering effort 14 years ago ,COMMA by gm -- 84 miles a gallon ,COMMA without even using a hybrid .PERIOD in a four-seater 
In the airplane business .PERIOD it's again ,COMMA a similar story ,COMMA where the first 20 percent fuel saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner 
And it turns out that these are quite remarkable for safety 
The golf was totaled 
Because these materials could actually absorb six to 12 times as much energy per pound as steel ,COMMA and do so a lot more smoothly 
This expands choice rapidly in the market ,COMMA and actually makes more money for automakers as well .PERIOD 
I'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country by making it very cheaply possible for low-income families to get efficient ,COMMA reliable ,COMMA warranted new cars that they could otherwise never get 
This creates a new million-car-a-year market for detroit from customers ,COMMA they weren't going to get otherwise ,COMMA because they weren't creditworthy and could never afford a new car 
It turns out that if say african-american and white households had the same car ownership ,COMMA it would cut employment disparity about in half by providing better access to job opportunities 
Just turn it over to the private sector ,COMMA and we have an internet 
Ours is on the demand side .PERIOD 
I was just coming out of a failed ,COMMA virtual reality business and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit and writing books -- after twenty years ,COMMA or so ,COMMA in the computer game industry ,COMMA having ideas that people didn't think they could sell 
And at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states ,COMMA after two years ,COMMA we pulled together some survey data from another 10000 children ,COMMA drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research ,COMMA and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics ,COMMA for designing computer-based products -- and in fact ,COMMA any kind of products -- for little girls ,COMMA ages eight to 12 
And these voices will be accompanied by photographs that they took for us of their lives of the things that they value and care about 
Girl 3 ,COMMA this is my pretend [unclear] one 
This is the second day in rockett's life 
I wanted to show you the ways ,COMMA innocuous as they seem ,COMMA in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls -- their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility and to play around with the social complexity of their lives .PERIOD 
He went through europe through world war ii ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection ,COMMA 
So he finally found an art dealer ,COMMA a dutch art dealer named han .PERIOD van meegeren who sold him ,COMMA a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars 
He had a lesser charge of forgery ,COMMA got a year sentence and died a hero to the dutch people 
Many sociologists like veblen .PERIOD and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs ,COMMA because we're focused on status 
Would you eat this 
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human 
It's simple ,COMMA you tell them they're from mcdonald's .PERIOD 
It's very simple ,COMMA pour it from an expensive bottle .PERIOD 
It will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are 
That drops the value of it suggesting that .PERIOD that's one reason why we like it 
Rather it's because i want something that has a specific history 
Who here likes the work of jackson pollock ,COMMA 
And the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment 
So he got joshua bell to take his million dollar violin down to a washington dc subway station ,COMMA and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make 
He actually made 20 dollars more than that ,COMMA but he didn't count it 
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station .PERIOD 
One lovely experiment was done by kurt gray ,COMMA and dan wegner 
And what i hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims ,COMMA unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims ,COMMA isn't a kind of nasty carping activity .PERIOD it's socially useful .PERIOD but it's also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .PERIOD 
She it turns out ,COMMA has a non-accredited correspondence course ,COMMA phd 
A glass of red wine ,COMMA a day could help prevent breast cancer 
So i'm going to tell you about one trial ,COMMA which is probably the most well-reported trial in the uk .PERIOD news ,COMMA media ,COMMA over the past decade 
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another 
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill ,COMMA taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body .PERIOD but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .PERIOD 
But that's not enough 
What i find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices ,COMMA but slightly more sophisticated versions of them in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients ,COMMA and which we use to make vitally important decisions 
And it's a foregone conclusion ,COMMA if you give a drug at that high a dose that it will have more side effects ,COMMA and that your new drug will look better .PERIOD 
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone ,COMMA so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .PERIOD 
This is a drug called reboxetine .PERIOD 
Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld ,COMMA but it goes way beyond that .PERIOD 
But the companies withheld that data from them .PERIOD and so did the european medicines agency for three years 
The infectious diseases cochrane group ,COMMA which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies ,COMMA so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not .PERIOD and they've not been able to get that information 
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today ,COMMA 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I saw people struggling to get by not knowing what was what and what was next 
You want a better life for yourself 
There's this thing ,COMMA this militarization of the world ,COMMA and it's centered right in the united states .PERIOD 
And the united states is responsible for almost one half of the world's military spending -- four percent of the world's population 
And you feel it you see it every day 
You say ,COMMA how is that possible 
And their leaders ,COMMA their leaders before they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country -- and you know the reason -- before they send them off ,COMMA they go to a christian church ,COMMA and they pray to their christian god ,COMMA and they ask for protection and guidance from that god 
Why 
They do wonderful things ,COMMA but they also do the bad things .PERIOD and you can't tell the difference 
And this guy ,COMMA you get a guy like lt ,COMMA gen ,COMMA william boykin 
And you're thinking god ,COMMA if this guy is saying that then all the soldiers must be saying that 
And this word here george bush called this war ,COMMA a crusade 
It's a holy war against muslims ,COMMA 
You feel frightened .PERIOD of course ,COMMA you feel frightened 
He wants to burn korans ,COMMA our holy book 
You don't know that 
So here 
And this is a perspective 
So here's what i want you to do 
I'm going out to defend your freedom ,COMMA your lives 
And if i can get you to step into their shoes and walk an inch ,COMMA one tiny inch ,COMMA then imagine the kind of sociological analysis that you can do in all other aspects of your life 
Thank you 
It was only in the second half of the 20th century that we slowly began to pull ourselves out of this abyss .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA in 1950 ,COMMA the typical ship carried 5000 to 10000 tons worth of goods .PERIOD 
Today a container ship can carry 150000 tons .PERIOD it can be manned with a smaller crew ,COMMA and unloaded faster than ever before ,COMMA 
And i think ,COMMA as you'll see there's reasons for optimism ,COMMA because i believe that the best is yet to come 
Well ,COMMA how else can we create new ideas 
How else can we create new ideas 
That is a good thing 
How many ramanujans are there in india today toiling in the fields ,COMMA barely able to feed themselves when they could be feeding the world 
Twenty-first century could easily be 33 even higher percent .PERIOD 
Even at that rate ,COMMA by 2100 average gdp per capita in the world will be $200000 
That's not that far 
But some of our grandchildren probably will 
What about a great depression 
Now ,COMMA let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929 ,COMMA trying to forecast future growth for the united states ,COMMA not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff ,COMMA not knowing that we were about to enter the greatest economic disaster .PERIOD certainly ,COMMA in the 20th century ,COMMA 
In the last 30 years ,COMMA thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world and advances in technology .PERIOD biologists have ,COMMA for example ,COMMA added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species ,COMMA to bring the current total to 5400 and more continue to pour in 
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered ,COMMA along with two new antelopes ,COMMA dozens of monkey species ,COMMA and a new kind of elephant -- and even a distinct kind of gorilla 
Consider the nematode roundworm ,COMMA the most abundant of all animals 
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil ,COMMA just a little handful of soil in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there 
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953 ,COMMA while a harvard graduate student searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of cuba ants that shine in the sunlight -- metallic green or metallic blue ,COMMA according to species and one species ,COMMA i discovered ,COMMA metallic gold 
And the final letter is o ,COMMA for over-harvesting -- driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing 
That's in the united states ,COMMA 
But what excites me is that since i first put forward this particular idea in that form ,COMMA science has advanced 
I wish you would help them 
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications 
The idea that in that room ,COMMA at that moment ,COMMA everyone regardless of their age ,COMMA their gender ,COMMA their race ,COMMA their color ,COMMA their religion comes together .PERIOD 
Let's start with technology 
All right ,COMMA let's start with theater .PERIOD 
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive 
Zero does not speak ,COMMA is neither man nor woman 
And that usually if you're a bit extraordinary ,COMMA if you're not exactly of human appearance ,COMMA then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .PERIOD 
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years .PERIOD 
It's a human and technological revolution 
And well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dutch can't eat all these pigs .PERIOD 
And what i was curious about -- because historically ,COMMA the whole pig would be used up until the last bit ,COMMA so nothing would be wasted -- and i was curious to find out if this was actually still the case 
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts ,COMMA like chocolate mousse ,COMMA tiramisu ,COMMA vanilla pudding ,COMMA everything that's cooled in the supermarket ,COMMA there's gelatin to make it look good 
Fine bone ,COMMA china -- this is a real classic 
I was not planning on showing you any meat ,COMMA because ,COMMA of course ,COMMA half the book's meat and you probably all know what meats they are 
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings .PERIOD so the collagen is as well 
And they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve ,COMMA because want his product to be associated with pigs ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA it is because everything that can't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source 
This is a picture of maurice druon ,COMMA the honorary perpetual secretary of l'academie francaise ,COMMA the french academy 
We see it in the constant appearance of slang and jargon ,COMMA of the historical change in languages in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages 
The problem is ,COMMA which verbs go in which constructions .PERIOD 
A transitive verb mandates that there has to be an object there .PERIOD sam devoured the pizza .PERIOD you can't just say ,COMMA sam devoured 
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type ,COMMA each of which shapes its sentence .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure ,COMMA which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language .PERIOD 
Or the meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line 
Or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose's head ,COMMA engaged in a tug of a war 
And i'll start out with a puzzle :COLON the puzzle of indirect speech acts 
For example ,COMMA in brotherhoods ,COMMA fraternal organizations ,COMMA sororities ,COMMA locutions like the family of man ,COMMA you try to get people who are not related to use the relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to close kin .PERIOD 
In that case ,COMMA the consequences are rather severe 
On the other hand ,COMMA if you extend the bribe if the officer is dishonest ,COMMA you get a huge payoff of going free 
The honest officer ,COMMA can't hold you to it as being a bribe ?QUESTIONMARK and therefore ,COMMA you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket 
Because i get to talk about one of my favorite critters ,COMMA which is the western grebe ,COMMA you haven't lived until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance 
What they said to us at first was ,COMMA you know we already do biomimicry ,COMMA 
And they said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what happens is mineral -- just like at your house -- mineral builds up .PERIOD 
So if we had some way to stop this scaling -- and so i picked up some shells on the beach ,COMMA and i asked them ,COMMA what is scaling ?QUESTIONMARK what's inside your pipes ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they didn't know that 
You know ,COMMA it's a silo ,COMMA people in silos ,COMMA they didn't know that the same thing was happening .PERIOD so one of them thought about it and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if this is just crystallization that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly -- then why aren't shells infinite in size ?QUESTIONMARK what stops the scaling 
How do we redesign the world that we make ,COMMA the human-made world 
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has 
What's the syllabus 
And thirdly ,COMMA how does life make things disappear into systems 
And at the same time ,COMMA i'm listening to a lot of businesses and finding what their sort of ,COMMA grand challenges are 
On the lower left ,COMMA there is a picture of mother of pearl forming out of seawater .PERIOD it's a layered structure that's mineral and then polymer .PERIOD and it makes it very ,COMMA very tough .PERIOD 
Here are two organisms that pull water 
Pulling water out of monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in atlanta ,COMMA before it gets into a building ,COMMA are key technologies 
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book 
That little guy over there is a tardigrade 
There is a problem with vaccines around the world ,COMMA not getting to patients .PERIOD and the reason is that the refrigeration somehow gets broken .PERIOD what's called the cold chain gets broken 
They can be put in a glove compartment .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Chris anderson :COLON talk about foreplay .PERIOD i -- we need to get to 12 ,COMMA but really quickly 
Ok ,COMMA so that's the healing one 
And really ,COMMA that's what other organisms do as well 
That's the twelfth one 
And i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling 
I mean ,COMMA here was a girl who had never lived in peace time ,COMMA who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice 
My first business was a dressmaking business i started under the taliban .PERIOD 
The imf official is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro 
And in many places ,COMMA they're there 
Because -- and i say this ,COMMA as somebody who worked in finance -- 500 billion dollars ,COMMA at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade 
Just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs ,COMMA productivity ,COMMA employment ,COMMA child nutrition ,COMMA maternal mortality ,COMMA literacy and much much more 
And not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap -- not one 
The women in my family are not exceptions .PERIOD 
The women in this room and watching in la 
Together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule 
Once upon a time in 19th century germany ,COMMA there was the book 
Now during this time ,COMMA the book was the king of storytelling ,COMMA 
His name was lothar lothar meggendorfer 
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold 
Whether storytellers realized it or not ,COMMA they were channeling meggendorfer's spirit when they moved opera to vaudville ,COMMA radio news to radio theater film to film in motion to film ,COMMA in sound color 3d on vhs and on dvd ,COMMA 
And i really want to build green ,COMMA but i'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles ,COMMA people long on moral authority and short on data ,COMMA telling me how to do these kinds of things 
Wipe it up throw it away 
Unless i use a front-loading ,COMMA high-efficiency washing machine .PERIOD and then it looks a little bit better .PERIOD 
So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize 
We wanted to know how much better we could do 
Now pvc is a little bit better ,COMMA but still not as good as the wood that we chose 
When it comes time to sheetrock ,COMMA if you use ecorock ,COMMA it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock 
If you put carpeting in your house ,COMMA it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house ,COMMA unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy ,COMMA 
So now we add in the final construction energy ,COMMA we add it all up ,COMMA and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this 
Now i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient .PERIOD and in that case ,COMMA it would take me more about 20 years to break ,COMMA even 
So what does this mean 
You might want to leave now 
So i did 
And i'm talking specifically about synanthropic species ,COMMA which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies ,COMMA species like rats and cockroaches ,COMMA and crows .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rats are incredibly responsive breeders .PERIOD 
We're seeing a population boom with crows .PERIOD 
And i'll give you an example of that 
And these crows use sticks in the wild ,COMMA to get insects and whatnot ,COMMA out of pieces of wood 
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there ,COMMA 
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts .PERIOD 
And as we heard yesterday ,COMMA that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble .PERIOD and we're starting to see it with them 
Now they're used to the sound of the machine ,COMMA and they keep coming back and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there 
The main thing ,COMMA the main point of all this for me ,COMMA is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .PERIOD 
So my grandfather told me when i was a little girl ,COMMA if you say a word often enough ,COMMA it becomes you 
Anybody out here old enough to know studs terkel .PERIOD that old radio ,COMMA man 
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word used by the people in watergate ,COMMA moral slippage -- it's a gradual kind of thing ,COMMA combination of things 
Oh ,COMMA let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit 
Just as a train is about to go a young couple rush in ,COMMA and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors 
You see ,COMMA here's huck ,COMMA he's an illiterate kid .PERIOD he's had no schooling .PERIOD but there's something in him 
You know ,COMMA most actors want to do characters that are likeable -- well ,COMMA not always ,COMMA but the notion ,COMMA especially at a conference like this .PERIOD i like to inspire people 
And i still feel as though i've got to get coffee for my male colleagues ,COMMA even though i've outlived most of them 
Everything i do is word for word off a tape 
And it didn't work didn't work 
All around her head was just swollen ,COMMA her head was about two sizes of its own size .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA 'she won't breathe' .PERIOD i knew immediately that she was dead 
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead .PERIOD so i went in ,COMMA and i put a mirror to her mouth -- there was no thing ,COMMA nothing coming out of her mouth ,COMMA 
He said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'we can't we can't let nobody find out about this' .PERIOD he say ,COMMA 'you've got to help me' .PERIOD i agree .PERIOD i agree 
And so i went to both -- two race riots ,COMMA one of which was the los angeles riot .PERIOD and this next piece is from that 
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent .PERIOD i was at that trial 
So what she's questioning here ,COMMA she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society 
We didn't qualify for medical treatment ,COMMA no food stamp ,COMMA no gr ,COMMA no welfare .PERIOD anything many african-americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive 
We didn't get any ,COMMA because we have a car and a house 
And i wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way ,COMMA 
But after the riot ,COMMA it's too much difference 
The other reason that i don't wear shoes is ,COMMA just in case i really feel like i have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes .PERIOD 
I was in a doctor's office last cat scan ,COMMA and there was a reader's digest .PERIOD october 2002 
I mean ,COMMA like even when i told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me ,COMMA she's like 'she's just talking .PERIOD she's just being nice to you .PERIOD she's not going to do that' .PERIOD and then you called me up .PERIOD and you said ,COMMA you wanted to come out here and interview me ,COMMA and she went and looked you up on the internet .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA 'look who she is 
Freedom ,COMMA it would have to be the rodeo 
I mean ,COMMA i guess it just be like -- i guess it be like the day .PERIOD my brother died 
So check it ,COMMA i'm gonna to catch mockingbirds 
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is 
I'll get the last time you lied 
I'll get a lonely little sentence with real error in it .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i guess i could come inside ,COMMA but only for a minute 
What does a violin have to do with technology 
The surface of the earth is absolutely riddled with holes .PERIOD and here we are right in the middle 
I'm on this ,COMMA 'til the whole thing spreads with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed singing hush .PERIOD little baby don't say a word 
Wow ,COMMA 
Now most media companies -- television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA publishing games ,COMMA you name it -- they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences 
And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .PERIOD 
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media .PERIOD that's actually quite surprising .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i actually don't think that's going to be the case .PERIOD 
This is far too simplistic 
So you may be asking ,COMMA well ,COMMA why is it important that i know what entertains people 
So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics .PERIOD 
Thank you so much 
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated 
And the amazing thing to me is that now you would think this woman would like have excellent oral hygiene 
I interviewed when i was working on the book ,COMMA i interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm 
It was remarkable .PERIOD it took about one minute 
And it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person ,COMMA a beating-heart cadaver 
Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person 
You know ,COMMA you can get cadavers if you work at a university 
According to 1930s marriage manual author .PERIOD theodoor van de velde .PERIOD a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman within about an hour after sexual intercourse .PERIOD 
But he wrote in this book ,COMMA ideal marriage -- he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man ,COMMA which he said ,COMMA had a fresh ,COMMA exhilarating smell ,COMMA and the semen of mature men ,COMMA whose semen smelled quote .PERIOD remarkably ,COMMA like that of the flowers of the spanish chestnut .PERIOD 
And lo and behold ,COMMA the hiccups went away 
It was called the upsuck theory .PERIOD 
This is the 1950s 
I have an answer for you ,COMMA i have two answers 
So now you have an evolutionary excuse 
Alrighty ,COMMA there is considerable evidence for upsuck in the animal kingdom -- pigs ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA 
And i also said to her now these sows .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA you may have noticed there ,COMMA the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy 
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque 
This is basically a penis camera on a motor .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA he found that in three quarters of the men ,COMMA the stuff just kind of slopped out 
And that furthers the isolation that people like john found themselves in 
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide and sitting last year at tedactive ,COMMA i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help 
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes 
And here's how to tell 
It will let you down less and not only that it looks better 
Live long and prosper ,COMMA 
It's called tidying up art ,COMMA and it's as you can see ,COMMA it's more or less a picture book 
I'd like to show them around ,COMMA so we can just ,COMMA you know -- actually i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better 
And we can see here very clearly ,COMMA it's a confusion of color .PERIOD 
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured 
Yeah ,COMMA that's great 
You can see .PERIOD now that's a good example ,COMMA even behaving in an orderly ,COMMA systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos 
That's a picture by keith haring 
In the end ,COMMA one has a list with which one then can arrange 
Tidying up rene magritte -- this is really fun 
Like books clothes ,COMMA toothbrush ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and it was great 
But then one morning ,COMMA i hang the same little sign onto that picture .PERIOD by vincent ,COMMA van gogh 
Here -- that's just my new proposal .PERIOD here for the union .PERIOD jack 
Yeah ,COMMA i think ,COMMA after you have seen that i have to leave anyway ,COMMA 
One is hierarchical pores ,COMMA and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .PERIOD 
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing right 
Those machines have no place for empathy .PERIOD 
Which was the basis of the movie .PERIOD bladerunner 
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head ,COMMA by watching all those thousand ted videos ,COMMA it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do .PERIOD so 
Each of those tedtalks has an average length of about 2300 words ,COMMA 
Or living in existential vacuum ,COMMA it sucks .PERIOD 
I mean 
For example .PERIOD dan pink's talk on motivation ,COMMA which was pretty good if you haven't seen ,COMMA it drop carrot drop ,COMMA stick .PERIOD bring meaning 
Even then ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it's not possible to summarize each tedtalk individually 
I don't know any tedtalk that contains this 
I had started out with a thousand tedtalks ,COMMA and i had 600 six-word summaries for those 
So i thought i probably have to take this one step further ,COMMA here and create summaries of the summaries -- and this is exactly what i did .PERIOD 
So he's discovering the garden 
His face by the way is fully ai-driven 
Now we need to have a bit more engagement .PERIOD and again ,COMMA what we can do is we can look at the body 
You stand up ,COMMA and you skim the stone 
And we're going to help him with this now 
But this is going to be an introduction ,COMMA and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use 
We're trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo 
He's just moved house .PERIOD he's got no friends .PERIOD 
They're always getting stressed 
Milo ,COMMA i just really miss my old house .PERIOD that's all 
But for me ,COMMA this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with where i am no longer restrained by the finger ,COMMA i hold in my hand -- as far as a computer game's concerned -- or by the blandness of not being noticed .PERIOD if you're watching a film or a book ,COMMA 
Each of you possesses the most powerful ,COMMA dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised 
I'm talking about your language ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind .PERIOD and they can attempt to do the same to you without either of you having to perform surgery 
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby ,COMMA when it first discovers that ,COMMA merely by uttering a sound ,COMMA it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic ,COMMA and maybe even into its mouth 
And this cumulative cultural adaptation .PERIOD as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives 
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands 
This remarkable image is not a map of the world 
He thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i can renovate the school 
She found a job ,COMMA she scouted for jobs for her classmates ,COMMA and her friends 
She not only changed her own dynamic .PERIOD she changed her household .PERIOD she changed her family .PERIOD her village 
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .PERIOD 
So some of you may be thinking ,COMMA gosh ,COMMA that's hyperbole 
And you know ,COMMA it happens for several reasons 
There are three reasons why ?QUESTIONMARK this is the case 
When you educate a girl ,COMMA she tends to have significantly fewer kids 
It's kind of like the dirty little secret of poverty ,COMMA which is that not only do poor people take in very little income .PERIOD but also the income that they take in .PERIOD they don't spend it very wisely .PERIOD and unfortunately ,COMMA most of that spending is done by men 
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution .PERIOD not the problem 
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves 
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders ,COMMA which is a substantial portion 
She fought off the hyenas with that stick 
She's moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle ,COMMA 
Let me tell you about saima 
And then when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace ,COMMA she needed someone to help her do the transport .PERIOD so she hired her husband 
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop 
She never broke down 
So here's the cause 
Join the movement 
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change .PERIOD and here's yet another new york times article just like every other darn one .PERIOD you've seen 
And we've accomplished close to zip 
And there are times you might like to do something quick 
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally ,COMMA 
And the answer seems to be ,COMMA yes ,COMMA 
It just sunk below the surface .PERIOD we weren't allowed to speak about it 
And in fact ,COMMA he had some ideas to make them go away 
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly .PERIOD heated 
So the side facing the sun is warmer ,COMMA the side away cooler .PERIOD 
And so you see a net force away from the sun 
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs 
We need a broader debate 
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering .PERIOD we do what we ought to do ,COMMA which is get serious about cutting emissions 
But i have a lot of reservations .PERIOD 
And it's time to begin thinking about it .PERIOD even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it 
And oddly ,COMMA the most notable letter of rejection i ever received came from walt disney world ,COMMA a seemingly innocuous site ,COMMA 
And i wanted to see the center with my own eyes .PERIOD but what i came away with is a photograph 
And it's just another place from which to observe ,COMMA and the understanding that there are no absolute ,COMMA all-knowing insiders ,COMMA 
In this context ,COMMA i'll just show you a few 
This is a cryopreservation unit ,COMMA and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer robert ettinger ,COMMA who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health ,COMMA with advancements in science and technology all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars for forever .PERIOD 
And in this ,COMMA i really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting .PERIOD so i spent some time with the smells and items .PERIOD 
And the film was shot on .PERIOD 72 millimeter ,COMMA government-issue film .PERIOD 
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction ,COMMA and its influence on memory ,COMMA which can lead to severe ,COMMA even lethal consequences 
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images 
But through exposure to composite sketches ,COMMA polaroids mug shots and line-ups ,COMMA eyewitness testimony can change 
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .PERIOD 
Ron williamson ,COMMA ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club ,COMMA and served 11 years of a death sentence .PERIOD 
Ronald jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman 
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis and more people are being found out 
For example .PERIOD these two show great growth in income .PERIOD absolutely flat .PERIOD happiness curves 
My field ,COMMA the field of psychology hasn't done a whole lot to help us move forward in understanding human happiness .PERIOD 
Emotions are short-lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity 
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves that tune in turn on drop out ,COMMA thoughts ,COMMA perceptions ,COMMA feelings and memories .PERIOD 
We've come away from the freudian gloom ,COMMA and people are now actively studying this .PERIOD 
Absent from this list and absent from any discussions of happiness ,COMMA are happiness in another's happiness 
Babies love the taste of sweet and hate the taste of bitter 
Babies really are born with a lot of innate pleasures 
It turned out that it wasn't that it really is a system of motivation ,COMMA a system of wanting 
There is a profound need to belong .PERIOD 
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA we have three systems that underlie reproduction ,COMMA because it's so important 
There's attachment ,COMMA which is oxytocin .PERIOD and the opiates ,COMMA which says this is a long-term bond 
So a person can be in a long term attachment ,COMMA become romantically infatuated with someone else and want to have sex with a third person .PERIOD 
So if you look at questions like this life satisfaction ,COMMA you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income .PERIOD 
You see mental distress ,COMMA going up with lower income .PERIOD 
But the effect is relatively small 
And sure enough ,COMMA if you look at the kinds of values that come in ,COMMA you see wealth adventure ,COMMA achievement ,COMMA pleasure ,COMMA fun ,COMMA be respected ,COMMA before the change and much more post-materialist values after 
I had all kinds of rats ,COMMA mice ,COMMA hamsters ,COMMA gerbils .PERIOD squirrels .PERIOD 
Growing up in a multicultural environment ,COMMA we had african students in the house ,COMMA and i learned about their stories ,COMMA so different backgrounds ;SEMICOLON dependency on imported know-how ,COMMA goods ,COMMA services ,COMMA exuberant cultural diversity ,COMMA 
Princess ,COMMA diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier to any development ,COMMA which is really true .PERIOD 
And actually our product -- what you see here 
Rats have been used since the '50s last century in all kinds of experiments ,COMMA 
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species ,COMMA 
So in our common language dutch the name ,COMMA for tb 
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .PERIOD 
And by doing so very fast ,COMMA we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive ,COMMA which are negative 
Just as an indication ,COMMA whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day ,COMMA a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes ,COMMA only 
But let's stick first to tuberculosis .PERIOD 
Throughout last year ,COMMA we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .PERIOD 
And there are simple things like ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA to standardize the pellets ,COMMA the food rewards ,COMMA and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people 
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat ,COMMA which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake .PERIOD and so on ,COMMA 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you go about studying the brain 
Now ,COMMA one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti ,COMMA and his colleagues is a group of neurons called mirror neurons ,COMMA which are on the front of the brain ,COMMA in the frontal lobes ,COMMA 
So here is a neuron that fires when i reach and grab something ,COMMA but it also fires .PERIOD when i watch joe reaching and grabbing something 
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action 
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation ,COMMA 
So how do you do imitation ?QUESTIONMARK why is imitation important 
And i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system ,COMMA which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions .PERIOD 
A human being a child can just watch its parent kill .PERIOD another polar bear and skin it and put the skin on its body fur on the body and learn it in one step .PERIOD what the polar bear took 100000 years to learn .PERIOD it can learn in five minutes ,COMMA maybe 10 minutes 
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience 
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .PERIOD 
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers 
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen 
The little hole in the middle ,COMMA we'll come to a bit later ,COMMA but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on a very tiny tube 
So that's 20 micrometers across ,COMMA that pollen grain there 
It's also very biologically active ,COMMA as anyone with hay fever will understand .PERIOD 
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species ,COMMA 
Again -- this time ,COMMA sycamore -- wind-dispersed ,COMMA 
Cool pollen though ,COMMA 
Remember that thing is just about 30 micrometers across ,COMMA 
Now it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding 
The pollen has little barbs on it .PERIOD if we look 
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized this pollen 
Isn't that cool 
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics 
So not only does each type of pollen look different ,COMMA but each habitat has a different combination of plants .PERIOD 
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt ,COMMA similar to the one that i'm wearing .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
And that is the 40 years that women have advocated 
We have effective therapies now 
Why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease 
So in the wise 15 years ago ,COMMA we started out and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA wow ,COMMA there's a couple of key observations ,COMMA and we should probably follow up on that 
Had recently published that when women have heart attacks and die ,COMMA compared to men who have heart attacks and die -- and again ,COMMA this is millions of people happening every day -- women in their fatty plaque -- and this is their coronary artery ,COMMA so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle -- women erode ,COMMA men explode 
Ekg goes pbbrrhh .PERIOD so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg 
So ,COMMA what do you think happens to these gals ?QUESTIONMARK 
So unlike the cat scans x-rays ,COMMA thalliums for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart .PERIOD every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation .PERIOD we say ,COMMA do we really need that test 
And those little red boxes are deaths 
One of the things that we say about all of this female physiology -- because again ,COMMA as much as we're talking about women and heart disease ,COMMA women do on average ,COMMA have better longevity than men -- is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and women 
So we're 35 years behind 
Women participate 
Deb roy ,COMMA this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house ,COMMA if you looked up ,COMMA you'd see a camera and a microphone .PERIOD and if you looked down ,COMMA you'd get this bird's-eye view of the room 
This is my wife and i cooking ,COMMA breakfast in the kitchen ,COMMA and as we move through space and through time a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen ,COMMA 
In order to convert this opaque ,COMMA 90000 hours of video into something that we could start to see .PERIOD we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space .PERIOD and through time what we call space-time worms 
No video here ,COMMA so you can focus on the sound .PERIOD the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory ,COMMA gaga to water 
This is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us 
So it appears that all three primary caregivers -- myself ,COMMA my wife and our nanny -- were systematically and i would think ,COMMA subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language .PERIOD 
What about the visual context 
And there's our nanny by the door ,COMMA 
And what we've done is use the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity 
Three of the key people in this project ,COMMA philip decamp ,COMMA rony ,COMMA kubat and brandon roy are pictured here .PERIOD 
Each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content 
We call this a co-viewing clique ,COMMA a virtual living room if you will 
And there are fascinating dynamics at play 
So this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together 
Come here 
Oh boy 
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry ,COMMA just the simplest of shapes 
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is 
You'd be activating the dorsal stream .PERIOD if you did that 
And it's the part that feels 
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information 
We make meaning by seeing by an act of visual interrogation ,COMMA 
This is a time-lapse view of it 
And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background ,COMMA to make the invisible visible .PERIOD 
You can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows -- certainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill .PERIOD 
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars .PERIOD 
Then looking up in the turret ,COMMA you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth .PERIOD 
Then on the can it says ,COMMA this is the famous budweiser beer .PERIOD we know of no other beer ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA blah ,COMMA 
This little house here ,COMMA those branches there are made out of bois d'arc or osage orange .PERIOD and these pictures will keep scrolling as i talk a little bit 
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones 
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features 
On the one hand ,COMMA we have an apollonian perspective ,COMMA which is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized and perfect 
The dionysian personality takes the picture and goes 
Oops ,COMMA scratch dumpster .PERIOD 
And here's a story ,COMMA jim tulles .PERIOD one of the guys i trained .PERIOD i said ,COMMA jim .PERIOD it's time .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
Jim now it's time you're the down .PERIOD oh ,COMMA 
Good call tulles from now ,COMMA on you guys hit this pile ,COMMA first ,COMMA 
But once in a while ,COMMA you get access to the control room ,COMMA and then you can kind of mess with the dials 
How disgusting 
It's a pretty quick read 
But as soon as you walk in ,COMMA i go ,COMMA ooh spaghetti sauce there 
I feel that expectation .PERIOD and so i accommodate it ,COMMA and i'm living my life according to what you expect me to do 
Wildebeests ,COMMA don't hang with lions ,COMMA because lions eat wildebeests 
And so you see this in junior high ,COMMA a lot 
On the bottom ,COMMA tier we have basic needs -- shelter ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA food ,COMMA water ,COMMA mating and so forth .PERIOD 
We can't even afford to eat anything ,COMMA except beans ,COMMA 
We're in trouble 
And it raises an existential question ,COMMA which is ,COMMA if i'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness ?QUESTIONMARK why am i not visible in the photograph ?QUESTIONMARK and where is this time and place 
This is a police photo .PERIOD that's actually my car 
I'm put on full life support ,COMMA and i have a massive stroke ,COMMA and my brain drops into a coma .PERIOD 
And this is how we began 
Now ,COMMA you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india in madhya pradesh ,COMMA there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art ,COMMA found 
While i was producing in los angeles ,COMMA i never thought about it for a second 
Here's my brain 
And this person is particularly interesting 
The craniomandibular system is critical to that 
If that sounds like a very ,COMMA very strange thing to say ,COMMA and rather a bold statement -- how can the jaw affect the entire body -- let me simply point out to you ?QUESTIONMARK if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk .PERIOD how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand 
That tiny misalignment .PERIOD 
Bear in mind ,COMMA there are no nerves in the teeth .PERIOD 
That's why the same between the before ,COMMA and after that ,COMMA this shows it's hard to see the difference 
This is an mri mra mrv a volumetric mri 
I've brought with me from southern california .PERIOD the fm device 
And when i came out of my coma ,COMMA i recognized my family ,COMMA but i didn't remember my own past 
And i whispered the good news through my broken jaw ,COMMA which was wired shut to my night .PERIOD nurse ,COMMA 
And during my time in coma ,COMMA she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix ,COMMA 
You know ,COMMA when i heard simon's -- please sit down ,COMMA i just want to talk to him for a second -- when i read his book ,COMMA i went to la to meet him 
The thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to every treatment he got ,COMMA every near-miss he had and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations 
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg ,COMMA 
Because the chimpanzee would score half right .PERIOD if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey ,COMMA they would be right .PERIOD half of the cases 
I did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine ,COMMA and they are on par with the chimpanzee there 
Well ,COMMA i first discovered that the textbook was tintin ,COMMA mainly 
And what do you mean with western world ?QUESTIONMARK i said ,COMMA 
And 1962 ,COMMA there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries ,COMMA and they had small families and long lives 
One dollar 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day ,COMMA 
There's a little hump here .PERIOD but there are people all the way 
We heard it in other forms ,COMMA and who are these 
Where are the different countries ?QUESTIONMARK i can show you africa 
The problem in the world was the poverty in asia .PERIOD and if i now let the world move forward ,COMMA you will see that ,COMMA while population increase ,COMMA there are hundreds of millions in asia ,COMMA getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty .PERIOD and this is the pattern we have today .PERIOD 
I can go here ,COMMA and i can split sub-saharan africa into its countries .PERIOD 
And when it burst ,COMMA the size of its country bubble is the size of the population ,COMMA 
Today we don't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america .PERIOD 
The richest 20 percent of ugandans are there 
And we started to write software ,COMMA which could link the data like this 
So i first went to copenhagen because i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA maybe i could become a biochemist ,COMMA but i discovered biochemistry was very boring .PERIOD 
But wilkins ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thought dna was the best bet .PERIOD and he showed this x-ray photograph 
And there i met francis crick 
I went there without knowing him ,COMMA he was 35 .PERIOD i was 23 
And within a day ,COMMA we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna 
And the reason for doing so at the center of this photograph is linus pauling about six months before he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins and in doing .PERIOD so he banished the man out on the right ,COMMA sir lawrence bragg ,COMMA who was the cavendish professor 
This is a photograph several years later ,COMMA when bragg had cause to smile ,COMMA 
And they had the wisdom to say ,COMMA no ,COMMA so he didn't have it 
But there was ones in the literature 
So this was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA unexpected from the world's -- -- and so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups 
And a month after we got the pauling manuscript -- i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people 
Well ,COMMA we got the answer on the 28th ,COMMA february '53 
So i changed the locations and then we found the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions ,COMMA 
So we saw how genetic information is carried 
It didn't yield .PERIOD it didn't give good x-ray photographs 
It was really ,COMMA you know ,COMMA sort of a shitty time .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA at that time -- i should go back 
And then they learned how to read the letters for the code 
There's a chip there a conventional one .PERIOD then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen ,COMMA which is way ahead of affymetrix 
And we use their technique 
Which is all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one 
Actually it's a really big idea .PERIOD 
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives ,COMMA usually in this iron lung to breathe for them 
And it happened so fast in the united states .PERIOD however ,COMMA that even just last month ,COMMA jon stewart said this .PERIOD jon stewart .PERIOD where is polio still active .PERIOD 
They had come from thousands of miles away ,COMMA 
It doesn't survive in the environment ,COMMA hardly at all 
And we've got pretty good vaccines as i've just showed you 
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after 
So it was a massive effort 
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history 
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple 
Now ,COMMA it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years ,COMMA much longer than it should have -- but once it was built .PERIOD the results were striking 
Last year it was 1000 
We should abandon this idea of eradication ,COMMA 
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough .PERIOD 
Umar was paralyzed for life .PERIOD 
As you probably can't see the detail here ,COMMA but this is his report card .PERIOD and you'll see ,COMMA he's got perfect scores .PERIOD 
But you know ,COMMA i'd love to be able to tell you that .PERIOD umar is a typical kid with polio these days ,COMMA but it's not true 
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had ,COMMA and we immediately started using this 
Well ,COMMA in a couple of months ,COMMA we had to get it out of production 
And we didn't start with the easy places 
So this morning ,COMMA at about seven o'clock ,COMMA i decided that we'd try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again ,COMMA so that you could see something that's just unfolding today ,COMMA which proves that the impossible is possible 
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history ,COMMA not a single child has been paralyzed in uttar pradesh or bihar 
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .PERIOD 
Beverly joubert :COLON we are truly passionate about the african wilderness and protecting the african wilderness .PERIOD and so what we've done is we've focused on iconic cats 
But one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have 
Well ,COMMA we needn't have worried 
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves ,COMMA by going where no sane person should go -- not without some prompting ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA from beverly -- and just pushing the envelope ,COMMA going out there ,COMMA pushing our vehicle ,COMMA pushing ourselves ,COMMA 
We don't always get that right .PERIOD and on this particular day ,COMMA we seriously underestimated ,COMMA the depth 
But that's i think what this is all about is that these individuals have these personalities and characters 
Sleep deprivation is extreme 
But for 10 years ,COMMA we tried to capture lions and elephants together -- and never ever managed until this particular night ,COMMA 
This elephant against overwhelming odds ,COMMA simply gives up hope 
But by the same token ,COMMA you can get your hope back again .PERIOD 
Beverly sits on ,COMMA the one side ,COMMA where all her camera gear is ,COMMA and i'm on the other side where my space is 
These are precious to us .PERIOD these divides 
But when this little cub saw that i had vacated my seat and climbed to the back to get some camera gear ,COMMA she came in like a curious cat to come and investigate ,COMMA 
And of course we knew now that she was going to survive 
It was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety protecting it from the hyena 
But i have to tell you -- everybody always asks what happened to the baby baboon 
We had to deal with these individual personalities 
There's an immense amount of poaching as well ,COMMA and so possibly the same amount 
Richard feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories -- experimental predictions -- to specifying the width of north america to within one hair's breadth of accuracy ,COMMA 
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium ,COMMA and the next atom is in the next sports stadium 
As an evolutionary biologist ,COMMA i'd say this our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude of size and speed which our bodies operate at .PERIOD we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms 
Moving to the other end of the scale ,COMMA our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos at speeds close to the speed of light .PERIOD if they had our brains would be much better at understanding einstein .PERIOD i want to give the name middle world to the medium-scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act -- nothing to do with middle earth .PERIOD 
He stared at his wall in arlington virginia ,COMMA and decided to do it 
Then general stubblebine banged .PERIOD his nose hard on the wall of his office stubblebine who commanded 16000 soldiers was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall .PERIOD 
I have every reason to think it's true .PERIOD i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it 
And that's because in middle world ,COMMA air friction is always there 
We have this tendency to think that only solid material things are really things at all waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal .PERIOD 
Steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA you really were there at the time ,COMMA weren't you 
Not a single atom that is in your body today was there .PERIOD when that event took place matter flows from place to place and momentarily comes together to be you 
So really ,COMMA isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence .PERIOD 
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input .PERIOD the current variables to its model while the swallow uses light is incidental .PERIOD 
Haldane guesses :COLON that a dog would probably be able to place the acids in the order of their molecular weights by their smells ,COMMA just as a man could place a number of piano wires in the order of their lengths by means of their notes .PERIOD 
We're blind to all frequencies outside that unless we use instruments to help us 
One way to think about that is by counting planets ,COMMA 
In short ,COMMA when we're thinking like academics ,COMMA we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines like computers or cars ,COMMA but when we revert to being human ,COMMA we behave more like .PERIOD basil fawlty who we remember ,COMMA thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night .PERIOD 
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans .PERIOD it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like basil fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole 
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics 
Now :COLON cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water ,COMMA as you can see there 
So what excites me about cymatics 
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world 
We can also use cymatics for healing and education 
This image here is created from a snippet of beethoven's ninth symphony playing through a cymatic device .PERIOD 
And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen .PERIOD thank you 
The war in vietnam was raging ,COMMA the civil rights movement was under way and pictures had a powerful influence on me 
I believed the photographers ,COMMA and so did millions of other americans

Narrator ,COMMA a word about galvao ,COMMA a very rare kind of bird native to brazil 
Now ,COMMA most of you have figured out that this was a prank ,COMMA and actually a very ,COMMA very good one 
Because what happens on a social network ,COMMA is you interact with the people that you have chosen to interact with 
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day .PERIOD you can go into trending topics .PERIOD 
Now for me ,COMMA i'm surprised by this ,COMMA because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be 
We're heading to the future of bits ,COMMA where everything is speedy ,COMMA it's weightless 
Here's what i think is going on 
It includes things like the internet cables 
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible ,COMMA and we look at what actually happens .PERIOD we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does 
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent 
Even within wikipedias ,COMMA where we're creating their own content ,COMMA online ,COMMA there's a heavy bias towards the place where a lot of the wikipedia authors are based rather than to the rest of the world .PERIOD 
You probably won't 
This is a team of bloggers from around the world ,COMMA 
But the more that i think about it ,COMMA the more that i think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire .PERIOD if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world 
In this case -- the map of the world at night by nasa -- they're dark ,COMMA literally ,COMMA because of lack of electricity ,COMMA 
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it as it's now the most represented language on the internet ,COMMA 
They put it online for free 
My guess is ,COMMA at least one of them has something interesting to say ,COMMA 
And search is terrific .PERIOD if you know what you're looking for 
She has to know something about what stories are available .PERIOD 
I know amira 
He knows one world ,COMMA and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world ,COMMA both of which he has deep connections to 
And the house that john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is actually also now a chinese restaurant called wok 'n roll on h street in washington ,COMMA 
The short answer is ,COMMA actually ,COMMA they're from japan 
The original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso .PERIOD and he has marched very far indeed ,COMMA because he is sweet ,COMMA he is fried ,COMMA and he is chicken -- all things that americans love 
He's retired deaf and plays ,COMMA a lot of mahjong 
But in china ,COMMA this guy's actually known for war and not chicken .PERIOD 
I like to say chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey ,COMMA if you translate into chinese ,COMMA means tsap sui ,COMMA which ,COMMA if you translate back means odds and ends 
Now back then ,COMMA the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food .PERIOD 
There is west indian chinese food .PERIOD there's jamaican chinese food .PERIOD there is middle eastern chinese food .PERIOD there's mauritian chinese food .PERIOD 
This is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered 
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of illinois ,COMMA right 
It wasn't that ,COMMA so they're like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA let's look at television .PERIOD so they looked at an episode of lost 
Now ,COMMA i don't have a tv ,COMMA which makes me a freak ,COMMA but very productive ,COMMA and -- -- and this episode of lost ,COMMA i understand where the overweight guy has a lucky number ,COMMA which was not a lucky number ,COMMA which was how long they'd been on the island ,COMMA but they looked .PERIOD and the numbers did not match 
This actually ,COMMA is a slip that one of the winners had ,COMMA because the tennessee lottery security officials were like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA no -- like this can't be true .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA so i went and started looking 
It was lunch ,COMMA it was take-out ,COMMA it was sit-down ,COMMA it was buffet .PERIOD it was three weeks ago .PERIOD it was three months ago ,COMMA 
This time i'm going to talk about mental illness .PERIOD 
Not only would it lift ,COMMA but it might never return 
That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot 
So they went to the police ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we know that at the rome railroad station ,COMMA there are all these lost souls wandering around ,COMMA muttering gibberish ,COMMA can you bring one of them to us 
That's not going to do anything terrible to him 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the middle '60s ,COMMA the first antidepressants came out .PERIOD tofranil was the first 
Finally ,COMMA i would schedule -- all my major surgical cases ,COMMA i was scheduling them for 12 ,COMMA one o'clock in the afternoon ,COMMA because i couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock 
And my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place ,COMMA said ,COMMA don't worry chap .PERIOD six weeks .PERIOD you're back in the operating room .PERIOD everything's going to be great .PERIOD 
You've seen this painting by edvard munch .PERIOD the scream ,COMMA every moment was a scream .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA as in all hospitals ,COMMA there was a resident assigned to my case he was 27 years old .PERIOD and he would meet with me two or three times a week 
Any of the results along the spectrum ,COMMA from pretty bad to terrible ,COMMA terrible ,COMMA terrible is going to happen .PERIOD if he does the best he can .PERIOD he will have no further obsessions ,COMMA probably no depression ,COMMA but his affect will be dulled ,COMMA he will never go back to surgery .PERIOD he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children .PERIOD his life will be changed .PERIOD if he has the usual result .PERIOD he will end up like .PERIOD 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' .PERIOD and you know about that just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life .PERIOD 
Plugged me into the wires ,COMMA put me to sleep ,COMMA gave me the muscle relaxant .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA lo and behold ,COMMA by 16 ,COMMA by 17 ,COMMA there were demonstrable differences in the way i felt 
It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and i could think clearly 
My children came back to live with us 
We had two more children after that ,COMMA 
It's been as i said ,COMMA close to 30 years 
Every once in a while i get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional 
And i've always felt guilty about that 
I hope it happens to none of you ,COMMA but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you 
Would you describe that as global citizenship 
I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents 
But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship ,COMMA but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism ,COMMA and how to combine these two 
When you actually look at the motor of the world economy ,COMMA it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries 
Well ,COMMA i think we can persuade people that what is necessary for britain's long-term interests .PERIOD what is necessary for america's long-term interests is proper engagement with the rest of the world and taking the action that is necessary 
And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in africa to work together for common causes .PERIOD then the danger of al qaeda and related groups ,COMMA making progress in africa is very big .PERIOD 
And i wouldn't like anything that is said today ,COMMA to suggest that i am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each individual leader has for their own country .PERIOD 
Where was the early warning systems 
All these things have happened 
Even if as a human being ,COMMA you believe that you can't say that you're elected for britain's interests 
Since then the world has moved forward ,COMMA partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in rwanda ,COMMA partly because of what we saw in bosnia 
The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle ,COMMA which governs the world 
So while i can't automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country in danger ,COMMA i can say that britain is in a position where we're working with other countries .PERIOD so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack is something that is accepted by the whole world .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA and then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests .PERIOD 
America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress 
And god shook his head and said ,COMMA not this year ,COMMA not this decade perhaps not even in your lifetime .PERIOD 
And bill clinton walked away in tears ,COMMA because he had failed to get what he wanted 
So that's kind of a bold statement ,COMMA 
And it's technological ,COMMA so it can do things like microelectronics .PERIOD and maybe photonics do 
And the material looks something like this 
The process of discovery generally is inspired by nature 
They find their way to self-assemble 
And we can store information that's film with water and protein 
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light .PERIOD and so we've made optical fibers 
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap 
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted 
And you see there ,COMMA it gets reintegrated in tissue .PERIOD 
So you have a clock you have protein .PERIOD and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday 
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before 
Some people in the last decade or two have started creating artwork with technology 
You can learn something from the robot about the community that you're in 
You guys are looking good out there 
Data ?QUESTIONMARK here's the first one 
One of them falls to the ground ,COMMA 
I can help 
You've been a great audience 
There's a lot more to come 
Then he said ,COMMA but really sarah ,COMMA you could have worked harder .PERIOD can't you see ?QUESTIONMARK it's really too small 
Indeed ,COMMA it's rather small 
One day ,COMMA while my father was working on a file for us to obtain french nationality ,COMMA i happened to see some documents that caught my attention 
These are real 
So his story ,COMMA my father was born in argentina 
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry ,COMMA because it was the only consolation for his sadness ,COMMA 
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .PERIOD 
But it was he who went to meet a man from the resistance 
In those times documents had hard covers ,COMMA they were filled in by hand .PERIOD and they stated your job 
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials ,COMMA he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel 
Time passed ,COMMA and they thought he had surely forgotten them at first 
And then i understood that asking my father ,COMMA so many questions was stirring up a whole past .PERIOD he probably didn't feel like talking about ,COMMA because it was painful 
In africa ,COMMA there were countries fighting for their independence .PERIOD guinea .PERIOD guinea-bissau angola :COLON 
There was also latin america .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA no 
We live on a human-dominated planet ,COMMA putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on earth 
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity in the global phase of sustainability 
So i thought i'd bring her with me today on stage to have her as a witness of a remarkable journey ,COMMA which humbly reminds us of the period of grace we've had over the past 10000 years 
Here used as a proxy ,COMMA temperature variability .PERIOD 
It was a jumpy ride .PERIOD 80000 years back in a crisis ,COMMA we leave africa ,COMMA we colonize australia in another crisis .PERIOD 60000 years back ,COMMA we leave asia for europe in another crisis .PERIOD 40000 years back ,COMMA and then we enter the remarkably stable holocene phase .PERIOD the only period in the whole history of the planet that we know of that can support human development 
The majority of the planet ,COMMA aspiring for development ,COMMA having the right for development .PERIOD are in large ,COMMA aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle ,COMMA a momentous pressure .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you would have wished the climate pressure to hit a strong planet ,COMMA a resilient planet .PERIOD but unfortunately ,COMMA the third pressure is the ecosystem decline 
Now if we have evidence ,COMMA which we now have ,COMMA that wetlands ,COMMA forests ,COMMA [unclear] monsoon system ,COMMA the rainforests ,COMMA behave in this nonlinear way .PERIOD 
And could we even thanks to major advancements in earth systems science identify the thresholds ?QUESTIONMARK the points where we may expect nonlinear change 
Now ,COMMA this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries ,COMMA 
In the '60s already ,COMMA through the green revolution ,COMMA and the haber-bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere -- you know ,COMMA human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole 
There's good news here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from latin america ,COMMA where plow-based farming systems of the '50s and '60s ,COMMA led farming basically to a dead-end ,COMMA with lower and lower yields ,COMMA degrading the organic matter and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels in paraguay ,COMMA uruguay ,COMMA and a number of countries brazil leading to innovation and entrepreneurship among farmers in partnership with scientists into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems combined with mulch farming with locally adapted technologies .PERIOD which today ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in some countries have led to a tremendous increase in area under mulch ,COMMA zero till farming ,COMMA which not only produces more food ,COMMA but also sequesters carbon ,COMMA 
It has to basically do this on current land ,COMMA 
Elinor ostrom ,COMMA the latest nobel laureate of economics ,COMMA clearly shows empirically across the world that we can govern the commons .PERIOD if we invest in trust ,COMMA local ,COMMA action-based partnerships and cross-scale institutional innovations ,COMMA where local actors ,COMMA together can deal with the global commons at a large scale .PERIOD 
Where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy ,COMMA but you can subsidize electricity to poor people 
So there is scientific evidence 
I was asked to come here and speak about creation .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA creation is what put that dog in that picture and creativity is what makes us see a chicken .PERIOD on his hindquarters 
And another point -- why i'm here -- is that the day i went to pick up the plexiglas trophy ,COMMA i rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life ,COMMA picked the thing -- didn't have any friends 
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles ,COMMA 
And that's how -- with this money ,COMMA i paid for a ticket to come to the united states in 1983 .PERIOD and that's very -- the basic reason i'm talking to you here today ,COMMA because i got shot 
Unfortunately ,COMMA it has become obsolete because it was designed for atari platform 
But i was still ,COMMA you know -- this is a kitty cloud 
The snail 
And your eye doesn't know which level to read 
And they would look at it -- ah ,COMMA it's a pencil ,COMMA drawing 
It had a physicality ,COMMA and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way towards the image .PERIOD so this is monkey with leica .PERIOD 
And i wanted to deal with other subjects 
I got some photographs from them 
And jackson pollock also ,COMMA 
I used the dust at the whitney museum ,COMMA to render some pieces of their collection .PERIOD 
And i picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity 
They do a dna scan of this ,COMMA they will come up with a great mailing list .PERIOD 
Also the reference to gerhard richter's use of color charts -- and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today ,COMMA which is the bit map 
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking 
On the other hand ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i paid like three dollars ,COMMA i think -- and i went to a warehouse in queens to see a version of othello .PERIOD by an amateur group ,COMMA 
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that 
And the information is there twice -- one on each strand -- which is important ,COMMA because when new cells are formed ,COMMA these strands come apart .PERIOD new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process .PERIOD 
So an interesting question is ,COMMA what happened when we met 
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna ,COMMA how you convert it to a form ,COMMA you can sequence 
The same is true .PERIOD if we look at a chinese individual ,COMMA versus an african ,COMMA the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often 
And further back 800000 years ago ,COMMA is there a common origin with present day humans 
But we do find it in papua ,COMMA new guinea ,COMMA and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific 
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were .PERIOD but we know that in southern siberia ,COMMA there were both neanderthals and denisovans ,COMMA at least at some time in the past 
And since we mixed elsewhere ,COMMA i'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms in africa ,COMMA we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa 
And if i were to write a volume ,COMMA it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions ,COMMA because my work in understanding art ,COMMA and in understanding culture has come by following artists ,COMMA by looking at what artists mean ,COMMA and what they do and who they are 
My overall project is about art -- specifically about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves 
What that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment ,COMMA the me ,COMMA we seems incredibly prescient totally important .PERIOD 
To this end ,COMMA the specific project that has made this possible .PERIOD for me is a series of exhibitions ,COMMA all titled ,COMMA with an f -- freestyle ,COMMA frequency and flow -- which have set out to discover and define the young black artists ,COMMA working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years 
It is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i'm asking 
But really it has been what i've discovered about myself ,COMMA and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves ,COMMA and to talk and speak to each other 
And you put on the t-10 parachute 
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning 
And that's to boost everybody's confidence to show that you're not scared 
Then they give you get ready 
So nice air comes flowing in 
So then you look around ,COMMA you're under a canopy ,COMMA and you say ,COMMA this is good 
In 30-some years of jumping ,COMMA i never did one 
And i realized that if they had to go into combat ,COMMA they would do what we had taught them ,COMMA and they would follow leaders 
So now i do that tuesday morning jump ,COMMA but it's not any jump -- that was september 11th .PERIOD 2001 ,COMMA 
Sort of leadership by humiliation ,COMMA 
I've got to use video teleconferences ,COMMA i've got to use chat ,COMMA i've got to use email i've got to use phone calls -- i've got to use everything i can not just for communication .PERIOD but for leadership 
And that's a new kind of leadership for me 
So we had to get complex intelligence together ,COMMA we had to line up the ability to act 
In reality ,COMMA much of the force .PERIOD i led looked exactly like you 
And so instead of giving orders you're now building consensus .PERIOD and you're building a sense of shared purpose 
It also produced something which i call an inversion of expertise ,COMMA because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot ,COMMA that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore .PERIOD 
And it's a brand new leadership challenge .PERIOD 
And every morning in the ranger regiment ,COMMA every ranger -- and there are more than 2000 of them -- says a six-stanza ranger creed 
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing 
That was my journey 
I came to believe that a leader isn't good ,COMMA because they're right .PERIOD they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust 
Alex steffen :COLON and i founded worldchanging in late 2003 .PERIOD and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions that are out there right now .PERIOD and on the near horizon ,COMMA 
As norwegian social scientist .PERIOD evelin lindner has observed .PERIOD pessimism is a luxury of good times 
In difficult times .PERIOD pessimism is a self-fulfilling ,COMMA self-inflicted death sentence .PERIOD 
Community tools like text messaging that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising ,COMMA or a natural disaster is unfolding .PERIOD can give you the information ,COMMA you need to act in a timely fashion .PERIOD 
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government to the blairwatch project in the uk ,COMMA keeping tabs on politicians ,COMMA who try to avoid the press 
Now imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists ,COMMA 
Imagine a web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet ,COMMA putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds ,COMMA from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures 
Now just to be clear in this talk ,COMMA i'm using the name earth witness as part of the scenario ,COMMA simply as a shorthand for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,COMMA not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the witness organization 
Earth witness would show us two worlds ,COMMA the world we're leaving behind and the world we're building for generations to come 
After this ,COMMA we noticed a couple of interesting things ,COMMA which you'll see 
Make yourself understood to the computer 
And he couldn't travel .PERIOD so i went over there 
And all over india at the end of about two years ,COMMA children were beginning to google their homework 
They said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we did 
So i said ,COMMA for two months ,COMMA you were looking at stuff .PERIOD you didn't understand 
It took me three years to publish that 
I said ,COMMA no use the method of the grandmother 
What is that can you do that again ?QUESTIONMARK can you show me some more' she did that for two months 
The scores went up to 50 ,COMMA which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting 
The first group -- the best one -- solved everything in 20 minutes ,COMMA 
The average score when i'd done it with the computers ,COMMA and the groups was 76 percent 
Back at gateshead ,COMMA a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of hinduism in 15 minutes .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA stuff ,COMMA which i don't know anything about 
This is a sole in newcastle 
I started writing english questions on the blackboard ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA you know what's happened 
Thanks 
I was too young ,COMMA unmarried ,COMMA i had no children .PERIOD didn't really know africa .PERIOD and besides my french was pitiful ,COMMA 
So then i went the whole american way with competitions ,COMMA team and individual ,COMMA completely failed .PERIOD but over time ,COMMA the women learnt to sell on their own way .PERIOD 
So blue blue ,COMMA everything became blue .PERIOD 
I think andrew pretty well covered that so i will move to the third point ,COMMA which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .PERIOD 
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise ,COMMA and both of them ,COMMA because they're manufacturers create jobs directly and create incomes indirectly ,COMMA because they're in the malaria sector ,COMMA and africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria 
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused 
He was actually living in the kibera slums .PERIOD when his father called him and told him about artemisia and the value-add potential .PERIOD 
Samuel's kids are in private school ,COMMA and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into artemisia production -- dignity being more important than wealth .PERIOD 
The next one ,COMMA many of you know ,COMMA 
And so from an enterprise perspective for africa and from a public health perspective ,COMMA these are real successes 
We can start building local distribution ,COMMA and actually it can cost the public sector ,COMMA much less 
One that people will pay different prices ,COMMA but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net and make a decision to buy it 
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us to essentially refuse trite assumptions ,COMMA get out of our ideological boxes 
And we came up with some parameters ,COMMA because you know building ,COMMA a rube goldberg machine has limitations ,COMMA but it also is pretty wide open .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .PERIOD 
Of those 85 takes only three actually successfully completed their run 
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it 
It think we can do better than this .PERIOD hello tedxusc .PERIOD 
Let me start again 
Where it goes in the future is questioned .PERIOD so that's the human part .PERIOD 
And in that 15 percent ,COMMA the main focus is on human mind ,COMMA thinking skills ,COMMA somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school ,COMMA which is putting information and dogma into them ,COMMA get them .PERIOD so they really think ask tough questions ,COMMA argue about serious subjects .PERIOD don't believe everything that's in the book ,COMMA think broadly or creative ,COMMA they can be 
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail 
This was the full size of the original creature ,COMMA 
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator 
Buckminster fuller said it clearly ,COMMA there are no passengers on spaceship earth ,COMMA only crew ,COMMA we the crew ,COMMA can ,COMMA and must do more with less -- much less 
It's amazing .PERIOD just on the puny power of the sun -- by having a super lightweight plane ,COMMA you're able to get it up there 
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you 
But there's a lot of technology going 
Sorry 
It never makes a mistake .PERIOD because if you make a mistake ,COMMA you don't leave any progeny 
In concluding ,COMMA i want to get back to the big picture ,COMMA and i have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective .PERIOD 
And so i just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there ,COMMA but you can fill in whatever you want .PERIOD this is not a forecast .PERIOD 
Last night we gave it a few too many turns ,COMMA and it tried to bash the roof out .PERIOD also .PERIOD it's about a gram .PERIOD 
Thank you 
And despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals 
But inevitably ,COMMA these tumors progress towards being enormous ,COMMA ulcerating tumors like this one here 
They were too young to survive without their mother .PERIOD 
Scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer ,COMMA this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population 
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only 14 
Paradoxically ,COMMA once established natural selection actually favors ,COMMA the continued growth of cancer 
So cancer could be thought of as a strange ,COMMA short-lived ,COMMA self-destructive life form -- an evolutionary dead end 
In fact ,COMMA more genetic profiling told us that this tumor in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil -- and jonas was clearly a male 
So how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas' face 
Well ,COMMA the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania 
They tend to bite each other ,COMMA often quite ferociously and usually on the face .PERIOD 
But if this can happen in tasmanian devils ,COMMA why hasn't it happened in other animals ,COMMA or even humans ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA the answer is it has 
She took him to the vet ,COMMA and the vet discovered something quite disgusting 
So we've seen that this can happen in animals 
Ad he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else .PERIOD 
Most of the people that dr .PERIOD southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells 
And i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future 
Why has the record been so poor 
Because after years of stagnation and decline ,COMMA the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
The security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers who build the security 
It does increase security 
One is jobs 
Now that is difficult 
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms 
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts donors know ,COMMA that's not a realistic agenda .PERIOD and so what they also do is the total bypass ,COMMA just fund ngos 
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three 
So they wouldn't be provided .PERIOD thanks to the united states ,COMMA government and some ngo 
And basically what i'd like to tell you is that power is changing .PERIOD and there are two types of changes .PERIOD i want to discuss 
What we're going to see in the 21st century is asia ,COMMA gradually ,COMMA returning to being more than half of the world's population ,COMMA and more than half of the world's product 
It's not just prevailing at war ,COMMA though ,COMMA war still persists .PERIOD 
If we try to focus on the reality ,COMMA then what we need to focus on is what's really happening in terms of china and the united states 
And that the chinese won't catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part .PERIOD after 2050 of this century ,COMMA 
Why does it matter who cares 
The answer is ,COMMA it matters quite a lot 
So empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody .PERIOD and it's not a zero sum .PERIOD i win ,COMMA you lose 
How do we define our national interests ,COMMA so that it's not just zero sum ,COMMA but positive sum 
The world has a new mania 
A mania for learning english 
T ,COMMA i don't want to let myself down 
T ,COMMA perfect .PERIOD s .PERIOD perfect 
S ,COMMA i want to change my life 
So is english mania good or bad 
And now english is becoming the language of problem-solving ,COMMA 
It's a true feeling 
Why is this old table in your office 
And as i grew up ,COMMA i heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table ,COMMA i began to call it the wisdom table 
And i was so shocked ,COMMA so stunned ,COMMA i got up and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD but what do i do 
And that question cleared the space 
This film is called world peace and other 4th :COLON grade achievements 
And it's a beautiful thing 
And i saw miss ethel j banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day 
And i'm not even talking about you behind me ,COMMA because i've got eyes in the back of my head 
And really ,COMMA i feel as though when i see the film -- i have a gesture she does like this -- i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture ,COMMA 
And so this world peace game ,COMMA i'd like to tell you about 
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading 
I offer them the job ,COMMA they can turn it down ,COMMA and then they choose their own cabinet .PERIOD 
That's not all 
I throw them into this complex matrix ,COMMA and they trust me ,COMMA because we have a deep rich relationship together 
There's oil spills ;SEMICOLON environmental disasters ,COMMA water rights disputes ;SEMICOLON breakaway republics .PERIOD famine .PERIOD endangered species and global warming 
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever .PERIOD once they start playing 
And because i don't know they've got to dig up the answer 
My question to you is ,COMMA who's in charge of that classroom 
And we were very upset 
I could not have designed that in teaching it 
It'll be more realer if she reads it 
We have a lot of data ,COMMA but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what's going on 
And there are three seconds left on the clock 
I joined telco made tata trucks ,COMMA pretty close to pune ,COMMA 
So i took one year off ,COMMA and i went to this village science program 
This square might look very square and prim 
But give a child a triangle ,COMMA he can't do a thing to it .PERIOD 
They always make a triangular roof 
Now this is people science 
The insects are eaten by the frogs .PERIOD the frogs are eaten by the snakes .PERIOD the snakes are eaten by the eagles .PERIOD 
And you put a little fan here 
And this is a hundred-year-old toy 
I just put this inside this 
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this 
This is an old bicycle tube ,COMMA which gives you a broad rubber band ,COMMA two safety pins 
It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin ,COMMA 
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic ,COMMA aluminum -- which are are sealed together .PERIOD 
I'm going to keep this outside to blow out .PERIOD i'm going to suck in air 
Well ,COMMA before i go any further ,COMMA this is something worth sharing 
If i crank the handle ,COMMA all the wool goes inside ,COMMA 
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .PERIOD 
When first you see nehru and gandhi ,COMMA this is the nehru cap -- just half a newspaper 
And the second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold 
And there's a third one over here ,COMMA 
Firstly ,COMMA radical increases in resource efficiency 
And for all three of these ,COMMA i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need 
And i'm just going to talk through this animation 
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time ,COMMA there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing 
And the kind of elements i'm talking about are ,COMMA firstly ,COMMA we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA when julius caesar arrived in north africa ,COMMA huge areas of north .PERIOD africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests 
The converse is also true .PERIOD 
The more vegetation we lose ,COMMA the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change .PERIOD and lead to further ,COMMA desertification 
The way it does this is it comes out at night ,COMMA crawls to the top of a sand dune .PERIOD and because it's got a matte black shell ,COMMA is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .PERIOD 
And the ingenuity if you could call it ,COMMA that goes even further .PERIOD 
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water 
We're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse 
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions ,COMMA and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills ,COMMA and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through ,COMMA it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process 
And what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside 
And when you think about nature ,COMMA often you think about it as being all about competition 
You think what can i add to the system to create more value ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages .PERIOD 
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine 
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits ,COMMA and capture the salts ,COMMA transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity .PERIOD 
Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language 
And this is an important point 
There are very few doctors and quite frankly ,COMMA these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics 
Very simple 
And knowing that starts to explain a lot of long-standing mysteries in science ,COMMA 
It also brings up new issues ,COMMA though ,COMMA like computational irreducibility .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA in working on this science for many years ,COMMA i kept wondering what will be its first killer app 
Let's start off with something really easy .PERIOD 
And it should be able to tell us that 
Let's say the revenue of microsoft 
Well ,COMMA even starting from mathematica ,COMMA this is still a huge amount of work 
Well ,COMMA a crucial idea of wolfram alpha is that you can just ask it questions ,COMMA using ordinary human language ,COMMA which means that we've got to be able to take all those strange utterances that people type into the input field and understand them 
And i must say that i thought that step might just be plain impossible 
Right now ,COMMA if we look at web queries ,COMMA more than 80 percent of them ,COMMA get handled successfully .PERIOD the first time 
And when one does that one really changes the economics of delivering computational things ,COMMA whether it's on the web or elsewhere ,COMMA 
I'll show you one example here 
Something like rule 30 ,COMMA for example ,COMMA turns out to be a really good randomness generator 
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe 
But in at least a large class of cases ,COMMA one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network ,COMMA which when it gets big enough ,COMMA behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave ,COMMA like a continuous fluid .PERIOD 
Actually i haven't shown these before ,COMMA but here are a few of the candidate universes that i've looked at 
Benoit mandelbrot is in the audience .PERIOD 
We've questioned the future of capitalism 
And the idea is a simple simple idea ,COMMA which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action .PERIOD 
The consumer is empowered 
Do you know what this was right here 
And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually stepping forth ,COMMA and basically leveraging future education ,COMMA future children in our households 
However ,COMMA consumers have moved 
Dentists report molars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people grinding their teeth ,COMMA coming in and reporting the fact that they've had stress 
But seriously what we see happening ,COMMA and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat ,COMMA is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer ,COMMA who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out 
We see high-end haggling in fashion today ,COMMA 
So from a value and values standpoint ,COMMA what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways .PERIOD 
Gore-tex ,COMMA is ,COMMA all about personal accountability of their management and their employees to the point where they really kind of shun .PERIOD the idea of bosses ,COMMA 
The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living 
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners 
Let's look at a couple of quick examples 
You need to harness it ,COMMA you need to give it meaning 
This kogi doesn't exist .PERIOD it's a moving truck right 
Or you look at johnson &amp ;SEMICOLON johnson's momversations 
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it 
But at the same time ,COMMA this is also a tremendous opportunity 
So i decided to investigate 
So i'm going to challenge all of you 
We talk about world peace 
And i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands ,COMMA great mothers ,COMMA friends ,COMMA daughters ,COMMA sons ,COMMA 
That's what i do in life -- telling stories ,COMMA writing novels -- and today ,COMMA i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .PERIOD 
I was born in strasbourg france to turkish parents 
In response ,COMMA she said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA praying is effective ,COMMA but also beware of the power of circles 
We all do 
Our friends ,COMMA neighbors ,COMMA colleagues family -- if all the people in our inner circle resemble us ,COMMA it means we are surrounded with our mirror image .PERIOD 
Instead it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen -- not as an individual on his own ,COMMA but as the representative of something larger 
I came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country .PERIOD politics ,COMMA cigarettes and the veil ,COMMA 
I lived in a very vibrant ,COMMA diverse neighborhood ,COMMA where i wrote several of my novels 
What i experienced as a child in that school ,COMMA in madrid ,COMMA is happening in the literary world today ,COMMA 
Meanwhile ,COMMA the other leg draws a wide circle .PERIOD constantly moving 
We see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn ,COMMA who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness 
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all 
You see there ,COMMA it's about 620 billion a year 
R&ampd in total in the economy ,COMMA publicly ,COMMA funded is about 06 percent of gdp 
The first thing i want to say ,COMMA and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system ,COMMA and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful ,COMMA 
So tiny moon 
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself .PERIOD but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .PERIOD 
And what's important about that is that on our planet on earth ,COMMA wherever we find liquid water ,COMMA we find life 
Tremendous and beautiful discovery 
And they saw strange pictures like this 
It's called helios -- helios from the sun ,COMMA 
That's a type ia supernova explosion 
It sits there about say ,COMMA 13 times the mass of the sun 
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics ,COMMA because we understand that process ,COMMA because we understand the structure of atoms here on earth .PERIOD 
And if i blow it up there ,COMMA you see it 
But it visited jupiter ;SEMICOLON saturn .PERIOD uranus and neptune .PERIOD 
You could have made it in the 1890s .PERIOD you wouldn't have the transistor 
Let me leave the last words to someone who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine humphrey davy who did his science at the turn of the 19th century 
Thank you 
Streets have names .PERIOD blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets 
They say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's block 17 .PERIOD and this is block .PERIOD 16 
Just look at google maps here .PERIOD there's block .PERIOD 14 15 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 17 .PERIOD 18 .PERIOD 19 ,COMMA 
You say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but walking around the neighborhood ,COMMA i noticed that the house numbers don't go in order 
It's a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking ,COMMA and it is very big business .PERIOD 
Our daughter ,COMMA then joined us at the breakfast table ,COMMA and i asked her is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school .PERIOD 
I go to work ,COMMA i check email i log onto a few more social sites .PERIOD i blog .PERIOD i check more news reports .PERIOD i share some of those news reports .PERIOD i go .PERIOD look at some videos ,COMMA pretty typical day -- in this case ,COMMA actually fairly pedantic -- and at the end of the day ,COMMA as my day winds down ,COMMA look at my profile .PERIOD 
And i’d say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i’m walking for the environment .PERIOD 
I called my parents up 
And so i did 
It’s only 500 miles 
I had written the university of montana two years earlier and said ,COMMA i'd like to go to school there 
But i use that story ,COMMA because they really wanted to help me 
I had 13 students when i first walked into the class 
I could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out 
They had to take that class with me 
And on earth ,COMMA day 1990 -- the 20th anniversary of earth day -- that’s when i began to speak 
I got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and walked through all of the islands and to venezuela ,COMMA 
And i got to -- i start saying free at last -- thank god .PERIOD almighty ,COMMA i’m free at last 
I had no idea ,COMMA i was going to become a un ambassador 
I was going to have to change 
I know i needed to change ,COMMA because it would be the only way that i could be here today 
When does learning begin 
Well today ,COMMA i want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible ,COMMA but which is supported by the latest evidence ,COMMA from psychology and biology ,COMMA 
Now i'm a science reporter 
I write books and magazine .PERIOD articles 
The flavors of the food ,COMMA a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid ,COMMA which is continuously swallowed by the fetus 
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat 
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular ,COMMA provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind 
The hunger winter as it came to be known killed .PERIOD some 10000 people and weakened thousands more 
Learning is one of life's most essential activities ,COMMA and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined 
You'd still have five billion left in change .PERIOD and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down 
Now years ,COMMA after you remember the strategic question of whether you're flying in a 777 or an airbus ,COMMA you remember those words ,COMMA and that experience 
I mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane 
I spoke about this before ,COMMA and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said ,COMMA okay .PERIOD what can you do 
One of them also being ,COMMA although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it .PERIOD if it only serves two floors ,COMMA it's actually bloody terrifying .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
They said ,COMMA can we do an advertising campaign 
I said ,COMMA it's really really easy 
Now interesting that no single person does that ,COMMA or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it 
Moving over we come of course ,COMMA to consultancy ,COMMA 
I mean tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model 
That's why i call for the chief detail officer .PERIOD 
But as i was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression .PERIOD i realized that with today's technological resources ,COMMA there's no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument 
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .PERIOD 
And i also was taught coupled with that that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job ,COMMA apparently to help 
This is what jesus asked of us 
That was news to me ,COMMA and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in 
And i felt overwhelmed 
And i didn't know what would happen when i ran out of things to give ,COMMA especially if the problem was never going away 
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor 
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth ,COMMA because i wasn't doing more apparently to make things better 
It became a transaction for me ,COMMA became sort of a trade 
So i spent three months in kenya ,COMMA uganda and tanzania ,COMMA interviewing entrepreneurs .PERIOD that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business 
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .PERIOD 
But there were these beautiful details ,COMMA even if i talked to 20 goat herders in a row and some days .PERIOD that's what happened -- these beautiful details of life ,COMMA change that were meaningful to them 
I never once was asked for a donation ,COMMA which had kind of been my mode ,COMMA right 
We sent it over to uganda 
When you lend them money and they slowly pay you back over time ,COMMA you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue 
So the mapping of participating in the story ,COMMA it actually flows with the up and down 
We make it really ,COMMA really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site 
But the good news is ,COMMA i don't think i need to stand here and convince you to care -- i'm not even going to try 
And i'm grateful that whenever i do that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA i am inspired -- i am inspired by the person .PERIOD i am listening to 
What is the future of the human race 
If not what created the universe 
First there were the laws like maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe ,COMMA given its state over all of space at one time ,COMMA 
However ,COMMA this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge 
Professor hawking .PERIOD thank you for that answer .PERIOD 
I'm a geologist by training ,COMMA but i love that 
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice .PERIOD and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in makes them .PERIOD look just like algae 
That's an amazing thing 
And an octopus ain't that amazing now .PERIOD roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink .PERIOD and when he lands the octopus says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i've been seen 
And now he's gone .PERIOD and so am i ?QUESTIONMARK thank you very much .PERIOD 
That's the lucy species ,COMMA and was found .PERIOD by my research team in december of 2000 ,COMMA in an area called dikika ,COMMA 
It's in the northeastern part of ethiopia ,COMMA 
You don't just jump into an invitation 
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes .PERIOD that are 35000 years old .PERIOD 
When you get there ,COMMA this is what you see .PERIOD and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable .PERIOD 
You find elephants rhinos ,COMMA monkeys ;SEMICOLON pigs ;SEMICOLON etc .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA another one that's a monkey .PERIOD that's a pig ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Here is a close-up of the fossil after five years of cleaning ,COMMA preparation and description ,COMMA which was very long .PERIOD and i had to expose the bones from the sandstone block .PERIOD i just showed you in the previous slide .PERIOD 
So then once you've done that the next stage is to know what it is 
You don't see that in chimpanzees ,COMMA and you don't see this very projecting canine 
And how old was she when she died 
That's why we need care from our parents 
So by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history ,COMMA selam unites us all ,COMMA and gives us a unique account on what makes us human 
Up to now the knowledge that we had about ,COMMA our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals ,COMMA because the fossils ,COMMA the baby fossils were missing 
Imagine somebody coming from mars ,COMMA and his job is to report on the type of people occupying our planet earth ,COMMA and you hide all the babies ,COMMA the children ,COMMA and he goes back and reports 
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy ,COMMA but they did great 
With an average depth of the oceans of 4000 meters ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the high seas covers ,COMMA and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life .PERIOD on this earth ,COMMA 
It is ,COMMA in theory ,COMMA the global commons ,COMMA belonging to us .PERIOD all 
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker ,COMMA blue 
And of course ,COMMA if you want people to play by the rules ,COMMA you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement ,COMMA for as we've discovered ,COMMA you can trust ,COMMA but you also need to verify 
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from northern european .PERIOD and northern american rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in stockholm and five showed up in the uk .PERIOD just recently ,COMMA 
It's actually a bay 
Coming closer to here ,COMMA the costa rica dome is a recently ,COMMA discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales ,COMMA 
That is ,COMMA it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative .PERIOD 
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the world heritage convention ,COMMA so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these world heritage sites ,COMMA or we need to change the name and call it half-the-world heritage convention 
What i find so exciting is that the census of marine life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators .PERIOD it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column ,COMMA where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found 
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots ,COMMA hotspots 
But not all the vessels have those to date 
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect ,COMMA 
So here we are seven years .PERIOD 500 interviews later ,COMMA and i'm gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick .PERIOD 
And the first thing i say to them is ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA you can't serve yourself .PERIOD you gotta serve others ,COMMA something of value 
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought ,COMMA i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring 
But today ,COMMA we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely ,COMMA years after we're gone 
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones ,COMMA complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post .PERIOD after you die 
But what i think comes next is far more interesting 
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here 
Taking it a step further ,COMMA mit's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans ,COMMA 
It's not that it's not possible to feed ,COMMA clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .PERIOD 
And that's what will happen to us .PERIOD 
I accept where we are 
The future is inherently uncertain .PERIOD 
Imagine our highly-tuned ,COMMA just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .PERIOD 
If we feel it now ,COMMA and think it through ,COMMA we will realize we have nothing to fear ,COMMA but fear itself .PERIOD 
We can do this 
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do 
We have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food .PERIOD some 10000 years ago ,COMMA 
We've built a powerful foundation of science ,COMMA knowledge and technology -- more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent ,COMMA meaningful and satisfying lives .PERIOD 
We can choose this moment of crisis to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution -- like what do we want to be when we grow up when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality 
We can choose life over fear 
And one more thing archie was suffering from this illness himself 
So the situation seemed pretty desperate 
He gives half of them vitamin b12 
So cochrane then goes to the germans who are running the prison camp 
And he can't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated .PERIOD and he vents his frustrations 
So the symptoms of the complex are no matter how complicated the problem you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .PERIOD 
You could count them in five minutes 
What is evolution 
How do you do it 
It falls to the floor ,COMMA 
You make lots of money 
Ten percent of americans don't disappear every year 
I sometimes wonder 
Now i've been sort of banging on about this for the last couple of months ,COMMA and people sometimes say to me ,COMMA well ,COMMA tim ,COMMA it's kind of obvious 
And there's an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher's desk ,COMMA who knows all the answers 
When schools stop doing that all the time i will admit that yes ,COMMA it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .PERIOD 
Until then ,COMMA until then i'm going to keep banging on about trial and error and why we should abandon the god complex 
They had the god complex in spades .PERIOD 
And after the trial had been running for a little while he gathered together ,COMMA all his colleagues around his table .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA we have some preliminary results 
Shut it down at once ,COMMA 
Tumbleweed rolls through the meeting room 
It isn't easy 
So shortly after the war ,COMMA this young man ,COMMA yutaka taniyama developed this amazing conjecture called the taniyama-shimura conjecture 
In fact ,COMMA it turns out it's equivalent to proving fermat's last theorem .PERIOD 
You prove one you prove the other 
And the problem with leverage is it makes the us financial system .PERIOD look like this 
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over 
And as you think about that ,COMMA you've got to wonder ,COMMA so what do banks have in store for you now ,COMMA 
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here ,COMMA a trillion there that we've brought that date of reckoning forward to about 2017 
We're going to start to pay them 
This guy runs the china .PERIOD investment corporation .PERIOD 
This is an actual bill 
If you look at the federal budget ,COMMA this is what it looks like 
Everything else is mandated 
That's the short term .PERIOD that's the flame part .PERIOD 
Among other things ,COMMA because startup companies are 02 percent of us gdp investmentm and they're about 178 percent of output 
Twenty-one countries came together ,COMMA dozens of teams 
Two years ago ,COMMA you saw this creature 
But then ,COMMA if you lose one of those second set of teeth ,COMMA they don't regrow ,COMMA unless if you're a lawyer 
So there are now nine women walking around boston with re-grown bladders ,COMMA which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life .PERIOD 
If you don't have a flat world ,COMMA that's not good ,COMMA which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different 
And this stuff is moving very quickly .PERIOD and by the way that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight 
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you ,COMMA and i can they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and other types of tonal scales ,COMMA 
This is a group in germany ,COMMA that's beginning to engineer eyes .PERIOD so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark 
Very primitive 
They'll do stuff you ,COMMA and i can't do 
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of the origin of species ,COMMA 
Maybe not 
Once upon a time ,COMMA there was a dread disease that afflicted children 
And so as a consequence ,COMMA a few years later ,COMMA another scientist -- perhaps maybe this scientist not quite as brilliant as the one who had preceded him ,COMMA but building on the invention of the first one -- came up with a second cure 
And the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one-year-olds 
And the government they heard her story and the other people ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA you're right .PERIOD we should make a law 
We would lose all of our market 
So many times when you try to do research on data ,COMMA it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data 
And then finally ,COMMA the last set of bars ,COMMA which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash .PERIOD 50 75 100 different characteristics of the crash 
And the other thing you might argue is well ,COMMA car seats have got a lot better over time .PERIOD 
So they just have these bench seats ,COMMA and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA it turns out that those two crashes that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse .PERIOD so he gets about a 500 out of -- you know ,COMMA on this range -- relative to a 400 and something 
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved ,COMMA as a car seat 
It's in 5000 days ,COMMA all this stuff has come 
There's two million emails per second 
It's just a huge machine ,COMMA and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet 
And in some ways ,COMMA it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing .PERIOD 
And i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web 
They're going to talk to the machine 
Now with rfids and other things -- whatever technology it is ,COMMA it doesn't really matter .PERIOD the point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine .PERIOD and so we have basically an internet of things 
But in fact ,COMMA what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two ,COMMA where we embed the information and the digital nature of things into the material world 
Attention is the currency 
And i'm saying humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine ,COMMA in a certain sense ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring ,COMMA that what the web is doing is restructuring 
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this ,COMMA you had to share packets of information 
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line .PERIOD you had to share packets 
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages 
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you ,COMMA you couldn't stop them .PERIOD you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody 
So the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent 
And what is happening with this is some kind of ai ,COMMA but it's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert .PERIOD larry page told me that that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD and that's what they're trying to do .PERIOD 
But it'll anticipate what we're doing in a good sense ,COMMA 
And all these devices will be portals into that 
It was on jonestown .PERIOD 
The top picture is a group of moonies ,COMMA that have been blessed by their messiah .PERIOD 
And so what is this ?QUESTIONMARK how does this work 
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable .PERIOD 
We're beginning to look inside the brain 
And so ,COMMA if you looked at my brain or any brain that's infected with a viral ,COMMA memetic infection like this ,COMMA and compared it to anyone in this room ,COMMA or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis ,COMMA i am convinced it would look very ,COMMA very different .PERIOD 
Because i have to say ,COMMA for my whole career ,COMMA if there's anything that's been consistent .PERIOD it's been that you can't do it 
It's calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line .PERIOD not the straight line 
We make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process .PERIOD they make cities 
And i've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself .PERIOD 
This is a project that we just finished in penang for a very ,COMMA very large city project that came directly out of this process ,COMMA which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it 
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material 
This will be the first building in the united states that took -- well ,COMMA i can't say it took the air conditioning out .PERIOD it's a hybrid 
And i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth's surface ,COMMA and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense 
What i'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people 
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground ,COMMA and it becomes part of the idea 
And then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic ,COMMA the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts ,COMMA geologic shifts ,COMMA right 
And finally ,COMMA one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse ,COMMA 
Here's a piano nobile ,COMMA which is a device used in the renaissance 
It changed the way our history developed 
It is made for a diet which is soft ,COMMA mushy ,COMMA which is reduced in fibers ,COMMA which is very easily chewable and digestible .PERIOD 
Sounds like fast food ,COMMA doesn't it 
It's technology 
So this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this most marvelous technology 
We populated all the ecologies 
It keeps also your brain working 
Okay ,COMMA it's not obvious to be honest .PERIOD 
Now having a large brain ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA is a big advantage ,COMMA because you can actually influence your environment 
You know ,COMMA we have up to five tastes ,COMMA three of them sustain us .PERIOD 
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing ,COMMA because we know that in cooking ,COMMA we can transform it to the form 
So satisfaction was a very important part 
If you get a stomach ache ,COMMA if you get a little bit bloated ,COMMA was not the right food was not the right cooking manipulation ,COMMA or maybe other things went wrong .PERIOD 
But what it means to have a brain there is that not only the big brain has to talk with the food .PERIOD the food has to talk with the brain ,COMMA because we have to learn actually how to talk to the brains 
This is the layer ,COMMA which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest ,COMMA which is actually the lumen 
What it means is that we have a layered control system 
So :COLON if you override the hunger signal ,COMMA you can have a disorder ,COMMA which is called anorexia 
This is fat digestion .PERIOD 
Actually what happens is that a very intricate structure appears 
You know ,COMMA culture was born of the imagination and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it -- came into being when our species descended from our progenitor ,COMMA homo erectus ,COMMA and infused with consciousness ,COMMA began a journey that would carry it to every corner of the habitable world 
And the way clayton put it was this way 
I recently sailed on the hokulea named after the sacred star of hawaii throughout the south pacific to make a film about the navigators 
I spent 30 years living amongst the people of chinchero ,COMMA and i always heard about an event that i always wanted to participate in 
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses ,COMMA 
These ,COMMA of course ,COMMA are the descendants of the ancient tairona civilization ,COMMA 
There are four societies ?QUESTIONMARK the kogi the wiwa ,COMMA the kankwano and the arhuacos 
I traveled with the arhuacos ,COMMA and the wonderful thing about this story was that this man ,COMMA danilo villafane -- if we just jump back here for a second 
We traveled high into the paramo ,COMMA and as we crested the hills ,COMMA we realized that the men were interpreting every single bump on the landscape ,COMMA in terms of their own intense religiosity 
And we ran into a farc patrol at dawn .PERIOD so it was quite harrowing .PERIOD 
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world as the younger brothers .PERIOD they cannot understand why it is that we do what we do to the earth 
And when asked that question ,COMMA they respond with 6000 different voices 
They are unique answers to that fundamental question .PERIOD what does it mean to be human and alive ?QUESTIONMARK 
So you're living through a time when virtually half of humanity's intellectual ,COMMA social and spiritual legacy is being allowed to slip away 
This does not have to happen 
So i'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today ,COMMA imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years 
This is crazy 
If you're in northern europe or north america ,COMMA you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls 
Because the manufacturing process is our organism 
They're not going to clog up earth's ecosystems .PERIOD they work great 
My brief ,COMMA as you've just heard is to tell you about statistics -- and to be more precise to tell you some exciting things about statistics 
Don't tell her ,COMMA i said that 
She paused and said ,COMMA he models things 
The next time after the 15th toss 
That's what i want this side to think about 
Either they're the same ,COMMA or this one's bigger than this one ,COMMA or this one's bigger than that .PERIOD one 
Who thinks that c is true -- that on average ,COMMA it'll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail .PERIOD 
The champagne's on ice just next to you .PERIOD you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate 
And if it comes down a head ,COMMA that's great 
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence 
If it's a head you're disappointed ,COMMA but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again .PERIOD 
This is my little diversion into my real passion ,COMMA which is genetics 
When you toss a coin ,COMMA you get a sequence of heads and tails 
And they're an enormously useful tool .PERIOD in modern molecular biology 
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies ,COMMA a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you'll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job ,COMMA rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques 
It's not the answer ,COMMA and it's not because it's only part of the story .PERIOD 
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals 
Those of you ,COMMA in britain will know about what's become ,COMMA rather a celebrated case of a woman called sally clark who had two babies who died .PERIOD suddenly 
And to argue ,COMMA then that the chance of a second death is ,COMMA as if you didn't know that information is really silly .PERIOD 
One of them is that sally clark was innocent -- which is ,COMMA a priori ,COMMA overwhelmingly likely -- most mothers don't kill their children 
So just to conclude -- what are the take-home messages from this 
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty .PERIOD 
All of quality control ,COMMA which has had a major impact on industrial processing ,COMMA is underpinned by statistics ,COMMA 
This is a world-changing invention 
Well ,COMMA it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring 
Hmmm 
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims 
So to conclude ,COMMA intelligent power can globally ,COMMA save thousands of lives ,COMMA prevent tens of thousands of injuries and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage .PERIOD every single year ,COMMA while significantly reducing global energy consumption ,COMMA 
In the spirit of this year's ted conference ,COMMA we think this is a powerful ,COMMA world-changing invention 
And that's what i'd like to talk to you a little bit about today ,COMMA 
It's acoustic vibrations in the air ,COMMA little waves of energy in the air .PERIOD that tickle our eardrum 
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this 
In fact ,COMMA nothing even actually comes close to our ability to restore hearing 
And as a physician and a surgeon ,COMMA i can confidently tell my patients that if you had to pick a sense to lose ,COMMA we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing 
Okay ,COMMA play that video ,COMMA please 
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face 
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years 
I mean ,COMMA literally ,COMMA they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears and stick funnels in 
Language is very different .PERIOD language is very precise 
In fact ,COMMA the whole reason we use it is because it has semantic-specificity 
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended 
What that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss ,COMMA the capacity for music remains 
And here's a video of joseph 
Joseph i was born in 1986 
When i was 12 years old ,COMMA i was one of the first few people in singapore who underwent cochlear implantation 
And this is really unheard of stuff .PERIOD and this is all because of this technology 
You don't actually have to hear it 
I know he doesn't hear well ,COMMA because i've heard him do karaoke 
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us 
And so i'm here to tell you ,COMMA you don't need a computer to actually have a spell .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program .PERIOD that's what happens in proteins 
When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms .PERIOD these little letters are sticky for each other .PERIOD 
So here's a shape i actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear ,COMMA coding like linus [torvalds] in that picture before 
I mix them together ,COMMA add a little bit of salt water ,COMMA and then add this long strand i was telling you about that i've stolen from a virus .PERIOD and then what happens is ,COMMA you heat this whole thing up to about boiling you cool ,COMMA it down to room temperature .PERIOD and as you do ,COMMA what happens is those short strands .PERIOD they do the following thing .PERIOD each one of them binds that long strand in one place .PERIOD and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place ,COMMA and brings those two parts of the long strand close together ,COMMA so that they stick together 
You can make a molecule that looks like this .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA he likes to hang out with his buddies ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So that's dna origami .PERIOD that's one way .PERIOD there are many ways of casting molecular spells using dna .PERIOD 
I did not choose to take up the pen ,COMMA the brush ,COMMA the camera 
Why did i choose the gun as my instrument ?QUESTIONMARK 
My father was a hardworking baker .PERIOD but when he had finished work in the bakery ,COMMA he often told me and my brother stories 
My father was there to provide it 
He fired nothing happened 
The murder rate in europe has dropped by a factor of 30 .PERIOD since the middle ages ,COMMA 
Why has violence decreased 
Or is there something else 
The armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence ,COMMA 
My soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace 
And that is ,COMMA why -- and in the netherlands ,COMMA we are very unique in that -- that is ,COMMA why the dutch constitution states that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law .PERIOD 
And i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression ,COMMA 
I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there when they come home ,COMMA and when they are injured and need our care 
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock 
Women are much more in balance ,COMMA because they don't have that idea that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .PERIOD 
They think about how to get the weight over their feet ,COMMA because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long 
It took us 15 years to sequence hiv -- we sequenced sars in 31 days ,COMMA 
If you put different communication technologies on this logarithmic graph ,COMMA television ,COMMA radio ,COMMA telephone were adopted in decades .PERIOD 
Now by the way ,COMMA if you look at this on a linear graph ,COMMA it looks like everything has just happened .PERIOD but some observer says ,COMMA well kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall on that straight line .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA it forms the same straight line .PERIOD you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have disagreements .PERIOD what the key points are .PERIOD there's differences of opinion when agriculture started .PERIOD or how long the cambrian explosion took 
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900 ,COMMA two years in the middle we're now doubling it every one year .PERIOD 
Supercomputers -- same thing 
You would think it would be a very erratic process ,COMMA and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process 
As we make them smaller and less expensive .PERIOD the electrons have less distance to travel 
And economists have actually started worrying about that 
This is due to greater productivity .PERIOD but the economist says ,COMMA but there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that 
These were evolved in very different times -- we'd like to actually change those programs 
We'd like to actually turn that program off 
Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed ,COMMA this felt that would be interesting drug for the human market .PERIOD and that's just one of the 30000 genes ,COMMA that affect our biochemistry 
For example ,COMMA we can inhibit genes now with rna interference 
It's now under a 10th of a cent 
Once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating .PERIOD we can actually design these things to be thousands of times more capable .PERIOD 
Where will we get the software 
Wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology ,COMMA which it was .PERIOD but then six months later ,COMMA when it hadn't revolutionized all business models ,COMMA they figured ,COMMA well that was wrong .PERIOD and then we had this bust .PERIOD 
Images will be written directly to our retina ,COMMA providing full-immersion virtual reality ,COMMA augmented real reality .PERIOD we'll be interacting with virtual personalities 
You can go there with other people have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses ,COMMA 
But most importantly ,COMMA it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology ,COMMA which ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA we're doing already 
It's just like this one ,COMMA completely worthless ,COMMA in which it allegedly worked by electrostatic magnetic ion attraction ,COMMA which translates to pseudoscientific baloney -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,COMMA but it does absolutely nothing 
In this case ,COMMA at trespass points ,COMMA allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were .PERIOD okay ,COMMA actually cost lives 
And in fact ,COMMA i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things 
And that's called superstition ,COMMA and that i'm afraid we will always have with us 
You are a hominid three million years ago ,COMMA walking on the plains of africa ,COMMA 
You've been taken out of the gene pool 
The fish is degraded .PERIOD 20 percent 50 percent .PERIOD and then the one i showed you 70 percent 
And if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists ,COMMA they go away 
Every time somebody looks at you ,COMMA you think people are staring at you 
Because the lights on here 
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the dolphins right 
That's a dolphin tail there guys 
So you recognize obama immediately 
And this is also ,COMMA i think the basis of conspiracy theories 
Explains a lot ,COMMA maybe 
Well that's a whole other lecture .PERIOD 
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe ,COMMA you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences ,COMMA near-death experiences ,COMMA which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe .PERIOD there 
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience ,COMMA 
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief 
Okay ,COMMA now i'm going to ask you to pucker up ,COMMA 
Pucker up ,COMMA big and lean in just a little bit .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
Jennifer ,COMMA the man came and started undressing me .PERIOD 
Woman ,COMMA they insisted that i was lying 
Text :COLON uganda ratified the convention against torture in 1986 
Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering ,COMMA whether physical or mental ,COMMA is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity to obtain information or a confession ,COMMA to punish ,COMMA coerce or intimidate 
And as the story of mr .PERIOD morales just down the road .PERIOD excuse me ,COMMA mr .PERIOD gabriel would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit 
Witness 
There could be a new movement growing up rising from the ground reaching for the light and growing strong ,COMMA just like a tree .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
So in that 18 minutes or 10 minutes or five minutes ,COMMA you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics 
Next up is knowledge 
You walk in the door .PERIOD so the first thing you've got to do -- the overall ,COMMA you know ,COMMA arc of your presentation -- it's got to start like a rocket 
And everything has got to be reinforcing this 
Okay ,COMMA so how do you do that 
Well ,COMMA first of all logical progression .PERIOD 
You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones 
You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there 
So this all feeds in together ,COMMA 
You want absolute -- this is the zen of presentation ,COMMA right 
So with that said ,COMMA we only have a very ,COMMA very short time ,COMMA 
You do that you give me your quick 15-second or 30-second intro ,COMMA grab my attention 
We build widgets for the x ,COMMA y ,COMMA z market 
If it's a website ,COMMA show me a screenshot of your website .PERIOD 
Five is a bit much probably four is rational 
And i look at the logo -- okay ,COMMA good 
Powerpoint has this built into every copy of powerpoint that's shipped 
And the number one presentation tip .PERIOD never ever look at the screen 
And that is how to pitch to a vc 
I'm here today to start a revolution 
Now before you get up in arms ,COMMA or you break into song ,COMMA or you pick a favorite color ,COMMA i want to define what i mean by revolution .PERIOD 
We're last place in health care ,COMMA and that's important for a sense of well-being .PERIOD 
That's social .PERIOD let's look at education .PERIOD 
Because it's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context ,COMMA which told us what in communism ,COMMA 
It's a serious gene 
True story ,COMMA i went looking for a school for my kid ,COMMA 
It can't be because of play 
Throughout the animal kingdom ,COMMA for example ,COMMA ants ants play 
Kittens play ,COMMA we all know kittens play 
And it's not just kids .PERIOD it's adults too 
These guys are facts 
The opposite of play is not work 
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals ,COMMA there's benefits for play at work .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the professional athlete that loves skiing .PERIOD he's serious about it ,COMMA but he loves it 
A doctor might be serious ,COMMA but laughter's still a great medicine 
You guys have to ,COMMA and if you're not feeling it ,COMMA your colleagues ,COMMA your employees aren't going to feel it 
Fear is the enemy of play 
Let them take long lunches 
What we need is a players' uprising 
What we need is a players' uprising 
What we need is a players' uprising 
And i am illustrating still 
Which ,COMMA of course ,COMMA i am not agreeing with because although i am 94 ,COMMA i am not still working 
I still have -- or did i use the word still ?QUESTIONMARK i didn't mean that 
These were just some of the things i've made 
These are tiles the word ,COMMA playful is a necessary aspect of our work .PERIOD because actually ,COMMA one of our problems is that we have to make produce lovely things throughout all of life .PERIOD and this for me is now 75 years 
So ,COMMA how can you without drying up make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others for so long 
I started as an apprentice to a hungarian craftsman ,COMMA and this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages ,COMMA 
We mashed the clay with our feet ,COMMA when it came from the hillside 
And finally ,COMMA i had received a document that i had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully ,COMMA that i had behaved morally ,COMMA and this document was given to me by the guild of roof-coverers .PERIOD rail-diggers oven-setters chimney ,COMMA sweeps and potters 
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions ,COMMA and i still have that workbook 
My mother thought that this was not very proper ,COMMA so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the director the chemist model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself ,COMMA much more with the art department -- that means with my work -- than making toilets .PERIOD so finally ,COMMA they got a letter from the center from the bank who owned the factory ,COMMA saying ,COMMA make toilet-setting behind the art department .PERIOD and that was my end 
So i will try speed it up a little moderator :COLON eva we have about five minutes 
The accusation was that i had successfully prepared an attentat on stalin's life .PERIOD 
But since i survived ,COMMA and i'm here and since this is the end of the five minutes ,COMMA i will -- moderator :COLON tell me when your last trip to russia ,COMMA was 
Oh ,COMMA this summer ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the lomonosov factory was bought by an american company ,COMMA invited me 
That's my camera lens .PERIOD the first one -- the one i shot ,COMMA my bob dylan film with 35 years ago ,COMMA 
I called my sister i called my neighbors .PERIOD i said ,COMMA come dig 
That's my sister she took care of pictures ,COMMA because i was a big collector of snapshot photography ,COMMA that i believed said a lot 
She's still there .PERIOD she's there this morning ,COMMA actually 
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this 
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful ,COMMA beautiful child .PERIOD and i remember ,COMMA as she was approaching me ,COMMA the voices of friends saying the moment they put the baby in your hands ,COMMA you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life .PERIOD 
And it was also ,COMMA of course ,COMMA surreal 
You're either in love ,COMMA or you're not in love 
I enjoyed being pregnant ,COMMA i loved it 
Of those 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two 
In the process of preparing this ,COMMA we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time ,COMMA because here ,COMMA in the western world ,COMMA less than 50 percent of us live near our family members ,COMMA which i think is part of why this is such a tough period .PERIOD 
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in .PERIOD the miracle that is childbirth and family 
As you get older ,COMMA you become more stable ,COMMA 
You start to realize that ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps ,COMMA but it's more likely that i'll feel claustrophobic .PERIOD and i won't be able to get a beer 
So your average happiness goes up ,COMMA but you lose those transcendent moments 
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way ,COMMA which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .PERIOD 
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments 
So ,COMMA where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this 
There's another factor in our case ,COMMA 
And we had reservations about this on the front end ,COMMA 
Get out of the airplane ,COMMA it turns out you're trekking in nepal .PERIOD 
Rg + ?QUESTIONMARK av ?QUESTIONMARK thank you .PERIOD 
We crave to be in the room with the musician ,COMMA the day it was recorded the day .PERIOD it was played 
And we go to live concerts ,COMMA and we get that as much as we can 
And yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano .PERIOD there 
He just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like -- a performing monkey was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA his term 
His maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations 
He wrote some early pieces ,COMMA but late in his life in his mature period .PERIOD he said ,COMMA here's a theme -- 30 variations 
And gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono ,COMMA and one in stereo 
What i'd like you to hear ,COMMA live ,COMMA is the 1955 version ,COMMA and we'll play the first couple pieces of it .PERIOD 
So in the video world ,COMMA we've been able to invent in our lifetimes ,COMMA natural behavior 
And when you put on headphones and you listen to this ,COMMA you're inside of glenn gould's body 
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever 
We made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september 
And fortunately ,COMMA it's right in here ,COMMA 
I want to start just by saying a bit about where i'm coming from 
I trained briefly as a buddhist monk under this guy ,COMMA 
And although that was great for the music business at the time ,COMMA it wasn't much good for anything else .PERIOD 
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity ,COMMA but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed 
Rates of depression carried on up right across the western world ,COMMA 
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream 
Ronald reagan ,COMMA again ,COMMA said ,COMMA the two funniest sentences in the english language are .PERIOD i'm from the government ?QUESTIONMARK and i'm here to help 
And i think more ,COMMA and more people are also asking why boost consumption ,COMMA rather than change what we consume 
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter than they were a hundred years ago .PERIOD maybe they are ,COMMA but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did 
And he believed we live with others .PERIOD we share the world with others ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA our innovation must be done with others ,COMMA too ,COMMA not doing things at people for them ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
Others are much more pragmatic .PERIOD health coaches .PERIOD learning .PERIOD mentors .PERIOD job .PERIOD clubs .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the idea that all of this represents ,COMMA i think is rapidly becoming a common sense ,COMMA and part of how we respond to the crisis ,COMMA recognizing the need to invest in innovation ,COMMA for social progress as well as technological progress ,COMMA 
There were big health innovation funds launched earlier this year in this country as well as a public service ,COMMA innovation lab 
And if a generation or two ago ,COMMA the big challenges were ones like getting a man on the moon ,COMMA perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves .PERIOD now are ones like eliminating child malnutrition ,COMMA stopping trafficking ,COMMA or one ,COMMA i think closer to home for america or europe .PERIOD why don't we set ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK the goal of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA those are all goals ,COMMA which could be achieved within a decade ,COMMA but only with radical and systematic experiment not just with technologies ,COMMA but also with lifestyles and culture and policies and institutions too .PERIOD 
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy 
Just as today ,COMMA the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature ,COMMA only now it's individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
You think i've lost my way ,COMMA and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute and guide me ,COMMA gently back to my seat 
I want to tell you about my friend who was teaching english to adults in abu dhabi ,COMMA 
And one fine day ,COMMA she decided to take them into the garden to teach them .PERIOD some nature vocabulary 
A language dies every 14 days 
That is a little bit too early 
We were brought to teach english because the government wanted to modernize the country and to empower the citizens through education ,COMMA 
But if you're not a native speaker ,COMMA you have to pass a test 
Do we really want to end up with 600 languages ,COMMA and the main one being english or chinese 
And i want to remind you that the giants upon whose shoulders today's intelligentsia stand did not have to have english .PERIOD they didn't have to pass an english test 
Let me tell you a story about two scientists .PERIOD two english .PERIOD scientists 
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp .PERIOD 
When he received his award ,COMMA he said ,COMMA these lovely words ,COMMA the children can lead africa from what it is today .PERIOD a dark continent to a light continent .PERIOD 
I am known best for human-powered flight ,COMMA but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i'm working in now ,COMMA 
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense ,COMMA but you could do it ,COMMA and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power ,COMMA and maybe help that field 
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals ,COMMA and we can do things much more efficiently ,COMMA 
So this just summarizes it over billions of years ,COMMA on a unique sphere ,COMMA chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable ,COMMA wonderful and fragile 
Suddenly we humans ,COMMA a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature ,COMMA have grown in population ,COMMA technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .PERIOD we now wield the paintbrush .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA and let's have the next 
And then also ,COMMA like it said in the video ,COMMA you can turn it left or right ,COMMA just by putting the lift under one wing or another 
And that's it .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD just a few inventions 
Most of the talks that you've heard in the last several fabulous days have been from people who have the characteristic that they have thought about something .PERIOD they are experts ,COMMA they know what's going on 
All of you know ,COMMA about the topic that i'm supposed to talk about 
Well ,COMMA it enables you to drink coffee 
And the other ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a birth control pill ,COMMA which in a very simple way ,COMMA fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it ,COMMA by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices .PERIOD 
It's like what is simplicity 
What is the state of science 
And interestingly ,COMMA complexity is very highly evolved 
One of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task -- which you may not know that you have very often -- which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation 
And the words that i would like you to focus on are complexity and emergence ,COMMA because these will enable you to start the conversation and then daydream about other things 
And that's complexity 
All right .PERIOD so let me give you an example of simplicity of a particular kind 
The question is ,COMMA why is binary simpler than arabic ?QUESTIONMARK 
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent 
That is you can stack them 
And you put a drop in this case of urine at the bottom 
It turns colors in this particular case you're reading kidney function 
If you take too much out of something that's simple ,COMMA you lose function .PERIOD 
So you can't make it too simple 
And the second is a design issue ,COMMA and it's not directly relevant ,COMMA but it's a nice statement 
So what i think one can begin to do with this kind of cut at the word simplicity ,COMMA which doesn't cover brancusi .PERIOD it doesn't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse ,COMMA or simpler ,COMMA or less simpler than van gogh ,COMMA and certainly doesn't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach .PERIOD 
You've got a company set up to 
I want to open by quoting einstein's wonderful statement ,COMMA just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us and also calls us to this action 
I know ,COMMA the next buddha will come a few thousand years from now ,COMMA but exists currently in a certain heaven -- that's maitreya -- so i'm going to go on a retreat ,COMMA and i'm going to meditate and pray until the buddha maitreya reveals himself to me ,COMMA and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today ,COMMA 
And the man said ,COMMA really ,COMMA and he showed him a dish full of needles .PERIOD 
So he said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i get the point 
He went back to his cave .PERIOD he meditated again 
Another three years ,COMMA no vision .PERIOD he leaves ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
So he thought i will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh ,COMMA then clean the dog's wounds ,COMMA and then ,COMMA i'll figure out what to do with the maggots 
So he starts to do that ,COMMA he can't grab the maggots 
He jumps back ,COMMA and there of course ,COMMA is the future buddha maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights ,COMMA golden ,COMMA jeweled ,COMMA a plasma body ,COMMA an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees 
So as he comes up from his first bow ,COMMA he says ,COMMA my lord ,COMMA i'm so happy to see you ,COMMA but where have you been for 12 years 
And maitreya says i was with you who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks .PERIOD for you mister dense 
Looking for the buddha in person ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA they chased him out of town ,COMMA 
You gave me that expression the eternal mama ?QUESTIONMARK you said ,COMMA that's wonderful .PERIOD 
So they first create this foundation of equality ,COMMA 
And we don't hate anyone ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA so we equalize that's very important 
And this is the way you do it .PERIOD you take any being who looks weird to you ,COMMA and you see how they could be familiar to you 
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings 
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility 
And they then never get any positive feedback 
Compassion makes you happy 
The first person who is happy ,COMMA when you get great .PERIOD compassion is yourself ,COMMA even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else 
Because traditional economic theory would say ,COMMA well ,COMMA the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r&ampd lab ,COMMA where they were thinking up ,COMMA new projects .PERIOD and it came out of there .PERIOD it didn't come from there .PERIOD 
The ideas are coming back from the consumers ,COMMA and they're often ahead of the producers 
The very first landline telephones ,COMMA the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters 
More and more ,COMMA the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance 
The second reason ,COMMA why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big ,COMMA disruptive innovations 
Take astronomy as an example ,COMMA which yochai has already mentioned 
What does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK then ,COMMA for our organizational landscape 
Let me just give you two examples .PERIOD 
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft ,COMMA outlook .PERIOD no one 
Because the professionals over here ,COMMA in these closed organizations -- they might be academics ,COMMA they might be programmers .PERIOD they might be doctors .PERIOD they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say ,COMMA no ,COMMA no -- you can't trust these people over here .PERIOD 
They want to as jimmy said they want to have a dialogue ,COMMA a conversation 
What should be the role of public policy 
And i was having dinner with this guy called .PERIOD timothy chan 
Didn't go into the internet kept his money ,COMMA decided to go into computer games .PERIOD 
At any one time there are four million people playing one of his games .PERIOD 
How many people does he employ to service that population 
Well ,COMMA how can he service 250 million people from 500 employees 
Imagine you could take all the children in education in britain .PERIOD and one percent of them were co-developers of education ,COMMA 
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to ,COMMA in some sense ,COMMA be co-producers of health ,COMMA 
For example ,COMMA i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners 
And i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job .PERIOD 
And so i said ,COMMA let's put this together ,COMMA in an album 
We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier .PERIOD but ultimately ,COMMA what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person 
Recording ?QUESTIONMARK okay ,COMMA here's something 
But sometimes i feel really lonely 
Like even people in convenience stores saying have a nice day when they're accidentally looking me in the eye ,COMMA 
And i got a lot like 30 in a half an hour 
I was like ,COMMA i don't know 
But anyway ,COMMA this same person laura ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .PERIOD 
So i asked her ,COMMA what does it feel like when you feel this way ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll think about it 
And when you put them together ,COMMA something magical happens ,COMMA something absolutely incredible happens .PERIOD and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world 
And over the past 35 years ,COMMA i've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters ,COMMA dopamine ,COMMA things like that ,COMMA all the way through circuit analysis ,COMMA 
It's really a very precisely timed thing ,COMMA 
So there is the pattern that every one of them had ,COMMA but they all were a little different too ,COMMA 
A key thing is that the major violence genes .PERIOD it's called the mao-a gene 
It's on the x chromosome .PERIOD and so in this way ,COMMA you can only get it from your mother 
And what i think might happen in these areas of the world ,COMMA where we have constant violence ,COMMA you end up having generations of kids that are seeing all this violence .PERIOD 
Now i said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA so what we have lizzie 
But it doesn't stop there 
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere 
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted 
So you might be asking why 
Absolutely everything 
Actually ,COMMA if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun ,COMMA passing through every square centimeter of your body 
And these particles have been discovered over the last century ,COMMA pretty much 
One of the wonderful things ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i find is that we've discovered any of them when you realize how tiny they are 
So one of my most illustrious forebears at manchester university ,COMMA ernest rutherford ,COMMA discoverer of the atomic nucleus .PERIOD once said ,COMMA all science is either physics or stamp collecting 
Now ,COMMA i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science ,COMMA although he was from new zealand ,COMMA so it's possible ,COMMA 
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room 
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body ,COMMA and in the universe that we see around us are heavy ,COMMA in a sense and massive ,COMMA because they're surrounded by higgs particles 
This is a creation story .PERIOD i think ,COMMA equally as wonderful 
So that's the lhc 
When i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers .PERIOD i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth .PERIOD 
By measuring their student smiles .PERIOD researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage will be how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others 
Outside of this room ,COMMA more than a third of us smile ,COMMA more than 20 times per day ,COMMA whereas less than 14 percent of us smile ,COMMA less than five 
The finding supported darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain ,COMMA in a way that helps us feel better .PERIOD when we smile 
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .PERIOD 
The grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing ,COMMA and they are challenging the old models ,COMMA the old analog models of control and command .PERIOD 
If you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map ,COMMA kibera is represented as a lush ,COMMA green national park ,COMMA devoid of human settlement .PERIOD 
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers ,COMMA but they need to be elevated to software .PERIOD strategists ,COMMA 
But if you're like me my humanity is more like a window 
Then suddenly i see it and usually it's never good 
My mother was english 
She was five foot two ,COMMA very feisty ,COMMA and very english 
This is how english my mother is -- or was she just passed 
And then we went to a fish restaurant ,COMMA and we had chad ,COMMA the surfer dude ,COMMA serving us .PERIOD and he came up .PERIOD and my mother said ,COMMA do you have any specials ,COMMA young man 
And my mother turned to me and said ,COMMA what language is he speaking 
But her igbo wasn't too good .PERIOD 
So here are these women who never discuss their period with their husbands .PERIOD and here i am telling them .PERIOD well ,COMMA how often do you get your period 
It was my mother with five little children 
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman ,COMMA standing up to men with guns who want to kill us 
And she said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble ,COMMA any kind of horror 
And then the next planting season ,COMMA when they sang the dirge ,COMMA they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born 
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men 
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us 
And a lot of rituals involved ,COMMA killing killing little animals ,COMMA progressing along ,COMMA so when i turned 13 -- and i mean ,COMMA it made sense .PERIOD it was an agrarian community ,COMMA somebody had to kill the animals .PERIOD there was no whole foods .PERIOD you could go and get kangaroo steak at -- so when i turned 13 ,COMMA it was my turn now to kill a goat .PERIOD 
Now when i was growing up ,COMMA he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people ,COMMA and their intestines would fall out ,COMMA but they would keep running 
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back .PERIOD so he summoned me up ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA go into the bedroom .PERIOD my bedroom ,COMMA 
That's basically how this thing operates .PERIOD 
So one of the advantages of this design is ,COMMA when you scale things down ,COMMA the robot ,COMMA naturally becomes agile 
It's inversely proportional to r 
No matter how you throw it the robot recovers and comes back to him 
So here are robots carrying beams columns and assembling cube-like structures 
So you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads 
So we use a little trick 
They sense their neighbors ,COMMA 
So again ,COMMA the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands ,COMMA 100 times a second ,COMMA which then translates to the motor commands .PERIOD 600 times a second 
As you can see here ,COMMA they collapse from a three-dimensional formation into planar formation ,COMMA 
Another application ,COMMA i want to show you -- again ,COMMA this is in our lab 
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements .PERIOD 
So all these experiments ,COMMA you've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems 
It figures out where it is with respect to the features ,COMMA and then estimates its position 100 times a second allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier 
You will see nine robots play .PERIOD six different instruments .PERIOD 
Let's watch 
Unless you're on one of these californian low-carb diets .PERIOD bread is standard 
And i think it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity .PERIOD 
And this is about good taste .PERIOD good traditions ,COMMA 
But we have somehow ,COMMA in the course of the last few centuries ,COMMA or even decades ,COMMA started to cultivate an image of a mythical ,COMMA rural agricultural past .PERIOD 
So what is happening 
Bread has migrated to tropical countries ,COMMA where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava 
This is where it all comes from ,COMMA and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago ,COMMA put us on the road of bread 
Let's go back to traditional farming 
And i'm making a real plea here 
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control 
What i want us to do is to keep up the science ,COMMA and even get more science in there ,COMMA but go to a kind of regional scale -- not just in terms of the scale of the fields ,COMMA but in terms of the entire food network ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what kind of science can we have 
We cannot solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture 
Everything is linked together ,COMMA 
Understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events 
And as you eat it ,COMMA and as you try it -- please come and stand up 
Every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world 
And that i think ,COMMA evolutionarily-speaking is unique 
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water 
This crocodile ,COMMA which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers ,COMMA and this charismatic snake .PERIOD the king cobra 
And it really works to start with them 
The people of this part of india worship ,COMMA the king cobra 
It's just a wresting match ,COMMA but a remarkable activity ,COMMA 
And now the king cobra is a new one 
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off ,COMMA 
In fact ,COMMA if you see the map ,COMMA the range of their original habitat was all the way from the indus in pakistan to the irrawaddy in burma 
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this 
This was actually just taken last year .PERIOD 
My pals in the crocodile specialist group of the iucn .PERIOD the [madras crocodile ,COMMA bank] an ngo ,COMMA the world wildlife fund ,COMMA the wildlife institute of india state forest departments and the ministry of environment .PERIOD we all work together on stuff 
So it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain .PERIOD something in the fish they were eating 
But poolan devi was one [of them] which actually shekhar kapur :COLON made an incredible movie ,COMMA the bandit queen ,COMMA which i urge you to see 
So who is next us 
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there 
So we can do it 
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river .PERIOD 
Namaste ,COMMA 
I look at it as a creature ,COMMA who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being 
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before 
And the guy who is working there with them ,COMMA he's from maharashtra .PERIOD he said ,COMMA i think he's after the nusha .PERIOD 
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush 
To me ,COMMA that’s the real natural wonder 
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30000 dollars per patient and medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train 
And i’ll talk more about this .PERIOD but the real epidemic isn’t just heart disease or obesity or smoking -- it’s loneliness and depression 
And the pain is not the problem .PERIOD it’s the symptom 
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ,COMMA 
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired ,COMMA lethargic ,COMMA depressed and impotent .PERIOD and that’s not much fun 
Your sexual function improves 
When you eat a big fatty meal ,COMMA how do you feel 
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards 
These are not election returns .PERIOD these are the percentage of people who are overweight 
He says ,COMMA i’ve got some good news .PERIOD 
What we found was that after a year ,COMMA none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment .PERIOD whereas six of the control-group patients needed surgery or radiation .PERIOD 
And then i wondered ,COMMA was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle -- whichever group they were in -- and the changes ,COMMA in psa 
The last thing i want to talk about ,COMMA apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness is that study .PERIOD after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed -- and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture -- are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely .PERIOD in part ,COMMA because as we talked about ,COMMA they’re more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
It can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .PERIOD 
And at the end of it ,COMMA somebody said ,COMMA hey swami .PERIOD what’s the difference between wellness and illness .PERIOD 
And so he went up on the board ,COMMA and he wrote the word illness ,COMMA and circled the first letter ,COMMA and then wrote the word wellness ,COMMA and circled the first two letters 
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization 
Hopefully it won't stutter 
And if we did our jobs ,COMMA well ,COMMA you won't know that we were even involved 
Some you could see some you couldn't 
Now ,COMMA there's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor's body 
Now fincher is an interesting guy .PERIOD 
And so david had an interesting take on the film ,COMMA and he threw a challenge at us 
We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david ,COMMA and we ruled out ,COMMA of course ,COMMA swapping actors 
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts .PERIOD 
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program 
And of course ,COMMA the first step is admit you've got a problem 
So we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do 
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 ,COMMA and where we needed it to be 
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture 
But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking .PERIOD and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face ,COMMA and doing the same process 
We needed the subtleties of the skin 
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things 
So clearly we were in a substantially better place for this 
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count 
This was the breakthrough 
This is brad doing one of the ekman ,COMMA facs poses 
We shot him with four hd cameras ,COMMA so we'd get multiple views of him .PERIOD and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast 
And here you can see the body actor .PERIOD 
We also had to create an eye system 
He was very popular 
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance 
So as things went through this process ,COMMA fincher would always say ,COMMA it sandblasts the edges off of the performance .PERIOD 
So it sees a smile as a smile 
But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology emotion capture ,COMMA as opposed to just motion capture 
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal .PERIOD rod 
And we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA here is some seed fund 
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society .PERIOD so we were able to address that 
We rescued over 550 dancing bears 
Now the end product of that action is up on the board here 
When i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about .PERIOD i had recently come back from jordan ,COMMA where i had an amazing experience with a camel 
The guys got out ,COMMA they put the hood up .PERIOD they started working under the hood .PERIOD got it going again .PERIOD about a hundred yards .PERIOD it broke down 
And they said ,COMMA ah ,COMMA no problem .PERIOD we just get out and walk 
And they said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we'll walk .PERIOD we'll find some camels .PERIOD 
So we'll need to be very careful around him .PERIOD don't let him get you 
When they're in rut -- they're similar to seals in the way ,COMMA like a seal has to open its nose to breathe 
They use them to pinpoint sound 
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold ,COMMA 
But they use their tails a lot ,COMMA especially in rut ,COMMA 
But on this particular occasion ,COMMA it was very ,COMMA very clear that as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it 
So i'm going to show you another film 
But before i do ,COMMA i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand ,COMMA the ship of the desert .PERIOD it's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely mongolia .PERIOD and sahara -- that there are 160 words in arabic ,COMMA to describe the camel 
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee ,COMMA it's certainly been like no committee i've ever been on 
So ,COMMA here's what suki would do in search of a mate 
I'm ted camel 
I'm smartly designed 
A distinguished nose ,COMMA with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture 
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat 
I'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying 
Humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because by and large ,COMMA we really don't have to adapt to our environment .PERIOD we adapt our environment to us 
But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting 
And the idea was to have me record ,COMMA some of my poems ,COMMA and then they would find animators to animate them .PERIOD 
Writing is not actually as easy as that ,COMMA for me ,COMMA 
Poetry just says a few things in different ways 
Some days ,COMMA i put the people in their places at the table ,COMMA bend their legs ,COMMA at the knees ,COMMA if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs .PERIOD 
The name of the author is the first to go ,COMMA followed obediently by the title ,COMMA the plot ,COMMA the heartbreaking conclusion ,COMMA the entire novel ,COMMA which suddenly becomes one .PERIOD you have never read .PERIOD never even heard of 
It's called the country 
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife ,COMMA having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified 
If it has a subject ,COMMA the subject is adolescence .PERIOD 
Frankly ,COMMA who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if maria callas debuted as tosca at 17 
And here comes a second follower 
Now it's not a lone nut ,COMMA it's not two nuts -- three is a crowd ,COMMA and a crowd is news 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .PERIOD 
I wrote the book on a treadmill ,COMMA and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .PERIOD 
I also tried to be the safest person i could be ,COMMA because that's a part of health 
Now it's a little extreme .PERIOD i admit ,COMMA 
But if you think about this ,COMMA this is actually -- the freakonomics authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis ,COMMA from drunk walking than from drunk driving 
Without the sex part .PERIOD 
And i finally have stabilized .PERIOD 
And i ,COMMA of course ,COMMA don't have time to go into all of them 
It really impairs cognition ,COMMA 
So without noise reduction technology ,COMMA our country would not exist 
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating doritos 
That's my greatest hope 
What might they find 
Here's a replica of one such seal 
We need to decipher the script to answer that question ,COMMA 
In fact ,COMMA the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people 
If you look at a map of india today you'll see that most of the languages spoken in north india belong to the indo-european language family 
First ,COMMA there's no rosetta stone 
And furthermore ,COMMA we don't even know what language they spoke .PERIOD 
And to make matters even worse ,COMMA most of the text that we have are extremely short 
And why was i fascinated 
And i'd like to describe some of the results that we have found 
I'll give you a couple of seconds 
Languages contain patterns 
Language on the other hand ,COMMA has an intermediate level of entropy ,COMMA it's neither too rigid .PERIOD nor is it too random 
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences 
We found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts 
Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession 
So as the old saying goes ,COMMA if it looks like a linguistic script ,COMMA and it acts like a linguistic script .PERIOD then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands 
So as an example ,COMMA here's a word 
Okay ,COMMA great 
So this is just like a crossword puzzle ,COMMA except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles because the stakes are so high if you solve it 
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign 
And it turns out that in india ,COMMA there's a long tradition of names being based on horoscopes and star constellations present at the time of birth .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA there's another sequence of six stars ,COMMA and that translates to aru meen ,COMMA which is the old dravidian name for the star constellation pleiades 
So that was pretty exciting 
But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space ,COMMA we have no sense of what space sounds like 
Now ,COMMA this story doesn't start with vast telescopes or futuristic spacecraft ,COMMA but a rather more humble technology -- and in fact ,COMMA the very medium which gave us the telecommunications revolution that we're all part of today ,COMMA the telephone 
Thomas watson spent hours listening to the strange crackles and hisses and chirps and whistles that his accidental antenna detected 
They turned out to be lightning or sources of electrical power .PERIOD 
There was a glitch in their soundtrack 
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way .PERIOD 
Because our egocentric perception -- from the buddha's point of view ,COMMA misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin 
And everyone here is unfortunately ,COMMA carrying that habitual perception a little bit right 
Like even when you're having a good time ,COMMA when is the good time over 
I think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he'd been there to hear that 
Everybody has the wrong idea .PERIOD they think buddha was so boring .PERIOD and they're so surprised when they meet dalai lama .PERIOD and he's fairly jolly 
The human being is almost out of time ,COMMA 
This is birhan ,COMMA who was the ethiopian girl who launched live aid in the 1980s .PERIOD 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued ,COMMA and that picture of her .PERIOD being rescued is one that went round the world .PERIOD 
And what do all these pictures and events have in common 
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see 
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .PERIOD 
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from william wilberforce and all the protesters 
They won public opinion over a long period of time .PERIOD 
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people’s hearts and minds 
I was with nelson mandela ,COMMA a year ago ,COMMA when he was in london ,COMMA 
I have just been talking to the president of sierra leone 
I met her in a field ,COMMA she was ragged ,COMMA she had no shoes 
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture .PERIOD so that africa is not a net importer of food ,COMMA but an exporter of food 
Making people laugh 
So please send me your ideas about how to design a foot 
We have to first know what a foot is 
And i want you to help me do that .PERIOD in this next clip ,COMMA 
See any common themes principles 
Now ,COMMA it turns out that animals can go anywhere 
If you want to study how a foot works ,COMMA we're going to have to simulate those surfaces or simulate that debris 
Without a foot .PERIOD here's what it does .PERIOD it doesn't even slow down 
That's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut 
Now ,COMMA you might have noticed something else about the animals when they were running over the rough terrain .PERIOD 
Boy spiny ,COMMA 
Do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA 
But look at this animal do it 
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it 
These are all from different insects .PERIOD 
Let's look at that ant 
You see what happens 
So to our blueprint ,COMMA we stick on some sticky pads 
These are its feet 
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends ,COMMA and that's the secret ,COMMA because it allows intimate contact 
Here you are pulling off the band-aid 
Here's the new project ,COMMA we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces 
And here it is coming up at you in its first steps up a wall ,COMMA 
And that's exactly what he's done .PERIOD 
Thank you 
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals whose world was so foreign to me ,COMMA was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate .PERIOD human sounds 
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle ,COMMA a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin .PERIOD it's done .PERIOD the right thing and can come get a fish 
Many mammals have to produce contact calls when say a mother and calf are apart 
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle against the maximum distance 
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters ,COMMA less than half the time they need to use whistles 
Most of the time they can just find each other ,COMMA just by swimming around 
And two boats .PERIOD when the second boat was added ,COMMA what happened was that some of the dolphins left the area completely 
We may need to regulate the intensity of recreational boating and actual whale watching in order to prevent these kinds of problems .PERIOD 
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at 
So you're listening to the complicated song produced by humpbacks here ,COMMA 
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast .PERIOD humpbacks 
It's loud clear -- you can hear it very clearly 
But you can still hear that faint call 
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound 
Now think about it .PERIOD this is an amazing thing that in this frequency range where whales communicate ,COMMA the main source globally ,COMMA on our planet ,COMMA for the noise comes from human ships ,COMMA thousands of human ships .PERIOD distant far away ,COMMA just all aggregating 
Same thing in the north atlantic ,COMMA in the '50s versus 2000 
So we have to be very concerned about when the noise in habitats degrades the habitat enough that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate ,COMMA or are not able to perform critical functions .PERIOD 
If you actually insulate and isolate the machinery of the ship from the hull ,COMMA you can reduce that noise by 99 percent 
What maersk did is they worked ways to slow down 
And third ,COMMA you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends .PERIOD you can create them with friends -- and that's the part that i think i'm most excited about ,COMMA because i think that at heart ,COMMA we are all storytellers .PERIOD 
Curtis wong .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD roy 
So microsoft -- this is a project that -- worldwide ,COMMA telescope is dedicated to jim gray ,COMMA who's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible 
And so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here .PERIOD and in the ted lab ,COMMA we have a tour that was created by a six-year-old ,COMMA named benjamin that will knock your socks off 
Two-thirds of all students in special ed .PERIOD remedial programs are guys 
And we're seeing a steady increase among males 
They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships ,COMMA which build gradually and subtly 
I can create big things out here ,COMMA but i can go back and really quickly go back to where i started and make even smaller things here 
But the neat thing about it is ,COMMA i can add control points .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here ,COMMA with multiple control points is actually something that's state of the art .PERIOD 
Don't worry 
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is 
I think none of these is the problem 
We want to go on with our daily life ,COMMA even though we are not living under normal circumstances .PERIOD 
In the end ,COMMA benjamín and julián ,COMMA decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together 
That devotion we feel for the national football team 
We need men and women who love mexico ,COMMA and who are willing to take action 
The battle is won ,COMMA but we still have to fight it 
Juggling three balls is simple and normal 
Ok ,COMMA then you've got to combine them ,COMMA because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you 
And then you get crazy 
Now i'm actually going to ask you to try something .PERIOD so you've got to pay attention complexity .PERIOD if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases ,COMMA so your perceptions change 
Things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn 
So complexity now how many here are jugglers 
Ok ,COMMA so ,COMMA most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this 
No ,COMMA it looks like a mess .PERIOD it looks like a mess with a guy there who's got his hands around that mess .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand 
All right .PERIOD so that's one way of doing it ,COMMA which is five balls down ,COMMA 
Make it wider 
Make it narrower 
Enough of a clue ,COMMA so you get the pattern right ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Pink 
So white ball and -- finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD pink 
Finger finger ,COMMA finger pink or finger .PERIOD 
I don't need music for it talking about time in a moment ,COMMA 
Ahhh 
So a moment 
Ok ,COMMA and then what i did as a juggler was say ,COMMA ok .PERIOD what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else ?QUESTIONMARK another dynamic 
So a moment 
Are we ready to do that .PERIOD yes ,COMMA 
Now i'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways ,COMMA and also -- oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you're bored ,COMMA not here ,COMMA here's one use for it 
Two sticks ,COMMA you can go with it .PERIOD thanks 
It's a combination of that ,COMMA the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well ,COMMA as the fact that they protected ,COMMA the contents 
And it's going to change as i go through it 
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when richard got the whole thing started .PERIOD thank you very much .PERIOD richard .PERIOD it's been a big ,COMMA enjoyable part of my life coming here .PERIOD 
And so it was great fun in those days .PERIOD and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients 
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth ,COMMA and we'd put it on the conference table ,COMMA and we'd pull off the black cloth ,COMMA and everybody would ooh and ah ,COMMA 
That was a really good time 
But something's happened in the last 18 years since richard started ted .PERIOD and that's that people like us -- i know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time .PERIOD but for us ,COMMA we've really just started ,COMMA we've kind of climbed maslow's hierarchy a little bit -- and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design ,COMMA human-centeredness in an approach to design 
And i think you're starting to see that ,COMMA and it's making our job ,COMMA even more enjoyable 
And so ,COMMA in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship ,COMMA 
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses ,COMMA as opposed to them being empty 
So you can see what you look like from the back ,COMMA or all the way around ,COMMA as you look 
This is cbs sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago ,COMMA 
And my favorite feature ,COMMA which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment .PERIOD and then when you come back ,COMMA it comes up to greet you happy to see you 
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it as well as wastewater 
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful 
It can dive to 500 feet to where sunlight does not penetrate and is equipped with powerful lights .PERIOD 
(narrator ,COMMA and this central box connects the whole system together 
And so by doing that ,COMMA the woman that you saw in the first thing -- she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college ,COMMA and she's going to be able to do it ,COMMA because of these things 
As in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently the marriage suffered a setback in 1965 when the husband was killed by the wife ,COMMA 
We can't see into the engine room 
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz ,COMMA and there is only energy ,COMMA and you can't see energy 
Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness ,COMMA she turns it to her advantage 
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in 
So one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand 
But we can't read each other's minds .PERIOD i find that quite astonishing 
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist 
And this is increasingly peculiar ,COMMA because about 20 years ago ,COMMA when they started delving into the genome ,COMMA they thought it would probably contain around 100000 genes 
You can't see these things ,COMMA but they are very strange 
Because that's where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are 
This is fascinating ,COMMA you probably know some of you that cells are continually renewed ,COMMA you can see it in skin .PERIOD and this kind of stuff 
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point ,COMMA 
Livers and internal organs ,COMMA sort of take a bit longer ,COMMA a spine takes several years 
There is so many things that -- light ,COMMA 
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies with the naked eye ,COMMA and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight .PERIOD 
What the others are here for i've no idea 
So we were thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books 
Now ,COMMA the problem is ,COMMA there's an x-axis for that ,COMMA which is the practical axis 
This is extremely practical ,COMMA but not so awesome ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA again ,COMMA we kind of caved in .PERIOD and we did the very practical approach ,COMMA which was a bit less awesome ,COMMA 
We said ,COMMA well ,COMMA instead of releasing the full text .PERIOD we're going to release statistics about the books 
It's four words we call that a four-gram 
Well ,COMMA which one should i use 
As of about six months ago ,COMMA the state of the art in this field is that you would ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair .PERIOD and you'd say ,COMMA steve ,COMMA you're an expert on the irregular verbs 
So if you want to become famous early on ,COMMA you should be an actor ,COMMA because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s -- you're still young .PERIOD it's really great 
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician 
Here's a simple way to do it 
So ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA here -- this suppression index is for 5000 people picked in english books ,COMMA where there's no known suppression -- it would be like this ,COMMA basically tightly centered on one 
What you expect is basically what you observe 
But much more importantly ,COMMA the distribution is much wider 
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture 
There's various types of frustration 
This person studies all the arghs ,COMMA from one through eight a's 
These all happen to be on our computers on computers across the world ,COMMA 
And when that happens ,COMMA that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture 
One of them is pattern recognition 
We listen to differences ,COMMA we discount sounds that remain the same 
Why did i say that 
Well ,COMMA there are a lot of reasons for this 
And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously ,COMMA i think -- by personal broadcasting ,COMMA 
And only without conscious listening can these things happen -- a world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA 
It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening 
So mundane sounds can be really interesting .PERIOD if you pay attention 
You can use this in listening in communication ,COMMA 
Why is it not taught ?QUESTIONMARK it's crazy 
Thank you for listening to me today ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what happened was when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in '79 ,COMMA i decided -- i went to work for intel ,COMMA and i was in the computer industry -- and three months into that ,COMMA i fell in love with something else .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA i made the wrong career choice here ,COMMA and i fell in love with brains 
We are in the pre-paradigm days ,COMMA if you want to use thomas .PERIOD kuhn 
And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences 
You're more complicated than your brain .PERIOD you've got a brain 
That's always been the case .PERIOD and so all we can say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my neocortex ,COMMA which is the part of the brain .PERIOD i'm interested in has 30 billion cells .PERIOD 
The best minds were stumped -- really ,COMMA really smart people 
It just turns out ,COMMA it's really hard to think of things ,COMMA but once you've thought of them ,COMMA it's kind of easy to understand it 
So it was intuitive and obvious .PERIOD now ,COMMA what about evolution 
And i'm going to work you through this in a few slides here .PERIOD give you an example of what this means .PERIOD here's a system 
And alan turing defined ,COMMA the turing test ,COMMA which is essentially saying ,COMMA we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human 
A behavioral metric of what intelligence is ,COMMA and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time ,COMMA 
You're not aware of this ,COMMA but your eyes are always moving 
It's not always true ,COMMA but in general ,COMMA there's not a good history of theory in biology ,COMMA 
Not like computer memory ,COMMA it's not at all like computer memory 
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence 
If you don't build it ,COMMA you don't understand it .PERIOD so one more slide here 
The new brain is actually kind of easier than the old brain .PERIOD 
But ultimately ,COMMA the world's the limit here 
I don't know how this is going to turn out 
They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the internet and all this kind of stuff 
I do not think about what i consider to be peace ,COMMA which is sustainable peace with justice and equality 
But he's offering 84 billion dollars for the modernizing of nuclear weapons .PERIOD 
In global terms ,COMMA it's a little bit of money 
But it's going to modernize weapons we do not need ,COMMA and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime ,COMMA unless we get up off our 
I was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago and his holiness -- we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city ,COMMA and there were about eight of us nobel laureates 
We're staring at everybody waiting our turn to speak ,COMMA and he leans over to me ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA jody .PERIOD i'm a buddhist monk .PERIOD 
I spoke with aung sun suu kyi ,COMMA a couple of days ago ,COMMA 
She said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have a long road to go to finally get democracy in my country ,COMMA 
Here's another woman hero of mine 
She says the airports of the world 
They call her the tree lady ,COMMA but she's more than the tree lady .PERIOD 
This is rigoberta menchu tum 
It's not a dirty word 
It's hard work every single day 
And then when she closed the door ,COMMA grandma said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no 
And they also when they want to travel ,COMMA they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations 
And they want the washing machine 
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ?QUESTIONMARK what is special with this 
And over there ,COMMA they don't even use one each 
What are the trends ?QUESTIONMARK if we just prolong the trends ,COMMA without any real advanced analysis to 2050 ,COMMA there are two things that can increase the energy use 
And these 22 units -- still the richest people use most of it 
They must change behavior in some way 
They must also start to produce green energy ,COMMA much more green energy ,COMMA 
I was like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that's social skill .PERIOD 
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon ,COMMA and you watch the kids come out ,COMMA and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks 
Another finding is that the unconscious far from being dumb and sexualized ,COMMA is actually quite smart 
And the way you should do that is study the furniture ,COMMA let it marinate in your mind ,COMMA distract yourself ,COMMA and then a few days later ,COMMA go with your gut ,COMMA because unconsciously you've figured it out 
Now i'm a middle-aged guy 
They put them into a brain scan machine -- this is apocryphal by the way ,COMMA but i don't care -- and they had them watch a horror movie ,COMMA and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives 
They have trouble relating to other people 
Ninety-five percent of our professors report that they are above-average teachers 
They have epistemological modesty 
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity 
The third trait is metis ,COMMA what we might call street smarts -- it's a greek word ,COMMA 
And that comes in tremendously handy ,COMMA because groups are smarter than individuals ,COMMA 
What picasso did ?QUESTIONMARK for example ,COMMA was take the concept ,COMMA western art .PERIOD and the concept african masks and blend them together -- not only the geometry ,COMMA but the moral systems entailed in them 
And these are skills again ,COMMA we can't count and measure 
Just to let you know ,COMMA i do not have a lexicographical whistle .PERIOD 
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary and keep the bad words out 
And it's not very fun .PERIOD and when parts of your job are not easy or fun ,COMMA you kind of look for an excuse not to do them 
But why do people want me to direct traffic when i would much rather go fishing 
Why do i blame the queen 
So he's really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today 
I mean ,COMMA i'm a huge geek .PERIOD i love computers 
It's steampunk what we have is an electric velocipede .PERIOD 
Online dictionaries must be different .PERIOD 
This is flat .PERIOD look how many links there are in the actual entry .PERIOD two 
So it's not that we have good words and bad words 
Some of my best friends are books 
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer 
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic ,COMMA if we've transcended paper ,COMMA if we are worrying less about control and more about description ,COMMA then we can think of the english language as being this beautiful mobile ,COMMA 
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that's not in the dictionary in it ,COMMA that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's pretty to look at for a while ,COMMA but then it dies 
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers 
I was 15 when i was gang-raped by eight men 
But the rest ,COMMA who succumb into it ,COMMA go through everyday torture ,COMMA 
These are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you 
And we are silent about them 
But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections ,COMMA sexually transmitted infections ,COMMA hiv ,COMMA aids ,COMMA syphilis ,COMMA gonorrhea ,COMMA you name it substance abuse drugs .PERIOD everything under the sun .PERIOD 
And therefore my challenge was to understand ,COMMA how can i get out the power from this pain 
What has been my challenge 
My biggest challenge is society 
It's you and me 
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes .PERIOD 
So i'm just going to grab a chair here .PERIOD 
I had this company that i'd spent 15 years building .PERIOD it's called future .PERIOD it was a magazine ,COMMA publishing company .PERIOD 
It had recently gone public and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars .PERIOD a number .PERIOD i didn't really understand 
The date was february .PERIOD 2000 
I mean it had to right .PERIOD i was in for quite a surprise ,COMMA 
I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day ,COMMA every day for 18 months 
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing .PERIOD 
It's the total brain experience ,COMMA we're going to 
So i will ,COMMA here's the vision for ted 
This is a video prototype 
And they don't react to background .PERIOD sounds 
And we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility 
Soren enters the room pop .PERIOD he goes invisible .PERIOD 
So people would walking into the room ,COMMA and they'd almost ignore it thinking ,COMMA it was some crap ,COMMA laying around 
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down .PERIOD man 
Because if that circle weren't there and the floor was very ,COMMA even it would start to wander about in the space 
That's my colleague ,COMMA he's let it go 
And if it isn't easily gotten ,COMMA we'll go ahead and steal it 
While the carbon dioxide ,COMMA vast quantities of it ,COMMA gigatons ,COMMA goes into the atmosphere ,COMMA where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about 
They've run out of good sites 
Babcock &amp :COLON wilcox :COLON that make nuclear reactors .PERIOD here's an integral fast reactor .PERIOD 
Co2e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to co2 
We have facilities around there ,COMMA you also have a buffer zone .PERIOD that's 17 square kilometers .PERIOD 
And you have the uranium mining ,COMMA that you have to deal with 
There are two nations north korea and israel that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all 
There's plenty of solar and wind 
That's from real data 
Solving the world's problems can be done .PERIOD if you really put your mind to it and use clean renewable energy 
And in the united states senate ,COMMA we need bipartisan support -- only one or two votes are needed -- to move global warming ,COMMA through the senate ,COMMA and this room can help 
The first is be aware of the propaganda 
And i'm you know ,COMMA very much pro that kind of stuff 
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s ,COMMA and i continue to do .PERIOD so now 
Because five years from now ,COMMA it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible ,COMMA disastrous nuclear power .PERIOD 
Your final pitch stewart 
Okay ,COMMA so thank you mark 
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the earth ,COMMA take the people of earth and transition off ,COMMA permanently ,COMMA and that's exciting 
In fact ,COMMA i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy ,COMMA a chance to if you would back up the biosphere ,COMMA 
And if you think about space ,COMMA everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space .PERIOD 
And we knew nothing about going to space 
We went from having literally put alan shepard .PERIOD in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years .PERIOD and the average age of the people that got us .PERIOD there was 26 years old ,COMMA 
The shuttle is ,COMMA costing a billion dollars a launch 
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier ,COMMA we should be allowed to risk 
In fact ,COMMA anyone who says we shouldn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just needs to be put aside ,COMMA because ,COMMA as we go forward ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us 
And in fact ,COMMA the large corporations ,COMMA the governments can't take the risk 
We've got an altitude call of 368000 feet 
Today you can go and experience weightless flights .PERIOD 
Orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station .PERIOD 
That was filmed inside our airplane ,COMMA and so you can now do this 
Let me talk about the other thing i'm excited about 
It may ,COMMA or may not happen ,COMMA but if you put up a prize ,COMMA the beautiful thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a very small maintenance fee .PERIOD and you pay on success 
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself 
We all seem to think that you know ,COMMA if we look down on the ground ,COMMA there's nothing there 
And we use the word nothing 
I told her i couldn't face it ,COMMA because the way the teacher was treating me ,COMMA ridiculing me .PERIOD and using me ,COMMA as an example of failure ,COMMA 
So i told her 
And walked off ,COMMA and i didn't expect that ,COMMA because i expected one of these 
So i'm sitting there thinking 
So i did 
But i thought perhaps the ant won't know ,COMMA it'll probably move in 
And then i sat down and all the ants came along 
It became part of me ,COMMA 
As you can see .PERIOD that's a pinhead 
Now that is called the huf .PERIOD haus 
So i'm thinking ,COMMA mr .PERIOD huf isn't going to be very happy .PERIOD when i told him his house has gone to another into the atmosphere somewhere 
So to cut the story short ,COMMA i decided that i had to go back and do it 
So i found some more ,COMMA and i decided to sort of construct it very ,COMMA very slowly ,COMMA holding my breath working between my heartbeat ,COMMA and making sure everything is leveled 
I noticed that the house was occupied 
So basically ,COMMA i'd completed the house 
So i didn't think he was going to throw bart off 
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air ,COMMA 
But i would never do it to a living fly 
Even though they get on our nerves ,COMMA i would never kill an insect because all creatures ,COMMA great and small -- there is a hymn that says that 
So i have to be very ,COMMA very careful 
My work ,COMMA rough estimate ,COMMA sometimes five six to seven weeks .PERIOD you can't always anticipate 
As you can see ,COMMA there's an aphid fly .PERIOD there 
I remember one time i was doing it ,COMMA and the window was open 
And then she looked at me 
And i cut off a little flake of gold 
Because i had to put the torch on the top 
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold 
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing ,COMMA right 
And that was done with a particle from my shirt 
My point is ,COMMA here ,COMMA people have a choice -- just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono 
Which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the global 
And therefore tradition becomes more important ,COMMA not less important .PERIOD 
We're here ,COMMA we're part of a community ,COMMA sharing out ideas and discussing them 
Art becomes a very important part of our national identity 
We have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists ,COMMA and arabs ,COMMA who are not muslims -- not all arabs are muslims by the way -- but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA it was a new discovery 
Now visual expression is just one form of culture integration ,COMMA 
In a similar way ,COMMA we have created the doha film institute 
Who are you playing 
The doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub ;SEMICOLON katara 
I welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .PERIOD 
And in a saying of the koran ,COMMA which to muslims ,COMMA is god speaking to humanity ,COMMA god says to his prophet muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam ,COMMA including noah ,COMMA including moses ,COMMA including abraham ,COMMA including jesus christ .PERIOD and ending with muhammad -- that we have not sent you o ,COMMA muhammad except as a 'rahmah' ,COMMA except as a source of compassion to humanity .PERIOD 
The esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism .PERIOD or tasawwuf in arabic ,COMMA 
The language differs .PERIOD but the objective is the same 
And therefore ,COMMA for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human ,COMMA in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves .PERIOD the attribute of being of being alive of beingness .PERIOD the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness .PERIOD and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings .PERIOD 
And i believe personally that we're on the verge ,COMMA and that ,COMMA with the presence and help of people like you here ,COMMA we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah 
My story actually began when i was four years old ,COMMA and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah ,COMMA georgia .PERIOD 
That's why they were called ape hangers .PERIOD 
And one afternoon ,COMMA i got a call from my doctor .PERIOD 
The next day ,COMMA i came to see him .PERIOD i was like doctor that was a really good joke .PERIOD 
I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives .PERIOD i wrote these men 
Linda ,COMMA my wife ,COMMA joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals 
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle 
Will you help be their dad 
And i got to the end -- he was crying ,COMMA and i was crying -- and then he looked at me ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA 
And as he talked ,COMMA he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says ,COMMA let's go cow tipping .PERIOD even though we never did tip the cow ,COMMA even though no one tips the cow ,COMMA even though cows don't sleep standing up 
And then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon dr .PERIOD john healey ,COMMA at memorial .PERIOD sloan-kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium 
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover .PERIOD all of the extraneous parts of their body 
When my wife and i had kids ,COMMA we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck 
Instead it was everybody running the other way .PERIOD 
And there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me 
Now david is my literary agent 
So one day near the end of my journey ,COMMA i said ,COMMA come on girls .PERIOD let's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge ,COMMA 
We set out on crutches ,COMMA 
And yet ,COMMA for the four million years humans have been walking upright ,COMMA the act is essentially unchanged .PERIOD 
As my physical therapist likes to say ,COMMA every step is a tragedy ,COMMA waiting to happen 
You go slow ,COMMA you get where you're going ,COMMA but you get there with this community you built along the way 
So i stand here today as you see now walking without crutches or a cane 
And last week i had my 18-month scans 
And all the collective minds in this room ,COMMA i dare say can never find a solution for scan-xiety 
I feel that i've fitted in in many ways to some of the things that i've heard 
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that's clean a world that isn't contaminated a world that isn't polluted 
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA my real field of expertise lies in an even different kind of civilization -- i can't really call it a civilization .PERIOD 
And i propose to bring into this ted conference ,COMMA as i always do around the world ,COMMA the voice of the animal kingdom 
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives -- but they have this long childhood ,COMMA five years of suckling and sleeping with the mother ,COMMA and then another three ,COMMA four or five years of emotional dependence on her even when the next child is born ,COMMA 
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity ,COMMA so we've only done 40 years in the wild ,COMMA so far 
We know that chimpanzees ,COMMA and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- self ,COMMA as opposed to other 
They're disappearing for the reasons that all of you in this room know ,COMMA only too .PERIOD well ,COMMA 
And people will pay more for bush-meat ,COMMA as it's called than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred 
We can talk about the distant past plan for the distant future ,COMMA discuss ideas with each other ,COMMA so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group 
And that's not just in the far-away developing world .PERIOD that's everywhere 
Somebody said that yesterday 
And roots and shoots is a program for hope .PERIOD 
See the brick walls as all the problems that we've inflicted on this planet 
It isn't something that their parents tell them or their teachers ,COMMA tell them 
That's effective ,COMMA but if they decide themselves ,COMMA we want to clean this river and put the fish back that used to be there 
No violence ,COMMA no bombs ,COMMA no guns .PERIOD 
How many more minutes two one 
And it's been so clear how much you all care about trying to make this world ,COMMA a better place ,COMMA 
It's very encouraging 
And we've talked a lot about that 
And then as i went around the country after that and felt the fear -- the fear that was leading to people feeling ,COMMA they couldn't worry about the environment .PERIOD any more in case they seemed not to be patriotic -- and i was trying to encourage them .PERIOD somebody came up with a little quotation from mahatma gandhi .PERIOD if you look back through human history ,COMMA you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good 
And just after that ,COMMA a woman brought me this little bell ,COMMA and i want to end on this note 
It's in our hands 
If we lead lives where we consciously leave the lightest possible ecological footprints ,COMMA if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy and don't buy the things that are not .PERIOD we can change the world overnight 
In the laboratory ,COMMA what we want to do is much the same ,COMMA but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity ,COMMA but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .PERIOD 
This is how we can start to make a protocell 
As you know ,COMMA when you put oil and water together ,COMMA they don't mix but through self-assembly ,COMMA we can get a nice oil droplet to form .PERIOD and we can actually use this as a body for our artificial organism ,COMMA or for our protocell ,COMMA as you will see ,COMMA later ,COMMA 
This structure ,COMMA then can organize the formation of a membrane boundary around itself ,COMMA so it can make a body of liquid molecules around itself .PERIOD and that's shown in green here on this micrograph 
It's actually quite lifeless .PERIOD once it forms .PERIOD it doesn't really do anything 
So some things that are missing is ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you had a flow of energy through a system ,COMMA what we'd want is a protocell that can harvest some of that energy ,COMMA in order to maintain itself ,COMMA much like living systems .PERIOD do 
So i add some food source to the system 
So then we put these protocells together in a single experiment to see what they would do .PERIOD and depending on the conditions ,COMMA we have some protocells on the left that are moving around .PERIOD and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment .PERIOD 
So then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times ,COMMA and one time something very interesting happened 
So since we can make some interesting protocells that we like interesting colors and interesting behaviors ,COMMA and they're very easy to make ,COMMA and they have interesting lifelike properties .PERIOD perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth .PERIOD perhaps these represent an easily accessible step .PERIOD one of the first steps ,COMMA by which life got started on the early earth ,COMMA 
They look really good ,COMMA very nice movement ,COMMA and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other similar to what we've seen before -- but again ,COMMA working with just primordial conditions ,COMMA no ,COMMA pure chemicals 
They're even better models of environmental health ,COMMA because not only the same mammalian biology ,COMMA but they share your diet ,COMMA largely 
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water ,COMMA which was interesting 
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though there's about two or three fire hydrants on every city block 
They flatten a few plants .PERIOD no big deal .PERIOD they'll regenerate 
That 99 percent of the time when a firetruck is not parking there ,COMMA it's infiltrating pollutants 
So these are small actions that can amount to a significant effect to improve local environmental health ,COMMA 
Here's one of them that we have up now 
When a fish swims underneath ,COMMA a light goes on 
This is what it looks like 
So there's another function on here 
And they text back 
In this case ,COMMA instead of throwing chewing gum or doritos ,COMMA or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there's a body of water in iceland that i've been dealing with .PERIOD that's in the middle of the city ,COMMA and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution ,COMMA it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds 
They're cross-species delicious .PERIOD that is delicious for humans and non-humans .PERIOD 
And you say boy ,COMMA that's a lot 
But you know what 
Now if you parked those end to end and wrapped them around the earth that would stretch around the earth 125 times 
And we wanted to take advantage of moore's law with electronic controls and software ,COMMA and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected 
So let me talk about hydrogen .PERIOD first ,COMMA 
The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources .PERIOD it can come from fossil fuels .PERIOD it can come from any way that you can create electricity ,COMMA including renewables .PERIOD 
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid 
And we talked about swarm networks earlier 
Actually the theme of this conference ,COMMA i think has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off -- and that's relationships and working together .PERIOD 
I just want to ask one 
We're into this over a billion dollars already ,COMMA so i would hope people would think we're serious .PERIOD when we're spending that kind of money 
In oxford ,COMMA perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass .PERIOD that is new york city to try and see our true selves ,COMMA or perhaps pass through to another world .PERIOD 
My colleagues ,COMMA and i have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project 
And i'd like to tell you the story in three acts .PERIOD and if i have time still ,COMMA an epilogue 
It was once a beach ,COMMA and this painting has john james audubon .PERIOD the painter sitting on the rock .PERIOD 
Or this painting ,COMMA from the 1740s ,COMMA from greenwich village 
Here's bowling green ?QUESTIONMARK and here's broadway 
And just beyond it ,COMMA you can see features that have vanished .PERIOD things that have disappeared .PERIOD 
Or murray hill .PERIOD and this is the murrays' house on murray hill .PERIOD 200 years ago ,COMMA 
And i thought to myself ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if i could georeference this map ,COMMA if i could place this map in the grid of the city today ,COMMA i could find these lost features of the city ,COMMA in the block-by-block geography that people know ,COMMA the geography of where people go to work ,COMMA and where they go to live ,COMMA and where they like to eat 
Then if we added maps like the geology ,COMMA the bedrock geology and the surface geology ,COMMA what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map ,COMMA with the 17 soil classes that are defined by the national conservation service if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were .PERIOD then we can calculate the slopes 
We can calculate the aspect 
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds 
We compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape 
And the old fields ,COMMA the successional fields that go 
It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity 
As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver 
An aspen needs fire and dry soils .PERIOD 
But what are the conditions that make it possible 
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses ,COMMA the butterflies ,COMMA the fish in the stream ,COMMA the birds in the trees ,COMMA 
And perhaps a black bear walked by ,COMMA and maybe native americans were there 
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii ,COMMA 
We can see the fields that the native americans made 
So when you're watching law and order and the lawyers walk up the steps ,COMMA they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house ,COMMA right into the collect pond .PERIOD 400 years ago ,COMMA 
And i think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future .PERIOD 
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity .PERIOD 
Fill in the blanks ,COMMA 
Unfortunately ,COMMA while this society is without a doubt ,COMMA the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created ,COMMA it's got some major major flaws 
Clearly we don't have 10 planets 
And they may not want to live exactly like us 
You know .PERIOD so ,COMMA on the one hand we have the unthinkable .PERIOD on the other hand we have the unimaginable 
You know what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools models and ideas ,COMMA which if widely adopted would change the game 
Here ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is vancouver ,COMMA which if you haven't been there ,COMMA you ought to go for a visit .PERIOD it's a fabulous city 
But once you also have people living in close proximity to each other .PERIOD one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places 
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world 
All throughout the developing world ,COMMA people are going directly to cell phones .PERIOD skipping the whole landline stage 
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate ,COMMA you get different kinds of solutions 
And those solutions are accessible in a different way to people who don't have capital right .PERIOD 
It's doing something new ,COMMA there's new things happening 
You have other radical examples where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out 
Another world is possible 
We tweak that a lot 
We're looking a lot at this .PERIOD this is spreading everywhere 
This is from a force more powerful ;SEMICOLON it's a little screenshot .PERIOD 
These are refrigerators that require no electricity .PERIOD they're pot within a pot ,COMMA design 
How do we help people like that 
Audience ,COMMA it detects landmines .PERIOD 
If you are living in one of the places where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered ,COMMA you can fling these seeds out into the field .PERIOD 
And policing copyright violations for children's birthday .PERIOD cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said ,COMMA you know what we're getting out of that business .PERIOD 
If you're an amateur ,COMMA you don't have access to our machine anymore ,COMMA 
So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act 
And the back story is this :COLON sopa and pipa as legislation were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century 
And congress did something 
And that law was called the audio home recording act of 1992 
So ,COMMA when the audio home recording act of 1992 was passed ,COMMA the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if congress was acting in their framework ,COMMA they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment ,COMMA 
It was a complicated piece of legislation ,COMMA a lot of moving parts 
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation 
Every dvd player and game player and television and computer ,COMMA you brought home -- no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it -- could be broken by the content industries .PERIOD if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content 
So this is the internet they have in mind 
Imagine it says ted because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost 
And if you're not an american citizen ,COMMA you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same 
And the dmca goes back to the audio home recording act ,COMMA which horrified those industries 
They just want the sharing to go away 
The whole world is laid out for you .PERIOD the best jobs are laid out for you .PERIOD and you want to go and work in a village 
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college 
You failed in your exam 
The education system in india makes you look at paris and new delhi and zurich ,COMMA what are you doing in this village 
You have to have a dignity of labor 
A traditional midwife is a professional 
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate .PERIOD 
So when i said that they said ,COMMA well ,COMMA show us what is possible ?QUESTIONMARK what are you doing 
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men 
It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified 
So long as the sun shines ,COMMA we'll have no problem with power .PERIOD 
And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking 
She looks after 20 goats in the morning ,COMMA but she's prime minister in the evening 
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening 
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high ,COMMA we use puppetry .PERIOD 
Why because they want to leave the village and go to a city ,COMMA looking for a job 
Comes back goes into the village says ,COMMA well ,COMMA what's the story 
They said these ,COMMA two grandmothers grandmothers .PERIOD the minister couldn't believe what was happening 
Went straight to the president 
So he summoned me and said ,COMMA can you train me ?QUESTIONMARK 150 grandmothers ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA she is very beautiful .PERIOD 
And when i went back six months later ,COMMA i said ,COMMA where's your husband 
Don't listen to the world bank ,COMMA listen to the people on the ground .PERIOD 
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information 
For artists ,COMMA we're making new worlds that we can uncover and explore 
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration ,COMMA 
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head 
A system of cognitive processes ,COMMA largely non-conscious cognitive processes ,COMMA that help them change their views of the world ,COMMA so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves 
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ,COMMA 
Some of you are old enough to remember ,COMMA he was the chairman of the house of representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found out about a shady book deal ,COMMA he had done 
So he went to find them ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we can give you a franchise on this for 3000 bucks 
And finally never ever join the beatles .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA because the experiment i'm going to tell you about uses them .PERIOD these are monet prints .PERIOD 
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia ,COMMA these are hospitalized patients 
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four ,COMMA 
Really jim ,COMMA you don't remember .PERIOD i was just here ,COMMA with the monet prints .PERIOD 
Free aren't you just giving me my own paper 
What are you doing 
They don't like their picture .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA even after the opportunity to swap has expired ,COMMA they still don't like their picture .PERIOD why 
We could do it ,COMMA so that when you take the two pictures ,COMMA you'd have four days to change your mind ,COMMA or we're doing ,COMMA another course where you take the two pictures ,COMMA and you make up your mind right away .PERIOD and you can never change it ,COMMA which course would you like to be in 
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you -- esther ,COMMA my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of atlanta .PERIOD 
There's a historical marker 
I guess i must 
Oh jesus 
Puts it in reverse .PERIOD fifty-five out of the driveway ,COMMA in reverse 
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door ,COMMA you know what i'm talking about 
And there she goes ,COMMA right 
Ok ,COMMA so i stopped at a light ,COMMA and there's a guy ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the back 
Now ,COMMA you have all been at a mall during the holidays .PERIOD yes ,COMMA 
It will upset .PERIOD you 
Look the chevy -- he's coming ,COMMA this way ,COMMA 
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid ,COMMA you were an adult -- you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone 
Of course ,COMMA her comeback is when have i embarrassed you 
A brevity ,COMMA brevity of everything with this child 
But she pauses occasionally and says ,COMMA how do you spell that what year ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
When she writes the expose in about 20 years ,COMMA don't believe a word of it 
But this is my daughter ,COMMA lauren my remarkable daughter .PERIOD my borderline asperger's kid 
She says ,COMMA ma ,COMMA you got to look 
Now when this kid says ,COMMA i got to look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
Oh jesus ,COMMA oh jesus 
I finally ,COMMA come -- and now ,COMMA it's the south 
We want to curl up and say ,COMMA tell it to me ,COMMA tell it to me 
I'm with the little lady damn ,COMMA 
After i say -- let me ,COMMA refresh you -- have you no shame 
With her is a young man -- husband ,COMMA brother ,COMMA lover .PERIOD it's not my job 
They turn then shoulder to shoulder and walk away ,COMMA lost in their own reverie 
And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .PERIOD 
Voices ?QUESTIONMARK woohoo ?QUESTIONMARK yeah !EXCLAMATIONMARK nice ?QUESTIONMARK 
What are catastrophic effects ,COMMA a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction .PERIOD 
But now i'll talk about some more pleasant things 
How fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car 
Where can i go today ?QUESTIONMARK and who can i do it with 
It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads 
In london the day they turned the congestion pricing on there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight .PERIOD and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing ,COMMA 
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates ,COMMA 
And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes 
And if we have it ,COMMA you'll decide how many miles to drive ,COMMA what mode of travel where to live and work 
Again all mesh-enabled monthly communication cost zero 
They're resilient their redundancy is built into this fabulous ,COMMA decentralized design 
These things are going to happen 
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen ,COMMA 
And if i had my druthers ,COMMA we would have an open-source version ,COMMA in addition to open standards 
When i went this morning to larry brilliant's tedtalk ,COMMA prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks to make all that happen .PERIOD 
So the awesome story ,COMMA it begins about 40 years ago ,COMMA when my mom and my dad came to canada ,COMMA 
My dad left a small village outside of amritsar .PERIOD india 
And they got here in the late 1960s 
We grew up taking for granted a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted when they grew up -- things like power ,COMMA always on in our houses ,COMMA things like schools across the street and hospitals down the road and popsicles in the backyard .PERIOD 
So you can't actually see them ,COMMA but it was breathtaking .PERIOD believe me 
My marriage wasn't going well ,COMMA and we just were growing further and further apart 
One day my wife came home from work and summoned the courage ,COMMA through a lot of tears to have a very honest conversation ,COMMA 
And as these dark clouds were circling me ,COMMA and i was finding it really ,COMMA really difficult to think of anything good .PERIOD i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA 
And nobody read it ,COMMA except for my mom ,COMMA 
Flash-forward to the next year ,COMMA and the book of awesome ,COMMA has now been number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks .PERIOD 
But look ,COMMA i said ,COMMA i wanted to do three things with you today ,COMMA 
It's sad ,COMMA and it's not pleasant to talk about ,COMMA but your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat ,COMMA your headaches might be more serious than you thought ,COMMA or your dog could get hit by a car on the street .PERIOD 
And there are times in life ,COMMA when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart .PERIOD and when that bad news washes over you ,COMMA and when that pain sponges and soaks in ,COMMA i just really hope you feel like you've always got two choices .PERIOD 
Because you all used to be three years old ,COMMA 
That three-year-old girl is still part of you 
These were four guys on the la rams in the 1960s ,COMMA you did not want to go up against 
I'd like to pause my tedtalk for about 10 seconds right now ,COMMA because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this .PERIOD and my parents are sitting in the front row 
He would say ,COMMA look can you believe they have a mango here from mexico 
You can sleep in clean sheets 
The cashiers at your grocery store ,COMMA the foreman at your plant ,COMMA the guy tailgating you home on the highway .PERIOD the telemarketer calling you during dinner ,COMMA every teacher you've ever had everyone that's ever woken up beside you every politician ,COMMA in every country ,COMMA every actor in every movie ,COMMA every single person in your family ,COMMA everyone you love everyone in this room ,COMMA and you will be dead in a hundred years .PERIOD 
Thank you 
Dan ,COMMA rather ,COMMA since the september 11th attack on the world trade center ,COMMA many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground 
Now as cbs's ,COMMA jim axelrod reports ,COMMA they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene 
There's a new place in new york ,COMMA where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero 
This is ours 
David rockwell ,COMMA the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site .PERIOD but as this incredibly moving burial ground 
The walls are bare by design ,COMMA so people can fill them with their own .PERIOD memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter .PERIOD 
Your work is highly sensual .PERIOD even hedonistic .PERIOD 
But i've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that 
We were really paralyzed 
And in discussing this with other architects ,COMMA we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them .PERIOD 50 stories ,COMMA taller ,COMMA 
It was predominantly a white ,COMMA rich corporate group that was not representative of the city .PERIOD 
And i think this was the 21st ,COMMA and we knew this had to be built ,COMMA and up by the 28th 
In fact ,COMMA it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding ,COMMA 
And i've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together ,COMMA watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site ,COMMA 
No ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA i told the contractor to go ahead 
I think this is obviously substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before ,COMMA just by the nature of it ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA i think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate -- i think right now .PERIOD the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .PERIOD 
I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 ,COMMA or 70 ,COMMA or 80 thousand new office spaces ,COMMA regardless of what the number is .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA there's a proposal on the table now ,COMMA for building number seven ,COMMA 
Right which the towers fell into 
And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .PERIOD 
This small foundation ,COMMA we put together is looking for other ways to help 
So i thought that would be good to end with 
One of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was 
And essentially our structure was designed to be written on 
As you say ,COMMA it's not a memorial .PERIOD 
But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection ,COMMA and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary -- i don't know if beauty is the word -- but presence 
So a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant ,COMMA world-class neuropsychologist .PERIOD i had a baby 
Sorry ,COMMA ted 
Because this is what i do .PERIOD this is what i teach 
So look to the right-hand side of the screen 
Would it be crazy to know ,COMMA 103 gs .PERIOD 
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play cleared for return to play applies to them 
If god forbid any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion .PERIOD most of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks 
Should your kid play football .PERIOD i don't know 
The first study up 
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- co kids with brain injury .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK this epiphany of tom's 
Thank you 
This is ,COMMA but one ,COMMA this is frank gehry ,COMMA the architect's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi ,COMMA 
So my first topic with respect to this was not death ,COMMA but obesity 
So this is a slide of some of our initial results 
How big are the clusters ,COMMA how far do they reach 
This here shows on the y-axis ,COMMA the increase in the probability that a person is obese ,COMMA given that a social contact of theirs is obese ,COMMA and on the x-axis ,COMMA the degrees of separation between the two people 
And the next bar over ,COMMA the [red] line ,COMMA says ,COMMA if your friend's friends are obese ,COMMA your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher 
There are at least three possibilities .PERIOD one possibility is that as i gain weight ,COMMA it causes you to gain weight 
Another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight ,COMMA and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is 
Now i want to be very clear .PERIOD we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all 
And by the end ,COMMA you're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .PERIOD 
And so this function of emotions suggests that ,COMMA in addition to any other purpose they serve ,COMMA they're a kind of primitive form of communication .PERIOD 
And whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch ,COMMA 
So this work with emotions ,COMMA which are so fundamental ,COMMA then got us to thinking about ,COMMA maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes 
Well ,COMMA the striking patterns of human social networks ,COMMA their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place ,COMMA and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure ,COMMA 
And finally ,COMMA compare nodes c and d .PERIOD c and d .PERIOD both have six friends 
But now we with a bird's eye view looking at this network can see that they occupy very different social worlds .PERIOD 
So different structural locations have different implications for your life .PERIOD 
They are a kind of social capital 
New properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks ,COMMA and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks ,COMMA not just in the individuals ,COMMA within them 
They're both made of carbon ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite ,COMMA which is soft and dark 
If i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs ,COMMA you would cut the ties to me .PERIOD and the network would disintegrate ,COMMA 
I'd never seen anything like that ,COMMA 
But after seeing what i've seen the truth is ,COMMA they have not disappeared at all 
And this is happening every day ,COMMA 
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages ,COMMA with cheap webcams ,COMMA lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow .PERIOD 
And you let it go and then right ,COMMA when you see the tail ,COMMA you grab it by the tail .PERIOD then you bring it back in 
You know ,COMMA you create power then you tame it 
According to the treaty ,COMMA those lands are a sovereign nation .PERIOD 
1868 the second fort laramie treaty ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA guarantees ,COMMA the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakotas' ownership of the sacred black hills .PERIOD 
A new agreement was presented to sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as sell or starve sign the paper or no food for your tribe .PERIOD 
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections and distributed to individual indians with the surplus disposed of 
Tribes lost millions of acres 
To this day ,COMMA this is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle .PERIOD 
Unemployment on the pine ridge indian reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent .PERIOD 
This is how we came to own these united states ,COMMA 
And how much of this history do you need to own ,COMMA even 
Because the solution seems so far in the past ,COMMA i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .PERIOD 
That's why there's a glass of water up there 
This solution has been called by some potentially the most important medical advance .PERIOD this century 
And what it was was oral rehydration salts ,COMMA 
Maybe there's a biological answer 
See we spent a lot of energy in many domains -- technological ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA hard ,COMMA work ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA human ingenuity -- to crack important ,COMMA social problems ,COMMA with technology solutions .PERIOD 
Here i have a bunch of other examples all suffer from the last mile problem .PERIOD 
The last mile is everywhere ,COMMA problematic 
The problem is ,COMMA this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears 
They do lots of inconsistent things .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years ,COMMA ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .PERIOD 
So think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake 
So here you all are ,COMMA ostensibly educated people 
Most of you look smart ,COMMA 
I think we've learned the answer to that .PERIOD here 
Almost out of kindergarten ,COMMA 
These models ,COMMA like the leaky bucket ,COMMA work well in most situations .PERIOD 
They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality 
So now ,COMMA while you're thinking about that ,COMMA let's move to a second task ,COMMA 
Fifty versus 35 ,COMMA that's a big move .PERIOD eleven versus nine come on 
So far ,COMMA i've been pretty negative 
You just gotta carry this thing around ,COMMA 
Here's another example of this 
This is from a company called positive energy .PERIOD 
And what they find is just this letter .PERIOD nothing else has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use 
We have testing ,COMMA we go to the lab ,COMMA we try it .PERIOD again ,COMMA we have refinement 
So this whole area is so fascinating 
How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground ,COMMA in indian villages .PERIOD for example ,COMMA 
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity ,COMMA or nonprofits that have operational capacity .PERIOD 
If you have biological problems ,COMMA we try and fix it ,COMMA see ,COMMA if it works ,COMMA and then work the scale 
When the magazine -- actually ,COMMA when i got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages ,COMMA 
If it's -- see it for a long enough time ,COMMA i actually do something about it 
Thank you so much 
Well ,COMMA now ,COMMA if i take that sugar dough ,COMMA the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity ,COMMA 
We call this our sushi circuit .PERIOD it's very popular with kids 
I plug in again ,COMMA the power to it 
I can start plugging in lots of lights 
We've got some videos you can make them yourselves 
We've had a mom in utah ,COMMA who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the uk and curriculum developers in hawaii 
Up don't move the wrist over the heart .PERIOD don't move the wrist .PERIOD 
And then look at me 
Good nice ,COMMA and you can sit over there 
Which one shall have a good poker hand .PERIOD 
This guy beats them with four of a kind ,COMMA or deuce -- deuce .PERIOD 
No reaction that with even -- ok ,COMMA and this 
These look in order ,COMMA i'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven .PERIOD and 
Such life right 
Now if you are interested ,COMMA i will demonstrate some underground techniques 
Right you agree 
Ok ,COMMA 
So -- because if you look now ,COMMA i can still see it 
Come to -- no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no 
When i'm sober ,COMMA i do this much quicker ,COMMA but we will check 
Pardon ,COMMA but then when we will have it back ,COMMA you do this 
Perfect 
Please name any card anyone 
My fault .PERIOD don't applaud .PERIOD this was clubs .PERIOD 
But now i do it the regular speed ,COMMA right 
Excellent 
And queen of hearts ,COMMA yes ,COMMA 
So now a false count 
Right sorry ,COMMA my -- i should have mentioned that yeah ,COMMA 
Yeah ,COMMA good 
I liked it now a little more difficult 
You see ,COMMA i don't work with prestige .PERIOD so always do mistakes .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four -- yes ,COMMA the camera got it :COLON five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight -- ah -- nine ,COMMA 10 ,COMMA the jack ,COMMA jack of spades .PERIOD queen of -- i like that laugh ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD queen .PERIOD 
There was the place ,COMMA and here is king of spades .PERIOD correct 
Ah ,COMMA this is tough 
Maybe it's important -- yeah -- nine of diamonds ,COMMA ok .PERIOD 
And i give you a diamonds .PERIOD so they -- so you put them here in a nice row ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and you can see ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA good .PERIOD 
You're peeking .PERIOD you just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back 
We will try 
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet 
I see some of you recognize this child 
At that point ,COMMA they usually give up 
And the 10-year-old on every eight notes 
It can be the other buttock ,COMMA 
These are the people who never listen to classical music 
You couldn't tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome 
Of course ,COMMA i'm not sure they'll be up to it .PERIOD 
Do you know what i think probably happened in this room 
And for the rest of your life ,COMMA every time you hear classical music ,COMMA you'll always be able to know .PERIOD if you hear those impulses .PERIOD 
Do you remember ,COMMA hamlet act ,COMMA one scene ,COMMA three .PERIOD he finds out that his uncle killed .PERIOD his father 
No otherwise the play would be over stupid 
Now ,COMMA he tries the e again .PERIOD that chord doesn't work 
And i've one last request before i play this piece ,COMMA all the way through 
And i did exactly what i did with you ,COMMA and i told them and explained them ,COMMA and the whole thing 
Now ,COMMA how would you walk -- because you know ,COMMA my profession ,COMMA the music profession doesn't see it that way 
People in my orchestra came up to me and said ,COMMA ben ,COMMA what happened ?QUESTIONMARK that's what happened 
Who am i being that my children's eyes are not shining 
I learned this from a woman who survived auschwitz ,COMMA one of the rare survivors ,COMMA 
And she told me this ,COMMA she said ,COMMA we were in the train going to auschwitz ,COMMA and i looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing 
Thank you 
Here's what he did .PERIOD he gathered his participants 
If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today ,COMMA you get 20 dollars 
But for a lot of tasks ,COMMA they actually either don't work or often they do harm 
If you look at the science ,COMMA there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does 
But for 21st century tasks ,COMMA that mechanistic ,COMMA reward-and-punishment approach doesn't work .PERIOD often doesn't work and often does harm .PERIOD 
Same deal you ,COMMA we're timing for norms .PERIOD 
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper 
The rules are mystifying .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA but one the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill .PERIOD a larger reward led to poorer performance .PERIOD 
People offered the medium level of rewards did no better than people offered the small rewards 
In eight of the nine tasks ,COMMA we examined across three experiments .PERIOD higher incentives led to worse performance 
Last month just last month ,COMMA economists at lse ,COMMA looked at 51 studies of pay-for-performance plans ,COMMA inside of companies 
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does 
Purpose ,COMMA the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves 
Traditional notions of management are great .PERIOD if you want compliance 
A few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want as long as it's not part of your regular job 
And then being australians everybody has a beer 
That one day of intense autonomy has produced a whole array of software fixes that might never have existed 
They have autonomy over their time ,COMMA their task ,COMMA their team ,COMMA their technique 
Autonomy ,COMMA mastery and purpose versus carrot and sticks ,COMMA and who wins 
Three ,COMMA the secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments ,COMMA but that unseen intrinsic drive -- the drive to do things for their own sake .PERIOD 
So this again is on the subject -- a slice from the equator of the earth 
It turns once per day in synchrony with the earth ,COMMA 
This would be grown ,COMMA i suppose ,COMMA with nanotechnology in the future ,COMMA sometime 
So if we could roll the next film here ,COMMA 
This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations 
The idea of this air genie is ,COMMA it's something that can just transform and become anything 
And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this 
Um ,COMMA he was happy .PERIOD 
Let's see somebody else a great conductor 
He's a nice guy .PERIOD he's a really nice guy .PERIOD 
It's not true when he was a young man of about 30 .PERIOD he wrote what he called the ten commandments for conductors 
The first one was ,COMMA if you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong .PERIOD 
Now either he is senile ,COMMA and doesn't remember his own music because he wrote the music 
So no ,COMMA he doesn't want that that's a different kind of control 
Once like a muti ,COMMA and you'll -- -- clap ,COMMA just once 
And then like karajan ,COMMA let's see what happens .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
And when karajan is asked about it ,COMMA he actually says ,COMMA yes ,COMMA the worst damage .PERIOD i can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction 
Well ,COMMA it is different ,COMMA but isn't that controlling in the same way ,COMMA 
Look at the eyes 
And you're playing a painful sound 
Now ,COMMA it's a reversed thing .PERIOD you're telling the story ,COMMA and you're telling the story 
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically ,COMMA looking at the globalized economic growth model ,COMMA and moderating what comes in at one end ,COMMA and moderating the outputs at the other end .PERIOD 
If you could help me with that ,COMMA it would be fantastic 
It's open source ,COMMA it's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .PERIOD 
It's self-organizing ,COMMA there is no great central organization that pushes this .PERIOD people just pick up an idea ,COMMA and they run with it ,COMMA and they implement it where they are .PERIOD 
And it's really about how systems settlements ,COMMA withstand shock from the outside ,COMMA 
When our supermarkets have only two ,COMMA or three days' worth of food in them at any one time ,COMMA often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in 
It's a process ,COMMA which is playful and creative and informative 
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage 
A lot of places are working with their local schools .PERIOD 
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies ,COMMA 
And we see it all over the place as well .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
This is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning 
Many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are 
Now ,COMMA how did we get here 
They make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out 
And california's not unique 
There's ways if it's temporary to minimize the impact ,COMMA but it's a problem 
Well ,COMMA you have to allocate dollars for that system ,COMMA and for that incentive pay 
Well ,COMMA there really is no brain trust 
So what do we need to do 
Whenever they say ,COMMA there's these long-term problems .PERIOD we can't say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're the messenger with bad news 
Now i think this is a solvable problem .PERIOD 
What do i know that would cause me a reticent ,COMMA midwestern scientist to get myself arrested in front of the white house protesting 
Did it mean that venus had an ionosphere 
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide .PERIOD atmosphere 
Its changes will affect all of humanity .PERIOD 
British physicist ,COMMA john tyndall ,COMMA in the 1850's made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation ,COMMA which is heat 
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .PERIOD 
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force 
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first from earth's energy balance and second from earth's climate history .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA finally ,COMMA we can measure earth's energy imbalance ,COMMA precisely by measuring the heat content in earth's heat reservoirs 
The biggest reservoir ,COMMA the ocean was the least well measured until more than 3000 .PERIOD argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean 
Yet there was more energy coming in than going out 
These curves for global temperature ,COMMA atmospheric co2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and antarctic ice cores from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet ,COMMA 
And more co2 causes more warming 
So co2 methane ,COMMA and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge ,COMMA even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak ,COMMA forcing 
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago ,COMMA 
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .PERIOD 
What may be more reprehensible ,COMMA if climate denial continues ,COMMA is extermination of species ,COMMA 
An important impact ,COMMA if global warming continues ,COMMA will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world ,COMMA the midwest and great plains ,COMMA which are expected ,COMMA to become prone to extreme droughts ,COMMA worse than the dust bowl within just a few decades .PERIOD if we let global warming continue 
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation ,COMMA and its solutions more effectively ,COMMA 
A parachute jump from the very edge of space 
What i'd like to do ,COMMA first is take you through a very brief helicopter ride of stunts and the stunts industry in the movies and in television and show you how technology has started to interface with the physical skills of the stunt performer in a way that makes the stunts bigger and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before .PERIOD 
I'm a stunt coordinator and as well as perform stunts .PERIOD i often design them 
What safety they had was very scant 
This is the first stunt woman .PERIOD rosie .PERIOD venger ,COMMA an amazing woman 
Yakima canutt really formed the stunt fight 
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date ,COMMA some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts 
Well ,COMMA we used to use trampettes in the old days .PERIOD that's all they had 
And that's a ramp spring off the thing and fly through the air ,COMMA and hopefully you make it look good ,COMMA 
Now we've got technology .PERIOD this thing is called an air .PERIOD ram .PERIOD 
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology 
That's a long way to fall .PERIOD if you get it wrong ,COMMA that was just about right 
This is a shot of terminator .PERIOD the movie 
It's 30 feet ,COMMA it's water .PERIOD it's very simple 
This guy is not skydiving .PERIOD he's being flown like a kite ,COMMA or moved around like a kite 
It's that shape because the helium has to expand 
Certainly at 100000 feet ,COMMA no aircraft will fly 
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps and two balloons for the main jump ,COMMA because they notoriously tear on takeoff ,COMMA 
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down 
It's hundreds of feet high ,COMMA it's enormous 
It's a three sided box .PERIOD basically 
That's the prototype of the parachute .PERIOD i've now had them custom make one ,COMMA the only one of its kind in the world ,COMMA and that's the only suit of its kind in the world 
Then they're comfortable .PERIOD they have good vision .PERIOD like this great big visor 
And then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down in whatever emergency measures ,COMMA everyone is .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
But if you are ,COMMA and you say to somebody ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they say ,COMMA what do you do 
Like religion and money and other things 
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent .PERIOD and my contention is ,COMMA all kids have tremendous talents ,COMMA 
Thank you very much .PERIOD so 15 minutes left 
And the girl said ,COMMA i'm drawing a picture of god

We had the place crammed full of agents .PERIOD in t-shirts ,COMMA james robinson ,COMMA is joseph ,COMMA 
Anyway ,COMMA the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down .PERIOD and the first boy said ,COMMA i bring you gold 
And the third boy said frank sent this 
They have become frightened of being wrong 
So ,COMMA why is this 
You don't think of shakespeare ,COMMA having a father do you 
Shakespeare being seven ,COMMA i never thought of it .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA he was seven at some point he was in somebody's english class wasn't he how annoying would that be 
And stop speaking like that ,COMMA it's confusing everybody 
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance .PERIOD there isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics .PERIOD why 
We all have bodies ,COMMA don't we did .PERIOD i miss a meeting 
And i like university professors ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .PERIOD 
Benign advice -- now profoundly mistaken the whole world is engulfed in a revolution 
Secondly ,COMMA intelligence is dynamic 
It's really prompted by a conversation ,COMMA i had with a wonderful woman ,COMMA who maybe most people have never heard of .PERIOD she's called gillian lynne -- have you heard of her some have she's a choreographer .PERIOD and everybody knows her work 
I grew up at a time when iconic actors from kuwait syria ,COMMA egypt used laughter .PERIOD to unite the region ,COMMA just as football .PERIOD can 
Also three guys working for years in los angeles ,COMMA an iranian a palestinian and an egyptian created the aptly named axis of evil comedy act .PERIOD 
Who had started a successful new tribe ,COMMA 
I invited our new ceo ,COMMA and as soon as he realized ,COMMA we had a room packed full of laughing infidels .PERIOD his reaction was very simple .PERIOD let's make this happen .PERIOD 
Stay away from bolitics in the middle east 
Now were the axis successful 
Anywhere you go 
We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel 
For inspiration go to one of our festivals ,COMMA go online drop us ,COMMA a line ,COMMA 
As my father likes to call him .PERIOD asheikh azubare ,COMMA as my mother would say ,COMMA shakespeare 
And i'm not a trained academic 
It was very difficult ,COMMA not to get scared .PERIOD not to get daunted 
We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school ,COMMA sent to college and get them prepared for better living a high value job .PERIOD 
That was our first school .PERIOD one hundred sixty-five .PERIOD children 
But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak english .PERIOD well 
Even if it takes me four and a half hours ,COMMA or three and half hours to finish my book ,COMMA i do it

I promise you parusharam will speak in the ted conference a few years from now 
I think i was supposed to talk about my new book ,COMMA which is called blink ,COMMA and it's about snap judgments and first impressions 
So i decided ,COMMA instead ,COMMA i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy ,COMMA as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years ,COMMA a man ,COMMA who is a great personal hero of mine ?QUESTIONMARK someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce 
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago ,COMMA back in the early '70s -- one of his first clients ,COMMA was pepsi 
We'd like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he would think it through and say ,COMMA what was wrong 
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi 
This was his horseradish .PERIOD he was obsessed with it .PERIOD 
You'd have a plate of spaghetti ,COMMA and you would pour it on ,COMMA right 
And of those three facts .PERIOD the third one was the most significant because at the time in the early 1980s ,COMMA if you went to a supermarket ,COMMA you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce 
And prego turned to howard ,COMMA and they said you telling me that one third of americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .PERIOD and yet ,COMMA no one is servicing their needs ?QUESTIONMARK and he said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA 
It's a mystery 
What percentage of you actually ,COMMA like a dark ,COMMA rich ,COMMA hearty roast 
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning 
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard 
And where did that come from it came from italy 
When we talked about authentic tomato sauce .PERIOD in the 1970s ,COMMA we talked about italian tomato sauce .PERIOD we talked about the earliest ragus ,COMMA which had no visible solids ,COMMA right 
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA a and b ,COMMA we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce ,COMMA then they would embrace it 
I guess my cancer different from your cancer 
And for that ,COMMA we owe him a great vote of thanks .PERIOD 
And the example ,COMMA he used was coffee 
But to us ,COMMA he was just dad ,COMMA and our home life was pretty normal 
And i think a lot of people in his day ,COMMA probably thought he was a bit of a kook 
Or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek and newman in boston ,COMMA who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner .PERIOD at howard johnson's -- on route 128 in lexington ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA just two miles from where i was studying the queen's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight &amp .PERIOD the pips ,COMMA singing midnight ,COMMA train to georgia ,COMMA while -- -- in my dad's ,COMMA big ,COMMA easy chair ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
Another one ,COMMA which believes in the pure transparency of content ,COMMA 
These are four very different ways of looking at the world .PERIOD i even gave them names 
And there's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics ,COMMA

The distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny ;SEMICOLON the penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan 9 to nine lives .PERIOD it's all the same 
So i had all these notions .PERIOD this was back in the late '90s ,COMMA and other people in my business thought ,COMMA i was pretty crazy .PERIOD but a lot of people then went on ,COMMA and actually did it 
I just want to get to the last panel 
Talk about your infinite canvas 
Why is this important 
But media provides us with a window back into the world that we live in 
Thank you for having me 
♫ strung in the wind ,COMMA i called you ♫ ♫ but you did not hear ♫ ♫ and you're a plant that needs poor soil .PERIOD ♫ ♫ and i have treated you too well ♫ ♫ to give up flowers ♫ ♫ oh ,COMMA i have been too rich for you ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north ,COMMA i get so cold .PERIOD ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ the sea ,COMMA it freezes over ♫ ♫ to trap the light ♫ ♫ and i'm in love with being in love ♫ ♫ and you were never quite the one ♫ ♫ in gerda's eyes ♫ ♫ fragments of what you've become ♫ ♫ and all the moths that fly at night ♫ ♫ believe electric light is bright ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ,COMMA no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ♫ ♫ i'll believe it ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ farther than the sun from me ♫ ♫ farther than i'd have you be ♫ ♫ and i go north ,COMMA i get so cold .PERIOD ♫ ♫ my heart is lava under stone ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ you are not worthy ♫ ♫ with your calculating eyes ♫ ♫ spinning figures ♫ ♫ you cannot see me ,COMMA no ♫ ♫ and if i tell myself enough ,COMMA i'll believe it .PERIOD ♫ thank you very much .PERIOD 
And as great as these books were you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .PERIOD 
And that's when i discovered comedy 
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world .PERIOD 
Because that's what i take from the theme of this conference gained in translation 
Now i'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that .PERIOD 
Now that's honesty and integrity .PERIOD and it's also why fey's performances left such a lasting impression ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA whether this says ,COMMA more about the conflict between integrity and profitability of corporate journalism than it does about the attentiveness of stewart's viewers ,COMMA the larger point remains that stewart's material is always grounded in a commitment to the facts -- not because his intent is to inform it's not 
His intent is to be funny 
And just like that ,COMMA you've been seduced into a different way of looking at something ,COMMA because the endorphins have brought down your defenses 
Because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military ,COMMA get married and start a family 
Economy of language is another real strong suit of great comedy 
How about that ,COMMA how about we create a better world for nothing 
And not long after that ,COMMA he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change ,COMMA in sacramento last year .PERIOD 
And i think that if you're not ,COMMA there's probably something inherently wrong with the structure ,COMMA or the situation you're in if you're a designer ,COMMA 
Being serious is hard 
Serious design serious play is something else .PERIOD 
Now i always saw design careers like surreal .PERIOD staircases 
And as you get older and more decrepit ,COMMA you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase ,COMMA leading you into oblivion .PERIOD 
There's a paul newman movie that i love called the verdict ,COMMA 
This is the case .PERIOD there are no other cases 
And that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play 
There was no format 
I lived and breathed it ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA i haven't with a client since 
It enabled me to really express myself and grow 
But something happened to it ,COMMA and what happened to it was ,COMMA it became very popular 
Here's an ad in the new york times ,COMMA somebody did for a play called mind games .PERIOD 
I'd never done this kind of work before 
This is symphony space on 90th street and broadway .PERIOD and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics .PERIOD 
And it was serious play 
They got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously ,COMMA 
But it became the end of the seriousness of the play .PERIOD and it started to once ,COMMA again ,COMMA become solemn .PERIOD 
And then i spent a year going to long ,COMMA tedious ,COMMA boring meetings ,COMMA trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears .PERIOD 
Here's the united states 
And there are some brilliant linguists ,COMMA mostly russians ,COMMA who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow ,COMMA and i would love to see where that leads 
You may just know more about everything than anyone 
It was a big idea for sure ,COMMA and it was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision ,COMMA making of this body through animations of global data trends and other information regarding the globe .PERIOD on this sphere ,COMMA 
We can use leds 
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display ,COMMA my father ,COMMA and i are working on a new patent-pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon .PERIOD 
And so you could see that ,COMMA as this disc rotates about this axis ,COMMA it will create a disc of light that we can control 
That's nothing new .PERIOD that's a propeller clock .PERIOD that's the rims that you can buy for your car .PERIOD 
Now as we continue to tinker with the oceans ,COMMA more ,COMMA and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals ,COMMA like jellyfish and bacteria 
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there ,COMMA a by-the-wind sailor 
It reaches up to almost 5000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish ,COMMA primarily 
They like to sunbathe ,COMMA can't blame them 
You know ,COMMA you look at sharks ,COMMA and they're streamlined ,COMMA and they're sleek ,COMMA and you look at tuna ,COMMA and they're like torpedoes -- they just give away their agenda .PERIOD they're about migration and strength .PERIOD and then you look at the sunfish 
And this is just so elegantly mysterious .PERIOD it's just -- it really kind of holds its cards a lot .PERIOD tighter than say ,COMMA a tuna 
And from that little egg ,COMMA they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage ,COMMA reminiscent of their ancestry .PERIOD and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage 
That's a little diver up there in the corner ,COMMA 
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world 
And it's pictured right here that little tag up there 
But they have 40 genera of parasites .PERIOD and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what are we trying to find out ?QUESTIONMARK we're focusing on the pacific 
We're tagging on the california coast ,COMMA and we're tagging over in taiwan and japan 
Not this time of year -- it's more around ,COMMA october 
And i'm not exaggerating .PERIOD it is just -- and sometimes they don't eat them .PERIOD it's just spiteful 
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head ,COMMA and the fish come up ,COMMA and they just clean clean clean -- because the molas you know ,COMMA there's just a smorgasbord of parasites 
I'm going to show you our latest dataset 
And we found that they kind of are homebodies 
So that's a very important piece of data 
But also what's important is that they're not slacker ,COMMA lazy fish 
I set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish 
I was getting reports from catholic nuns ,COMMA jewish rabbis ,COMMA muslims christians -- everybody writing in united by their love of life .PERIOD 
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest 
Under a tree .PERIOD she saw a woman meditating furiously

I want to tell you about something i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in guys .PERIOD ok ,COMMA

We are anonymous .PERIOD we are legion .PERIOD 
We are ,COMMA but the base of chaos 
And they're pretty scary .PERIOD 
You never know when they're going to attack next who ,COMMA or what the consequences will be 
There's a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them 
But one thing is true .PERIOD we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle ,COMMA for control of the internet ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA this is a very complicated struggle .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions ,COMMA which cost a huge amount of money 
But because they're a un operation ,COMMA maybe that's why governments and corporations are not that interested in them 
Because it's a un operation .PERIOD of course .PERIOD it lacks funding .PERIOD 
Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details to exchange information about new malware that was out there 
The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally ,COMMA and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i spoke to one of these carders who we'll call redbrigade -- although that wasn't even his proper nickname -- but i promised i wouldn't reveal who he was 
And this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in california .PERIOD 
And he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed also for the authorities here that gary mckinnon -- who is wanted by the united states for hacking into the pentagon -- suffers from asperger's and a secondary condition of depression 
How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole 
I think ,COMMA to an extent you have to understand that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that 
Has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller ,COMMA mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more and living in detached buildings .PERIOD you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of 
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips ,COMMA there are reasons why it's important to retrofit 
But is it practical 
June williamson ,COMMA and i have been researching this topic for over a decade ,COMMA and we've found over 80 varied projects 
That basically the boomers want to be able to age in place and gen y would like to live an urban lifestyle ,COMMA but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia 
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes ,COMMA as universities ,COMMA and as all variety of office space 
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools ,COMMA lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one 
This one is a little l-shaped strip shopping center .PERIOD in phoenix ,COMMA arizona ,COMMA 
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint ,COMMA a gourmet grocery ,COMMA and they put up a restaurant in the old post office

When metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site ,COMMA the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface ,COMMA lots a new main street ,COMMA several apartments and condo buildings ,COMMA while keeping the existing office buildings 
So here's what it looks like 
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new main street 
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction 
But it's also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability 
So this is one that has been ,COMMA retrofitted in california 
So there's a lot of great things ,COMMA but i'd love to see more corridors .PERIOD getting retrofitting .PERIOD 
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .PERIOD 
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the internet 
Now retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism ,COMMA and not without reason ,COMMA you don't get much more phony than an astroturf town green 
I have to say ,COMMA these are very hybrid places 
Or maybe it's because when i was a teenager ,COMMA back in the '50s ,COMMA my uncle henry -- having denounced ,COMMA the ku klux klan and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard ,COMMA living under death threat -- took his wife and children to massachusetts for safety and went back to south carolina to face ,COMMA down the klan alone .PERIOD

And there ,COMMA mr .PERIOD teszler began all over again .PERIOD and once again ,COMMA achieved immense success ,COMMA especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .PERIOD 
He got the same answer .PERIOD you bring the best workers that you can find .PERIOD and if they are good enough ,COMMA i will hire them 
Do you have any other questions 
And into the slow ,COMMA second movement ,COMMA marked adagio religioso ,COMMA he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring .PERIOD he was imagining a future for her in which he would play .PERIOD no part 
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow hungarians -- robicsek teszler ,COMMA and bartok -- as it does my own

Women go days weeks months without looking at it

Vagina vagina vagina ,COMMA it doesn't matter how many times you say the word it never sounds like a word .PERIOD you want to say ,COMMA 
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition

One woman took that energy ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA i want to bring this wave ,COMMA this energy to college campuses ,COMMA and so she took the play .PERIOD and she said ,COMMA let's use the play and have performances of the play once a year where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities ,COMMA all around the world .PERIOD 
And this is a very heady place .PERIOD 
It's a body world ,COMMA and the species really exists in the body .PERIOD and i think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads -- that that separation has created a divide that is often separating purpose from intent ,COMMA 
When we met her three years ago ,COMMA we said ,COMMA what could v-day do for you 
Now mr .PERIOD alligator never did come .PERIOD but the idea of mr .PERIOD alligator coming actually saved my sanity ,COMMA and made it ok ,COMMA for me to keep going .PERIOD because i believed in the distance ,COMMA there would be someone coming to rescue me 
They're like the mercedes-benz of the rift valley ,COMMA 
And he'd show up obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand ,COMMA which is that when we give in the world ,COMMA what we want the most ,COMMA we heal the broken part inside each of us 
We can reconcile 
We can do everything 
My mother died in [a] gynecology complication ,COMMA so i decided to become a gynecology specialist 
Maybe i should become an historian ,COMMA or maybe a reporter 
She graduated in russia .PERIOD also 
I succeeded in my place 
That's the best part 
Our country has two exploration programs 
We learned of marshall kay's geosynclinal cycle ,COMMA which is a bunch of crap 
Mostly discoveries made by accident .PERIOD 
I believe in just enriching the economy 
Alvin and sea cliff and cyana and all the major deep submersibles ,COMMA we have ,COMMA which are about eight 
The mid-ocean ridge runs around like the seam on a baseball 
This is on a mercator projection 
But if you were to put it on an equal area projection ,COMMA you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the earth's total surface area 
This is what a real one looks like on the juan de fuca ridge .PERIOD 
But more importantly ,COMMA they discovered edifices down there that they did not understand 
We found the bismarck in 16000 feet ,COMMA we then found the yorktown 
And we stole recently a ship from the united states navy ,COMMA 
It comes online this summer ,COMMA and it begins its journey of exploration .PERIOD 
We have no idea what we're going to discover 
And when you get a jaw drop ,COMMA you can inform 
This i hope will be a future engineer or a future scientist in the battle for truth .PERIOD 
You must get them custom made -- special ,COMMA humongous guitars 
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .PERIOD 
But i want to though explain how i came to design my own particular brand of comedy ,COMMA because i've been through so many different forms of it 
I started with improvisation in a particular form of improvisation called theater games ,COMMA which had one rule ,COMMA which i always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society .PERIOD 
But only two percent ,COMMA don't know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf's monetary policy -- seems a contradiction 
So this subject-object thing is part of something i'm very interested in because this is ,COMMA why frankly i believe ,COMMA in political correctness .PERIOD 
Maybe too far ,COMMA but you know -- i don't think that a person of color making fun of white .PERIOD people is the same thing as a white person ,COMMA making fun of people of color 
There always had to be the butt of a joke .PERIOD 
And then coming to this conference ,COMMA i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities ,COMMA because really what trickster is is an agent of change 
I hope that's my agent because you aren't paying me anything 
And he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mime properly .PERIOD 
Huh ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK what can't hear you 
But here's how i think i like to make change ,COMMA and that is in making connections 
And didn't that feel good 
And now we're being penetrated 
I still have a way to go 
And what i hope to do when i make these connections is short circuit people's thinking .PERIOD 
I like to think of what i do as a probability wave 
And thank you for inviting me into it 
Can we run that andrew 
I would propose ,COMMA therefore that if we took 10 billion dollars from that 213 trillion dollar budget -- which is two one hundredths of that budget -- and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems .PERIOD i'm going to talk to you about the vast majority could be solved ,COMMA and the rest we could deal with .PERIOD so i hope you find this both fascinating -- i'm fascinated by this kind of stuff ,COMMA i gotta admit -- to me ,COMMA these are richard's ,COMMA cockroaches

Many other ecosystems on earth are in real ,COMMA real danger .PERIOD 
They expect them to evaporate 
This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the united states ,COMMA and it got into the human food supply ,COMMA and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily .PERIOD 
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently ,COMMA that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world from biotechnology ,COMMA that literally could destroy the world's food supply .PERIOD in very short order 
Believe it or not this happens every few hundred thousand years and has happened many times in our history .PERIOD 
But what happens as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth ,COMMA over the period of about 100 years .PERIOD and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are -- well ,COMMA basically ,COMMA we're gonna fry 
So maybe we're in the throes of it 
There's a flip side to it in studying stars ,COMMA like our sun .PERIOD we've found that they go through periods of diminishment ,COMMA when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them goes down by maybe one percent 
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head ,COMMA like anthrax ,COMMA 
Again ,COMMA we gotta think about being ,COMMA a colonizing race ,COMMA 
That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future 
And he scans across the ocean ,COMMA and he looks at the sky 
Now i don't expect all of you to see all the details here .PERIOD but what i want you to see is this is about 10 percent of the processes that operate within the oceans almost continuously and have for the last 4 billion years .PERIOD 
This is very ,COMMA very important ,COMMA because this is the system .PERIOD this is the crucible ,COMMA out of which life on the planet came .PERIOD and it's now time for us to understand it 
All right ,COMMA let's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans 
Seconds after this video was taken people in beijing ,COMMA people in sydney people in amsterdam people in washington dc were watching this

This is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location then move to a new location 
Robotics systems are just incredible these days absolutely incredible .PERIOD 
What are the troops ?QUESTIONMARK the troops are the autonomous vehicles ,COMMA of course 
They eject it to the surface where it floats ,COMMA and it is picked up by an autonomous airplane ,COMMA and it's brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the eruption ,COMMA 
A laboratory many of you heard what happened on 9/7 
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning ,COMMA and it would be on live tv .PERIOD if we have interesting things to show

He won the nobel prize for literature in 1948 
But it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities .PERIOD 
These are the dimensions that i like to work with 
It's something very personal 
It's not perhaps the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners ,COMMA 
And today ,COMMA we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us 
I have never been a fan of the neutral 
Expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know 
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile ,COMMA but to reach out across the abyss of history to places we have never been ,COMMA and would have perhaps been had we not been so lucky 
Radical what does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK it's something which is rooted and something which is rooted deep in a tradition ,COMMA 
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending 
Therefore i believe it should not be cool .PERIOD 
Listening to all of you ,COMMA the complexity of thought ,COMMA the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming 
The political is not an enemy of architecture 
So the unexpected is always unexpected 
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability ,COMMA but an architecture that is full of tension ,COMMA an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart ,COMMA and that breaks out of the shackles of habits ,COMMA 
What is raw ?QUESTIONMARK the raw ,COMMA i would say is the naked experience ,COMMA untouched by luxury ,COMMA untouched by expensive materials ,COMMA untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture .PERIOD 
So that is ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA what is memory 
And it's not only our memory .PERIOD but those who remember us ,COMMA which means that architecture is not mute .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it costs a lot of money and so on ,COMMA but yes ,COMMA it should not play .PERIOD it safe 
It's about carving out a space for trees ,COMMA 
And yet ,COMMA in all its messiness ,COMMA in all its difficulties ,COMMA i would not have liked somebody to say ,COMMA this is the tabula rasa .PERIOD mister architect -- do whatever you want

You might wonder ,COMMA why are you wearing these western clothes ,COMMA 
Boy ,COMMA if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it .PERIOD 
But then he said ,COMMA boy ,COMMA if you run into a lion ,COMMA don't move 
We lived under apartheid regime 
And then in the same year ,COMMA we almost lost everything 
With independence ,COMMA the whole approach of community ,COMMA getting involved was embraced by our new government .PERIOD 
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation .PERIOD the very first one is honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas .PERIOD 
And at this sacred fire ,COMMA the spirit of our ancestors speak through the headman and advise us where to get water ,COMMA where to get grazings ,COMMA and where to go and hunt 
Transporting rhinos ,COMMA using helicopters i think is much easier than talking through a spirit that you can't see .PERIOD isn't it 
The other partners that we have got is business communities 
And so far with the support of world wildlife fund ,COMMA we've been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .PERIOD 
Namibia or sesfontein ,COMMA was no more an isolated village somewhere hidden away in namibia

If everybody in the developed world understood this graph ,COMMA and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads ,COMMA there would be no further societal argument about climate change .PERIOD because this is the story that counts 
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months 
That's the retreat of this glacier 
Geologic process in action here 
Greenland took a little while to start reacting to the warming climate of the past century ,COMMA but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago ,COMMA 
Helicopter in front of the calving face ,COMMA for scale ,COMMA quickly dwarfed 
It's flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left 
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA june ,COMMA 25th ,COMMA monster calving events happened 
Huge icebergs rolling over 
So an illustration ,COMMA again ,COMMA gives you a feeling for scale 
This is a terrific .PERIOD terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves .PERIOD and for the future ,COMMA 
Understanding all of this enables us to shift our perception of seafood away from a commodity to an opportunity to restore our ecosystem 
Great for fishermen ,COMMA lots of money ,COMMA supporting local economies ,COMMA 
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood is that it really takes into account our needs 
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart .PERIOD 
Forget nuclear holocaust ,COMMA it's the fork that we have to worry about 
People started buying appetizers and salads ,COMMA because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone .PERIOD

A time for plotting to whack the chief of police ,COMMA like in this classic scene from the godfather 
It works a little something like -- this is a recent google search for four in the morning .PERIOD 
Coincidence to me ,COMMA has a much simpler metric .PERIOD 
Herbert powell sure that's what he's paid for 
And folks you can buy a copy of bill clinton's my life from the bookstore here at ted 
By his own writing .PERIOD this man was either asleep ,COMMA at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch a nuclear missile out of a suitcase 
And once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions ,COMMA again ,COMMA either personally ,COMMA or with our loved ones and family members .PERIOD we also very quickly ,COMMA learn the benefits ,COMMA the trade-offs .PERIOD and the limitations of these tools 
We can all picture astronauts in space 
And in that space station we have the genetic material ,COMMA the chromosomes within a nucleus

What we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups -- so the chemotherapy treated group ,COMMA and the tumor treating field group -- was the same

It's now five years since robert's diagnosis ,COMMA and he's alive ,COMMA but importantly ,COMMA he's healthy ,COMMA and he's at work 
I'm going to let him in this very short clip ,COMMA describe his impressions of the therapy in his own words ,COMMA 
I'm going to show you another clip of a woman named lydia 
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy ,COMMA over two years ,COMMA none of which had an effect 
Her cancer continued to grow 
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids 
It's only the beginning

And the water will go where it should go 
And people made their house ,COMMA and the water storage tanks 
This is near jaipur this is called the jaigarh .PERIOD fort 
It can break sometimes 
It can envy many municipalities ,COMMA the color ,COMMA the taste ,COMMA the purity of this water 
And people started renovating their own structures .PERIOD 
Such a limited rainfall ,COMMA and highest colorful life flourished in these areas .PERIOD 
But it is invisible 
And then they will come and worship this pond :COLON pay respect their gratitude .PERIOD 
And perhaps they knew the future also 
How they maintain them

It was never popular with many political leaders ,COMMA especially those in the united states ,COMMA who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn't 
And they are building what i call the spinternet 
And police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek ,COMMA which is elude the cat in chinese slang ,COMMA with other inmates and hit his head against the wall ,COMMA which was not an explanation ,COMMA which sat well ,COMMA with many chinese bloggers 
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments 
And this actually fits with another interesting theory about what's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace 
And first it's quite simple .PERIOD 
So from this perspective ,COMMA having blogs and wikis produce knowledge has been great 
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums ,COMMA having them participate in decision making it's actually great 
And it's great simply because they can gather open source intelligence 
I mean kgb and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data 
Now it's all available online 
So ,COMMA what should we do about it 
Why are you crying 
No ,COMMA the boy said to me -- the boy said to me ,COMMA it would destroy me 
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good 
His father wasn't on the set 
We all looked up to him 
She's what i know today to be mentally ill ,COMMA higher-functioning at times than others ,COMMA 
So when i go in the room ,COMMA i close the door ,COMMA 
Now i say this all with remorse ,COMMA and i was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time ,COMMA but i was conflicted ,COMMA because ,COMMA while i was feeling remorse ,COMMA i was excited ,COMMA because i didn't get caught 
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating that it's okay to have feelings and emotions that it's okay to promote equality ,COMMA that it's okay to have women who are just friends .PERIOD and that's it that it's okay to be whole .PERIOD that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman 
Indeed ,COMMA what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic 
It's redolent of james bond movies and kipling ,COMMA ballads ,COMMA 
And in the information era ,COMMA we all live in today ,COMMA what we might call the ted age ,COMMA i'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of internet news ,COMMA of televised images ,COMMA of cellphone videos ,COMMA of email ,COMMA gossip 
We've been selling ,COMMA 15 million cellphones a month 
They had to suspend functions at 830 
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine .PERIOD tulsi zindabad ,COMMA long live tulsi .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA legend has is that when doubting thomas the apostle .PERIOD saint thomas landed on the shores of kerala ,COMMA my home ,COMMA state ,COMMA somewhere around 52 ad ,COMMA he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing jewish girl ,COMMA

All the others have been all those three 
In fact ,COMMA you can't even take the name of the country for granted .PERIOD because the name india comes from the river ,COMMA indus which flows in pakistan 
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land ,COMMA emerging from an ancient civilization ,COMMA united by a shared history ,COMMA but sustained above all ,COMMA by pluralist democracy ,COMMA 
Now that is the india that is emerging into the 21st century 
And i mean the world apparently is running out too 
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones ,COMMA bacteria that we don't like 
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like like ,COMMA staphylococcus -- i don't like it in particular ,COMMA because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .PERIOD 
So this was pretty shocking to me that we could do this 
And there's the very important thing there ,COMMA if you want to survive the cold ,COMMA you ought to be suspended ,COMMA right 
The highest concentration is in our brains 
And so we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold ,COMMA and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal ,COMMA 
So we wondered ,COMMA can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility ,COMMA 
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal 
And this company ,COMMA the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine .PERIOD and the results are incredibly positive 
And i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low 
You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them .PERIOD it's really confusing 
I’m going around the world giving talks about darwin .PERIOD and usually what i’m talking about is darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning .PERIOD 
Exactly exactly ,COMMA and it is a strange inversion 
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind ,COMMA you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet 
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t .PERIOD because if there were then mother nature would have a problem .PERIOD how on earth ?QUESTIONMARK do you get chimps to mate 
What we see with say ,COMMA chocolate cake is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring 
You’ve got 30 seconds ,COMMA you’d better be fast .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA lot’s of laughter .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD exactly 
So we might have a wild idea ,COMMA but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else 
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it 
Now ,COMMA that wasn’t just self-indulgence 
It takes more than decor ,COMMA but i think we’ve all seen that creative companies do often have symbols in the workplace ,COMMA that remind people to be playful ,COMMA and that it’s a permissive environment 
But why is it important 
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way ,COMMA to be honest .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the more creative of them might get to a really interesting example 
So another one of bob mckim’s favorite exercises is called the 30 circles test 
Okay ,COMMA put down your pencils as they say 
15 20 ,COMMA anybody get all 30 
I just wanted you to fill in as many circles as possible 
We stop ourselves from doing things 
I think the eameses are wonderful examples of experimentation 
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers coming out of world war ii and the korean war ,COMMA i think ,COMMA and from this experiment ,COMMA they moved on to chairs 
When play is about building a tower out of blocks .PERIOD the kid begins to learn a lot about towers 
And as they repeatedly knock it down and start again ,COMMA learning is happening as a sort of by-product of play ,COMMA 
So they learned their way to that by building prototypes 
And all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tangible object 
The prototyping carts ,COMMA filled with colored paper ,COMMA and play-doh and glue sticks and stuff -- i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them 
But by giving project teams and the clients who they’re working with permission to think with their hands ,COMMA quite complex ideas can spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily 
We’re doing the same thing as designers 
So remember ,COMMA the sketching task we did at the beginning 
As designers ,COMMA we need to be able to transition in ,COMMA and out of play ,COMMA also 
And it doesn't take long to go downhill 
And i got distracted by it 
And suddenly i was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent ,COMMA when i should have been talking to my clients 
My partner and i thom ,COMMA we had to let all our employees go 
Because with no employees ,COMMA there was nobody for me to manage 
And i grew up in this little farming town in northern nevada ,COMMA 
Britlin was so innocent ,COMMA and so sweet and her voice was so pure 
And i had this idea if i could get 50 people to all do this same thing ,COMMA sing their parts -- soprano ,COMMA alto ,COMMA tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world post their videos to youtube ,COMMA we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir 
And i sent out this call to singers 
And i made free the download of the music to a piece that i had written in the year .PERIOD 2000 ,COMMA called lux aurumque ,COMMA which means light and gold .PERIOD 
This is evangelina ,COMMA etienne from massachusetts .PERIOD 
I was told later ,COMMA and also ,COMMA by lots of singers who were involved in this that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it 
He scrubbed the audio 
And then we posted this video to youtube about a year and a half ago ,COMMA 
We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it 
And there were 900 people involved in that 
And we also put a page on facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials ,COMMA what it was like for them their experience ,COMMA singing it 
My sister and i used to sing in choirs together constantly 
Me too 
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir ,COMMA as i've never been part of one 
And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection 
It wasn't a virtual choir 
But i know myself too .PERIOD i feel this virtual esprit de corps ,COMMA if you will with all of them ,COMMA 
This is a recording i made of a mantis shrimp .PERIOD that's found off the coast of california 
And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises ,COMMA which also have a fast feeding appendage ,COMMA and i started to think .PERIOD well ,COMMA maybe it will be interesting while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes ,COMMA 
So we got this incredible video system .PERIOD it's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light ,COMMA 
And as you'll notice ,COMMA it's still pretty gosh darn fast slowed down 333 times .PERIOD it's an incredibly powerful movement .PERIOD 
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second ,COMMA all the way up to 23 meters per second 
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract ,COMMA and a very short time for the limb to fly out 
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe .PERIOD and the speed that we observe and the output of the system 
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface ,COMMA or an anticlastic surface ,COMMA 
In biological systems ,COMMA it's important ,COMMA not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it 
And so this is just a regular video of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA i think this will be a world record .PERIOD 
And what i'd like you to do in this shot ,COMMA is keep your eye on this on the surface of the load cell .PERIOD as the limb comes flying through 
People have been struggling for years to try and design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it .PERIOD just like these pictures show 
In fact ,COMMA you might have even seen .PERIOD some cavitation going up the edge of the limb 
Very ,COMMA very convenient solution to that particular problem 
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot .PERIOD in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods ,COMMA 
And this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really in all species their spring .PERIOD 
And so i'm very curious about whether those colored dots in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force ,COMMA and something about the time period in the molting cycle 
We still have one foot in the dark ages 
Ts .PERIOD eliot ,COMMA really said it for me -- and this should give you goose bumps :COLON we shall not cease from exploration .PERIOD and the end of our exploring shall be to return where we started and know the place for the first time 
It’s a thin film ,COMMA two-dimensional existence .PERIOD 
And if you hefted those two things you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1 
It actually is a very good working sub -- that’s what it was designed for 
A seat works in a two-dimensional world ,COMMA where gravity blasts down on that seat .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere ,COMMA 
This is a three-dimensional machine 
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater ,COMMA 
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before .PERIOD 
I’m trying to do everything very gently ,COMMA 
This is the first flying machine .PERIOD this was the first prototype 
There’re ,COMMA no silly buoyancy tanks -- it’s permanently ,COMMA positively buoyant .PERIOD 
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head 
And so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .PERIOD 
So the era of big infrastructure is over 
So ,COMMA albeit a very small creature and very modest ,COMMA this creature is incredible ,COMMA because it can agglomerate into these mega-reef structures 
But you can see even just intuit from this map ,COMMA that the harbor has dredged and flattened ,COMMA and went from a rich ,COMMA three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the gowanus is particularly smelly -- i will admit it 
When we started this project ,COMMA one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there 
We also learned at this time that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate in the gowanus canal itself 
It accepts algae and detritus in one end ,COMMA and through this beautiful ,COMMA glamorous set of stomach organs out .PERIOD the other end comes cleaner ,COMMA water 
Basically new york was built on the backs of oystermen ,COMMA and our streets were literally built over oyster shells 
What is fuzzy rope .PERIOD you ask 
So we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project 
So get your tevas on 
And then those spat are then seeded 
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .PERIOD 
So sorry -- it just feels like i should be doing stand-up up here ,COMMA because of the setting 
Because if we get it out of the streets ,COMMA it'll smell much better ,COMMA and -- oh ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK we drink from the river 
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies ,COMMA but nothing had really stuck 
You can't really see it in this map .PERIOD but this is the map that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book 
So it was this incredibly terrifying event 
Just an extraordinary terrifying scene 
And eventually snow made a map of the outbreak 
And he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods ,COMMA people who hadn't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA percentages of people who hadn't .PERIOD but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could see 
And so with the help of this map ,COMMA and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years ,COMMA and that whitehead did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the authorities slowly started to come around 
We don't worry that new york city is going to collapse in on itself .PERIOD quite the way that you know ,COMMA rome did and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years ,COMMA or 200 years ,COMMA 
His whole monastery was thrown into prison at the time of the uprising ,COMMA when the dalai lama had to leave tibet 
And it just so happened on the fifth week .PERIOD there was a public teaching by the dalai lama .PERIOD 
I interview and do portraits 
So this is our icon to non-violence in our world -- one of our living icons 
This is mengatoue 
He's the shaman of the huaorani ,COMMA and he said to us ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm an older man .PERIOD now ,COMMA i'm getting tired ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm tired of spearing .PERIOD these oil workers ,COMMA 
And this kid lived in the village -- he wasn't there at the time -- and this is the little movie ,COMMA he put together about that 
It's a question of what's the continuity 
We draw this set of nested spheres ,COMMA cut away .PERIOD so you see it 
So ,COMMA if you take a picture of what's going on ,COMMA it's 10 years ago ,COMMA 
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion ,COMMA and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent ,COMMA then to the dark ages ,COMMA and then the first stars turn on ,COMMA and they evolve into galaxies .PERIOD and then later ,COMMA they get to the more expansive galaxies ,COMMA 
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars ,COMMA just like the foam on the ocean 
And just put radially they're going out that way 
What happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates ,COMMA you get a fan across the sky 
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky 
So again ,COMMA you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here 
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out ,COMMA right 
So i'll show you the next movie 
We're going to keep zooming in ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
And so i forgot to tell you the scale 
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance 
There's a very simple fluid to begin with 
And so you know ,COMMA when you first saw this picture ,COMMA it didn't mean quite so much to you 
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe ,COMMA and you're seeing billions of galaxies ,COMMA right and nodes .PERIOD but you realize they're not even the main structure 
And we're going to fly around ,COMMA and we'll fly around ,COMMA and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect ,COMMA and you get a large cluster of galaxies 
So the question is ,COMMA how hard would it be to assemble this ?QUESTIONMARK right 
And so here we are 
This is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if you could see invisible matter too ,COMMA 
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe ,COMMA everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope ,COMMA plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom 
So i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture 
And at that point ,COMMA the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure 
The fact is that we're living longer 
It really involves many different areas 
And that's where the field is today .PERIOD 
We then grow the cells outside the body ,COMMA take the scaffold ,COMMA coat the scaffold with the cells -- the patient's own cells ,COMMA two different cell types .PERIOD 
So the strategy here is -- this is actually a ct scan an x-ray -- and we go layer by layer ,COMMA using computerized morphometric imaging analysis and 3d reconstruction to get right down to those patient's own kidneys 
And this is actually a new technology .PERIOD we're working on now ,COMMA 
I was able to do more things 
Most of my professors were all for it ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA bring pictures and show me the clips online ,COMMA and i'm happy for you 
'i failed' he cried 
One was -- never be late ,COMMA never be late .PERIOD 
That's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time ,COMMA 
He spelled moriarty with only one 'i' 
You and i know deeper down ,COMMA there's always a chance to win the crown .PERIOD 
Giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory 
Don't whine don't complain don't make excuses 
Not necessary to what you would want them to be ,COMMA but they will be about what they should .PERIOD and only you will know whether you can do that 
I mention in my book ,COMMA they call me coach 
So they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players .PERIOD i ever had 
So in other words ,COMMA what's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem .PERIOD a problem ,COMMA the economists call the coincidence of wants .PERIOD in approximately 60 seconds 
So what's happening here 
We're bartering ,COMMA trading ,COMMA swapping ,COMMA sharing ,COMMA but they're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms .PERIOD 
Over the next minute you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head ,COMMA 
I mean ,COMMA we're monkeys ,COMMA and we're born and bred to share and cooperate 
And we were doing so for thousands of years ,COMMA whether it's when we hunted in packs ,COMMA or farmed in cooperatives ,COMMA before this big system called hyper-consumption came along and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms ,COMMA 
They're growing up sharing -- files .PERIOD video games ,COMMA knowledge 
Thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists ,COMMA and he poignantly commented that 2008 is when we hit a wall when mother nature and the market ,COMMA both said ,COMMA no more 
The second is collaborative lifestyles 
Just think of libraries and laundrettes 
They are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow .PERIOD the new urban world 
Now ,COMMA why do i say that 
After we finished armstrong straightened his tie ,COMMA put on a wool sports jacket ,COMMA and we headed out into the glare 
I thought they might be playing king of the hill .PERIOD but i was wrong 
'it's a simple life ,COMMA but nobody is restricting you 
Beer is a very important thing in brazil 
This here on the right-hand side is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning -- it's a hotel 
And the second aspect is that once you have 2000 people in the community ,COMMA you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality .PERIOD 
My family moved .PERIOD we're nomads 
But these two people worked something out 
Right now those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year 
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .PERIOD 
And the avian flu is also not a good idea .PERIOD 
You should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for alzheimer’s disease 
And of course ,COMMA when it comes to cognitive effects ,COMMA use it or lose it applies ,COMMA so you want to stay mentally stimulated 
And one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology 
And obviously technology had existed before ,COMMA then ,COMMA but we weren't aware of it ,COMMA and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life ,COMMA 
And that's the very first use of the word 
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools 
So climate change is not a new thing .PERIOD 
And flowers and plants are the same thing extended ,COMMA and technology is basically an extension of life 
And the energy density that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip 
And there are things moving towards greater complexity ,COMMA moving towards greater diversity ,COMMA moving towards greater specialization ,COMMA sentience ,COMMA ubiquity and most important ,COMMA evolvability ,COMMA those very same things are also present in technology .PERIOD 
He could buy things that king henry in all his wealth could never buy 
And what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it 
So better ideas is really -- always the response to technology that we don't like is basically better technology 
And so every technology is sort of a creative force ,COMMA looking for the right job 
And we are aware of the price 
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us ,COMMA and it continues to go and our choice .PERIOD so to speak ,COMMA in technology is really to align ourselves with this force ,COMMA much greater than ourselves .PERIOD 
I really appreciate your attention today .PERIOD thank you 
Neil and i were sitting there comparing how little we've slept in anticipation for this .PERIOD i've never been so nervous -- and i do this when i'm nervous ,COMMA i just realized 
In the brooklyn neighborhood that i lived in park slope there are a lot of writers -- it's like a very high per capita ratio of writers to normal people 
So when i moved back to san francisco ,COMMA we rented this building 
So we thought we'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school ,COMMA get extra help on their written homework .PERIOD so you have basically no border between these two communities 
And we looked around ,COMMA and somebody else said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer 
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one 
While you're reading the sign ,COMMA we pull a rope behind the counter and eight mop heads drop on your head .PERIOD 
It became mop heads .PERIOD and this is the fish theater ,COMMA which is just a saltwater tank with three seats .PERIOD and then right behind it .PERIOD we set up this space ,COMMA which was the tutoring center .PERIOD 
And we thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA they're going to storm the gates ,COMMA they're gonna love it .PERIOD and they didn't 
You know ,COMMA it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention .PERIOD a student can get one grade level higher 
But there was something psychological happening there .PERIOD that was just a little bit different 
They're allowed to go home at 530 pm enjoy their family ,COMMA enjoy other hobbies .PERIOD get outside play .PERIOD 
Then we said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are we going to do with the space during the day ?QUESTIONMARK because it has to be used before 230 pm 
So this is one of the books that they do 
So ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA there's an adult in the back typing this up taking it completely seriously ,COMMA which blows their mind 
It's right off the library ,COMMA and there we serve all 529 kids in this middle school 
You can see amy tan sponsored .PERIOD the next one ,COMMA i might get somewhere 
We sell all the student books 
They would say what is this 
So the store actually did really well 
This is sam potts' great design that did this 
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there .PERIOD it goes up an electric lift ,COMMA and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism ,COMMA which you do ,COMMA if you want to buy anything ,COMMA and it limits ,COMMA really their sales ,COMMA 
So then the secret door -- this is one of the shelves you don't see when you walk in .PERIOD but it slowly opens 
This is one of the students ,COMMA khaled :COLON hamdan ,COMMA 
Came in got this concentrated attention 
I'm going to switch to we and not ,COMMA i hope we hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in a new era of participation in our public schools .PERIOD 
We hope that you will take the lead in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise with that of innovative educators in your community 
Hot studio did a great job in a very tight deadline .PERIOD so visit the site ,COMMA 
I've been a priest in the church for 20 years ,COMMA 
Do we really believe that god is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years .PERIOD 
Suggesting that god expresses himself or herself through powerlessness ,COMMA rather than power .PERIOD 
Acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition 
And this is what i said 
And we want an explanation from god 
For hundreds of years ,COMMA the prevailing orthodoxy ,COMMA the accepted truth was that god ,COMMA the father ,COMMA the creator is unchanging and therefore ,COMMA by definition ,COMMA cannot feel pain or sadness .PERIOD 
And the devastating events of the 20th century have forced people to question the cold ,COMMA unfeeling god ,COMMA 
Who is god in all this 
Do we have a local god ,COMMA who can do little things like parking spaces ,COMMA but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves .PERIOD 
That's just not acceptable to intelligent christians ,COMMA and we must acknowledge it 
You probably heard some of them ,COMMA the man who surfed the wave ,COMMA the teenage girl who recognized the danger ,COMMA because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school .PERIOD 
If we believe something like this ,COMMA we must let go of the puppet-master completely ,COMMA take our leave of the almighty controller ,COMMA abandon traditional models .PERIOD 
Maybe god isn't an agent like all of us are agents 
The people knew their god by his mighty acts ,COMMA 
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world 
In the end we have to say ,COMMA i don't know 
To have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements 
And how would one deepen such a faith 
But in the end ,COMMA the only thing i could say ,COMMA for sure was ,COMMA i don't know ,COMMA and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all 
It was deep at night 
And i kept on staring at it ,COMMA until it disappeared ,COMMA 
This is not a story of a nameless survivor of war ,COMMA and nameless refugees ,COMMA whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers and our tv with tattered clothes ,COMMA dirty face scared eyes .PERIOD 
War ,COMMA a friend of mine said is not about sound at all 
It is actually about silence .PERIOD the silence of humanity ,COMMA 
I have since left iraq and founded a group called women for women international that ends up working with women survivors of wars .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA but it's not fair because there is only one life .PERIOD and there should only be one death 
Ninety percent of modern war casualties are civilians .PERIOD 
How interesting 
There is a side that is led by men .PERIOD and there is a side that is led by women 
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability .PERIOD if we don't start investing in women and girls 
She got into women for women international's program 
To start with these women that i told you about are dancing and singing every single day ,COMMA and if they can ,COMMA who are we not to dance 
By accepting this dichotomy ,COMMA whether it's tongue-in-cheek ,COMMA when we attempt to accommodate it in our world ,COMMA and we try to build our foundation for the world .PERIOD we're messing up the future ,COMMA because who wants to be uncreative 
Now i grew up in the '60s ,COMMA and i'll admit it .PERIOD actually ,COMMA my childhood spanned the '60s ,COMMA and i was a wannabe hippie and i always resented the fact that i wasn't really old enough to be a hippie .PERIOD 
And i know there are people here ,COMMA the younger generation who want to be hippies ,COMMA but people talk about the '60s all the time ,COMMA and they talk about the anarchy that was there .PERIOD but when i think about the '60s ,COMMA what i took away from it was that there was hope for the future 
You see ,COMMA i always assumed i would go into space because i followed all of this ,COMMA but i also loved the arts and sciences 
Now ,COMMA my mother helped me figure that one out 
But when i went into space ,COMMA when i went into space ,COMMA i carried a number of things up with me ,COMMA i carried a poster by alvin ailey ,COMMA which you can figure out .PERIOD now ,COMMA i love the dance company ,COMMA 
And yeah ,COMMA sub-atomic physics is deconstructive .PERIOD you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what's inside of them but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors ,COMMA is deconstructive ,COMMA because you see a piece and you remove what doesn't need to be there 
It's the universe as experienced by everyone ,COMMA and the arts manifest our desire ,COMMA our attempt to share or influence others through experiences that are peculiar to us as individuals .PERIOD 
Do you know these books these such and such for dummies ,COMMA 
But i was looking online at amazoncom for other books ,COMMA like this 
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense ,COMMA 
I was in milan last week for the italian launch 
So it was traumatizing actually .PERIOD 
Modernism means white box .PERIOD and it's a perfect white box .PERIOD 
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters 
As a child ,COMMA we used to wake up at 1 ,COMMA am and work till 6 pm ,COMMA six days a week 
Thank you 
But the media lab is an interesting place ,COMMA and it's important to me ,COMMA because as a student ,COMMA i was a computer science undergrad .PERIOD and i discovered design later on in my life ,COMMA 
And there was this person .PERIOD muriel cooper .PERIOD 
It was the best advice i ever got .PERIOD so i went to art school because of her 
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us 
So ,COMMA if you sort of compare that like this ,COMMA you'll see that computer versus human -- i've been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed 
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff 
Lots of complex stuff 
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997 ,COMMA and this is a firework calendar .PERIOD so ,COMMA you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks ,COMMA you're cooler for some reason .PERIOD 
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things .PERIOD and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes 
And eye meat is something different ,COMMA something more fibrous ,COMMA something more powerful ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD but what could that be eye meat ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i went back to the computer ,COMMA and i bought five large fries ,COMMA and scanned them all .PERIOD and i was looking for some kind of food theme .PERIOD and i wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images 
And also as a child ,COMMA i was the fattest kid in class .PERIOD so i used to love cheetos .PERIOD oh ,COMMA i love cheetos yummy .PERIOD 
I discovered that cheetos are good .PERIOD expressive material 
It's a strange business model ,COMMA i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper ,COMMA and just stare at it with my latte .PERIOD 
In japan ,COMMA they say that sushi is challenging 
This book i wrote ,COMMA because i want to figure out life 
He's an expert in aging ,COMMA this horizontal axis is how old you are -- twelve years old ,COMMA twenty-four years old ,COMMA seventy-four ,COMMA ninety-six years old -- and this is some medical data .PERIOD so brain strength increases up to 60 .PERIOD and then ,COMMA after 60 ,COMMA it sort of goes down kind of depressing in a way .PERIOD 
Your social responsibility is very interesting 
How dare we be optimistic 
But as important as it is to change the lightbulbs ,COMMA it is more important to change the laws 
And there are lots of those .PERIOD but the climate crisis is the rare but all-important ,COMMA global ,COMMA or strategic ,COMMA conflict ,COMMA 
Greenland remains twenty-eight years ago .PERIOD this is what the polar ice cap -- the north polar ice cap -- looked like ,COMMA at the end of the summer ,COMMA at the fall ,COMMA equinox ,COMMA 
This last fall ,COMMA i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder ,COMMA colorado and talked to the researchers here in monterey ,COMMA at the naval postgraduate laboratory 
The north polar ice ,COMMA cap is the same size geographically -- doesn't look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states ,COMMA minus an area ,COMMA roughly equal to the state of arizona .PERIOD 
They have exactly the same amount of carbon 
What is missing is a sense of urgency .PERIOD 
Nbc -- i'll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for nbc asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates ,COMMA two of them were about the climate crisis .PERIOD abc 844 ,COMMA questions ,COMMA two about the climate crisis .PERIOD 
This is gasoline consumption ,COMMA in all of these countries and us 
We have the technologies 
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this ,COMMA the struggle against poverty in the world ,COMMA and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions all has a single very simple solution .PERIOD 
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries .PERIOD this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .PERIOD 
Lot of other things contributed to it ,COMMA but the new prime minister announced that his very first priority would be to change .PERIOD australia's position on kyoto .PERIOD and he has now they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had 
But we have a planetary emergency 
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the iraq war ,COMMA we could be well on the way to solving this challenge 
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .PERIOD 
Demand -- change the light bulbs .PERIOD but change the laws change .PERIOD the global treaties 
Now ,COMMA nobody is talking on that scale ,COMMA but i do believe that between now and november ,COMMA it is possible 
In terms of your own personal role ,COMMA going forward .PERIOD al is there something more than that ?QUESTIONMARK you would like to be doing 
Al gore .PERIOD thank you so much for coming to ted 
And that's certainly how it seemed to me .PERIOD when i started this project 
All this noise around us actually has information 
So what i started thinking was ,COMMA perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here 
So we started doing this ,COMMA and you can see here on the horizontal axis ,COMMA you've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack 
You take all of the conflict ,COMMA all of the chaos ,COMMA all of the noise .PERIOD and out of that comes this precise mathematical distribution of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict ,COMMA 
And we found that not only were the distributions these straight lines ,COMMA but the slope of these lines ,COMMA they clustered around this value of alpha equals 25 .PERIOD 
And we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack 
This is data statistics .PERIOD what does it tell us about these conflicts 
Turns out ,COMMA we kind of do a reasonable job 
So what's going on 
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns 
What does it look like 
We can push it up the forces become more fragmented .PERIOD there is more of them ,COMMA but they are weaker 
The opposite happened 
The groups became stronger 
But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them 
You work over different time zones ,COMMA you talk to very different people ,COMMA you multitask ,COMMA we all know it .PERIOD and we do it kind of automatically 
And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers ,COMMA just like designers are seeking scientists 
And keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others 
And it was great .PERIOD because at the beginning was this apology fest -- you know ,COMMA scientists would tell designers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i don't know what style is .PERIOD i'm not really elegant 
Paul steinhardt ,COMMA a physicist from new york and aranda/lasch architects ,COMMA collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine 
I'm showing to you different sections of the show right now ,COMMA just to give you a taste of it 
In this case i'm showing more .PERIOD the designers' work ,COMMA because they're the ones that have really been stimulated 
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty 
When you don't have to kill cows ,COMMA and it can have any shape .PERIOD what should it be like 
One of the most important topics of the show -- you know ,COMMA as anything in our life today ,COMMA we can look at it from many ,COMMA many different viewpoints ,COMMA and at different levels 
One of the most interesting ,COMMA and most important concepts is the idea of scale .PERIOD we change scale very often ,COMMA we change resolution of screens ,COMMA and we're not really fazed by it .PERIOD we do it very comfortably 
You can be in the subway ,COMMA and you can be completely isolated and have your own room in your ipod 
Again ,COMMA this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today ,COMMA 
And so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown-glass object where the bees move from one chamber to the other ,COMMA if they detect that particular smell that signifies ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA pregnancy 
Design for debate is a very interesting new endeavor ,COMMA that designers have really shaped for themselves .PERIOD 
And usually they are accompanied by videos ,COMMA 
It's quite amazing ,COMMA how these things can make you smile can make you laugh can make .PERIOD you cry .PERIOD sometimes 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
The only trouble is the people next door .PERIOD i can't stand them 
And yet ,COMMA if i just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings ,COMMA i wouldn't be doing my job -- because i have to actually be there for them and make sure that rituals happen ,COMMA that practicalities are seen to 
Who cannot be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war ,COMMA or famine ,COMMA or earthquakes ,COMMA or tsunamis ,COMMA 
And of course you can't do that ,COMMA unless you understand yourself a bit more 
Therefore there should be justice throughout the world 
So like snoopy ,COMMA we can't just lie there and think ,COMMA great thoughts about our neighbors ,COMMA 
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds ,COMMA but not ,COMMA of course ,COMMA at the expense of our own sanity ,COMMA 
What does this compassion entail 
And as many people do he was dozing off during the sermon 
And he rushed home ,COMMA and after the sabbath ,COMMA he made 12 loaves of bread .PERIOD took them to the synagogue ,COMMA went into the synagogue ,COMMA opened the ark and said ,COMMA god ,COMMA i don't know why you want this bread .PERIOD but here you are 
And he called the two of them to his office 
You mean ,COMMA god didn't want my bread 
And the rabbi said ,COMMA you've misunderstood me 
You've misunderstood totally .PERIOD he said ,COMMA 
Please keep your seat 
Wrap it in an ace bandage ,COMMA take some ibuprofen for a week or two .PERIOD and that's the end of the story .PERIOD 
How can the nervous system get this so wrong 
In your house wires run in the wall ,COMMA from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb 
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls ,COMMA so that the next time you turned on the light switch ,COMMA the toilet flushed three doors down ,COMMA or your dishwasher went on ,COMMA or your computer monitor ,COMMA turned off 
If you look out your window ,COMMA and you can see long's peak .PERIOD you're probably familiar with it .PERIOD 
Take meeker .PERIOD mt .PERIOD meeker lump that in there and put that in space as well and mt .PERIOD everest and k2 .PERIOD and the indian peaks 
Because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular ,COMMA and people would bring them parents would bring them to their kids' football games to film their kids play football .PERIOD and since this came in on a friday ,COMMA they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virgina maryland ,COMMA pennsylvania ,COMMA and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york 
This did a huge amount of damage 
The one over tunguska was probably made of rock ,COMMA and that's much more crumbly ,COMMA so it blew up in the air ,COMMA either way .PERIOD these are tremendous explosions ,COMMA 20 megatons ,COMMA 
I don't think apophis is a problem 
In fact ,COMMA apophis is a blessing in disguise ,COMMA because it woke us up to the dangers of these things 
Well ,COMMA let me ask you what happens if you're standing in the middle of the road and a car's headed for you ?QUESTIONMARK what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK you do this 
I think even nasa can do that ,COMMA and they proved that they can 
After the big macho ,COMMA rrrrrrr ,COMMA bam .PERIOD we're gonna hit this thing in the face ?QUESTIONMARK then we bring in the velvet gloves 
There's a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation for those of you who've read the little prince .PERIOD you understand that reference .PERIOD i hope the little prince who lived on an asteroid it was called b612 
So think about this right 
Now ,COMMA those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent ,COMMA i think should enjoy it until it lasts 
My story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in 1991 
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ,COMMA because if we did not ,COMMA we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history .PERIOD 
So here we are having our first client .PERIOD brilliant 
It's a kind of very nice ,COMMA sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper 
And we said ,COMMA that's fine .PERIOD let's meet .PERIOD you'll bring us your business plan ,COMMA which eventually they did 
We start the meeting 
But ,COMMA however ,COMMA you put it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the numbers do not make any sense 
We were the best that they could do 
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world 
So what the governor got was an empty shell 
So from that perspective ,COMMA what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify 
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations ,COMMA doing very important ,COMMA work .PERIOD 
Now imagine that every second person over here is deaf ,COMMA does not hear and switch the lights off 
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform ,COMMA to totally rethink fundraising .PERIOD 
And then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue .PERIOD his electricity in bangladesh bonds .PERIOD 
So indeed ,COMMA i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive 
So since i tell stories ,COMMA let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i've studied to illustrate this point -- abraham ,COMMA lincoln and lyndon johnson 
But he read books in every spare moment he could find 
Three things had combined to lay him low 
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal 
And his great friend speed went to his side and said ,COMMA lincoln ,COMMA you must rally or you will die .PERIOD 
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry ,COMMA he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul .PERIOD 
Knowing that tolstoy was in their midst ,COMMA they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history .PERIOD 
But instead surprisingly ,COMMA he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA bring her down here for a year .PERIOD and if i can't win her over ,COMMA no one can 
But they were great .PERIOD nonetheless ,COMMA 
But i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman 
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings 
And the british people were still upset about losing the revolution .PERIOD so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general ,COMMA washington in the only outhouse ,COMMA where he'd have to encounter it 
Which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall ,COMMA to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work 
But it so happened .PERIOD he was speaking in a protestant church 
So i went to my father in tears .PERIOD what are we going to do 
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church ,COMMA wishing harm to others .PERIOD being mean ,COMMA to my sisters ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA here's an example from my own experience .PERIOD 
There are lots of people who believe that ,COMMA and i think it is utter baloney .PERIOD 
I think that's the main point to be made 
And i won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics ,COMMA and what it's like ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff .PERIOD 
And in a lot of familiar cases ,COMMA they of course ,COMMA are 
So it's not a theory of everything .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents ,COMMA and not just from the fundamental laws 
You know what it means a circle ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle .PERIOD 
Maxwell's equations ,COMMA are ,COMMA of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space .PERIOD 
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that ,COMMA 
So here we say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what we said before that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins 
And therefore it looks beautiful ,COMMA because we already know how to write it in a lovely ,COMMA concise way .PERIOD 
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity 
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity 
Now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind 
They are what we call emergent properties .PERIOD 
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more 
Life can emerge from physics and chemistry ,COMMA plus a lot of accidents ,COMMA 
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us 
We perish ,COMMA they survive .PERIOD we have one life .PERIOD they have many lives .PERIOD and in each life ,COMMA they can mean different things 
The central element still of the notion of return ,COMMA a central part of the life of judaism ,COMMA 
All of those are respected by cyrus ,COMMA 
It left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together 
For them ,COMMA of course it can't possibly by marduk that made all this happen .PERIOD 
And it's quite clear .PERIOD the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah .PERIOD and yet jehovah is speaking in words ,COMMA very similar to those used by marduk 
The state of israel is setup and 50 years later ,COMMA in the late 60s ,COMMA it's clear that britain's role as the imperial power is over 
It's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran ,COMMA one of the many women in iran in very senior positions .PERIOD mrs .PERIOD ardakani 
And it's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means ,COMMA but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- cyrus ,COMMA as the defender of the homeland ,COMMA the champion of course ,COMMA of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples ,COMMA tolerant of all faiths .PERIOD 
Will iran set free ,COMMA the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated 
A replica of this is at the united nations ,COMMA 
But i think it's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well ,COMMA be the voice of this mute thing .PERIOD the cyrus cylinder 
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do 
In fact ,COMMA i have got qualifications .PERIOD 
So i started thinking about peace ,COMMA and i was obviously ,COMMA as i said to you very much moved by these images ,COMMA trying to make sense of that 
Could i go and speak to older and wiser people ,COMMA who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on 
And that was when i had the idea 
There was no day of global unity 
And that's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .PERIOD 
Could you give me a flight ,COMMA because we're going to go see him 
And of course we went and saw him ,COMMA and it was amazing 
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing ,COMMA and really empowering actually 
And we were listening to everybody 
And working with ngos and building this case ,COMMA 
I felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .PERIOD 
And this young child who'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic ,COMMA and that young boy who was a child soldier who told me he'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop 
If this is the only film that i ever make ,COMMA i'm going to document until this becomes a reality 
The costa rican government ,COMMA and the british government had put forward to the united nations .PERIOD general assembly ,COMMA with 54 co-sponsors ,COMMA the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day .PERIOD the 21st of september ,COMMA as a fixed calendar date ,COMMA and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .PERIOD 
And as i mentioned ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA we were at the globe ,COMMA and there was no press 
It's been created .PERIOD nobody knows 
But we have to continue this journey ,COMMA and we have to tell people ,COMMA and we have to prove it can work 
And after lots and lots of meetings ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA i'm delighted that this man ahmad ,COMMA fawzi ,COMMA one of my heroes and mentors really .PERIOD he managed to get unicef involved 
And i saw him ,COMMA because he was an actor .PERIOD i was an actor .PERIOD i had a connection to him ,COMMA because we needed to get to the press .PERIOD we needed this attraction .PERIOD we needed the media to be involved 
Because if we start pumping it up a bit ,COMMA maybe more people would listen ,COMMA and there'd be more -- when we got into certain areas ,COMMA maybe there would be more people interested 
I won't go into that 
So jude said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i'll do some statements for you 
And i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest 
So these guys were absolutely crucial 
This amazing woman :COLON fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .PERIOD 
And her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .PERIOD 
We will observe this day 
We see it as a window of opportunity 
And so then we wrapped the film up ,COMMA and we put it together ,COMMA because we had to go back 
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say ,COMMA look ,COMMA you guys made this possible .PERIOD and thank you very much .PERIOD 
And i kept thinking about this 70 percent 
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible .PERIOD and you couldn't do 
He's an amazing man 
It's all about the individuals 
And it then made me think about a glass of water ,COMMA which is clear 
Thank you very much .PERIOD thank you 
There was not a flashlight ,COMMA not a lantern ,COMMA not a candle -- pitch black .PERIOD 
Anesthetic wears off ,COMMA the patient feels pain 
And her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire .PERIOD everyone start all over again .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what does this have to do with leadership 
They are the elite ,COMMA they are our leaders 
And we need to train them right 
And one day ,COMMA i go to the airport to meet my father ,COMMA and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building ,COMMA i'm stopped by two soldiers ,COMMA wielding ak-47 ,COMMA assault weapons 
So a few years after this event ,COMMA i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college ,COMMA for my education ,COMMA 
They wanted us to be analytical 
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues 
It was brilliant 
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do 
Now we cannot achieve perfection ,COMMA but if we reach for it ,COMMA then we can achieve excellence ,COMMA 
I don't know ,COMMA ultimately what they will do 
But the conversation they're having now -- about what their good society should look like what their excellent society .PERIOD should look like is a really good thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now i just wanted to leave that slide up ,COMMA because it's important that we think about it 
I am even more thrilled .PERIOD by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government .PERIOD 
It's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university 
It says a lot about her peers who elected her 
My job is to make arms and legs -- well it's not completely true .PERIOD 
And then not only for war victims ,COMMA but it was for any kind of patient 
I was also working in the orthopedic center .PERIOD we call it 
But it was a terrific job 
So the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA you know ,COMMA every time i make this speech -- it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion 
I wanted to go home .PERIOD i was driving 
And everybody disappeared from the street 
The man was without legs and only with one arm 
And i ask ,COMMA what are you doing out in the street in this situation ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then i said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ?QUESTIONMARK what did i say ?QUESTIONMARK 
He was coming every day crossing the front line .PERIOD 
Two groups of mujahideen started fighting 
So we dashed ,COMMA all of us towards the shelter 
Everybody was grabbing something 
And i will never forget mahmoud and his son ,COMMA walking together pushing the empty wheelchair .PERIOD 
I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students 
I said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA 
And then he sat down 
So the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise 
I understood that i was wrong again .PERIOD 
And then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different 
We decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job 
I said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD we can't 
And you should see me during the match 
I shout like a true italian 
In this image of the tokyo skyline .PERIOD i've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block .PERIOD the kepler mission 
There we go 
And we can measure this very ,COMMA very precisely with kepler and trace their effects 
Wrong ,COMMA i'm not looking at you .PERIOD i can't see you 
I have to do something now ,COMMA which seems a little bit strange for a magician ,COMMA 
Oh ,COMMA they gladly sell you that ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA 
But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead 
I don't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do ,COMMA exactly the same -- the same physical methods ,COMMA the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment .PERIOD 
Good bye ,COMMA 
The second question that i'd like to ask rather simple ?QUESTIONMARK suppose i ask them to contact .PERIOD the spirit of my deceased father-in-law ,COMMA as an example ,COMMA 
Is this a hunting game 
But it is a cruel ,COMMA vicious ,COMMA absolutely conscienceless -- i'll be all right .PERIOD keep your seats -- game that these people play 
Folks that's what dying is all about 
Now ,COMMA it may bring a certain amount of comfort ,COMMA but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so 
We all know who he is on television 
He's well educated ,COMMA he's smart .PERIOD he knows what sylvia browne is doing ,COMMA but he doesn't give a damn 
Because the bottom line is ,COMMA the sponsors love it ,COMMA and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .PERIOD 
Now without that ,COMMA how could we possibly function 
She gives you the names of previous lives ,COMMA who you were in previous lives ,COMMA 
Duh 
Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of london ,COMMA who died of consumption 
All the more reason to take the million dollars ,COMMA wouldn't you think sylvia 
Why don't they affect me 
Now folks ,COMMA this is not just a metaphor .PERIOD i'm going to give you now .PERIOD it's true 
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute ,COMMA the medicine is they say ,COMMA the more powerful .PERIOD it is 
Largely ,COMMA it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing 
It's the bottom line ,COMMA the dollar line 
Now we've offered this carrot as i say ,COMMA we've dangled the carrot 
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA i'm james randi .PERIOD and i'm waiting 
And one of the major gaps in care ,COMMA almost across the board is access to safe surgery .PERIOD 
In the background ,COMMA there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine .PERIOD 
In order to operate this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer 
And finally ,COMMA i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury ,COMMA and can often be out of stock for months ,COMMA or even a year 
One of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone about a year ago ,COMMA 
And the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case 
And everything began pretty auspiciously 
My colleague dr .PERIOD paul fenton was living .PERIOD this reality 
He went to work every day in an operating theater ,COMMA like this one ,COMMA trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable ,COMMA and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA unsafe ,COMMA in his hospital ,COMMA 
But this gives control to the provider ,COMMA whether there's power or not ,COMMA because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they're giving their patient 
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries .PERIOD and since 2010 ,COMMA we've done well over 2000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events 
So we're thrilled 
Because only once before has the fate of individual people ,COMMA and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined 
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA that's not such a big deal .PERIOD 
But back to animals and junk food ,COMMA 
Two both have been marketed heavily ,COMMA creating unnatural demand .PERIOD 
And they do this here .PERIOD it's the same deal .PERIOD 
That's just the united states 
There were no restaurant chains 
Fats carbs ,COMMA proteins -- they weren't bad or good .PERIOD they were food 
The south and west became agricultural hubs .PERIOD and in other parts of the country ,COMMA suburbs took over farmland ,COMMA 
If we had a slide of salisbury steak ,COMMA even more so right 
Thanks to farm subsidies ,COMMA the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king .PERIOD 
Not that they were any good ,COMMA but they were there 
For dessert ,COMMA store-bought ice cream or cookies 
So now you've got your pizza nights ,COMMA you've got your microwave nights ,COMMA you've got your grazing nights ,COMMA you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .PERIOD 
Meat junk food ,COMMA cheese .PERIOD the very stuff that will kill you 
So now we clamor for organic food 
I don't know 
Ann cooper's right 
The usda is not our ally here .PERIOD 
Cruelty ,COMMA i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we ,COMMA hypocritically ,COMMA wouldn't even consider for our own cats .PERIOD dogs and other pets .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why was i stalling 
Best of all ,COMMA i'm healthier ,COMMA i know that i'm going to live longer .PERIOD and i've even lost a little weight 
Thank you 
Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers ,COMMA which is encouraging 
The first is -- death is a big problem 
Sometimes we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar ,COMMA or it's too big .PERIOD 
People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died 
Suppose we approximated one person with one book 
So that's the first big problem .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA let's first look at the probability -- and this is very ,COMMA very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this .PERIOD in recent years ,COMMA which is surprising 
He estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century .PERIOD 50 percent 
Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate .PERIOD but says the probability is significant that it will fail .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction ,COMMA by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved ,COMMA if we just count the currently living people ,COMMA the current generation 
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk ,COMMA because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve 
And even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct .PERIOD it should still have a high priority .PERIOD 
We were very successful 
We might end up with something like this ,COMMA which is -- i mean ,COMMA it's a heck of a lot better than that .PERIOD 
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that .PERIOD well ,COMMA sure ,COMMA there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people 
Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box ,COMMA which falls into a lot of different sub-categories :COLON memory ,COMMA concentration ,COMMA mental energy ,COMMA intelligence ,COMMA empathy .PERIOD 
Able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state ,COMMA when you're totally immersed in something you are doing 
If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person ,COMMA undiminished through time ,COMMA so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to 
Might be more complicated in humans ,COMMA but perhaps not that much 
Well ,COMMA we know already that in this little human circle there there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful 
We have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space ,COMMA there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about 
And so to fix this third problem ,COMMA i think we need -- slowly ,COMMA carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there 
The sun end was about four inches in diameter ,COMMA and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter .PERIOD at the earth end 
So i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that 
So many forces there 
If i throw a very concentric circle ,COMMA or concentric ellipse ,COMMA it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines ,COMMA which get closer and closer together ,COMMA which describes how gravity works .PERIOD 
Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology ,COMMA it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with 
Oh ,COMMA let's hope so oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA let's 
And i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature .PERIOD humans are of the universe 
And we are expressions of the universe ,COMMA basically ,COMMA 
As humans ,COMMA ultimately ,COMMA being part of the universe .PERIOD we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe ,COMMA 
And to interface with it ,COMMA with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do ,COMMA giving them pigment and paint .PERIOD just like an artist .PERIOD it's a good ally 
It's become an art form ,COMMA a form of sculpture ,COMMA 
But even more importantly ,COMMA he created a language ,COMMA a way we could communicate .PERIOD a code of dots ,COMMA dashes and arrows 
This is an origami figure -- one sheet ,COMMA no cuts ,COMMA folding only ,COMMA hundreds of folds 
This too is origami .PERIOD and this shows where we've gone in the modern world 
You can get horns ,COMMA antlers -- even if you look close ,COMMA cloven hooves 
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art ,COMMA which is math 
I mean ,COMMA a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws .PERIOD it's got antennae .PERIOD can you be that specific in the detail 
If i make the flaps skinnier ,COMMA i can use a bit less paper 
And i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes 
Do a little more complicated instrument ,COMMA 
And he used it to design this solar array .PERIOD 
The telescope going up in space ,COMMA it unfolds in two places .PERIOD 
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25000 miles up .PERIOD 100-meter diameter lens 
And rockets are small ,COMMA so you have to make it smaller 
But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters 
And they want to do their design by simulation 
And as weird and surprising as it may sound ,COMMA origami may someday even save a life 
Now ecstasy in greek meant simply ,COMMA to stand to the side of something 
You can't understand more than two people talking to you 
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field 
Whether it's mathematics or music ,COMMA it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before .PERIOD 
You see that these people define success as something that helps others .PERIOD and at the same time ,COMMA makes you feel happy as you are working at it 
The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal ,COMMA 
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand 
Not a lot of women did 
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind 
This is really just about the facts of this economic moment that we live in 
This second set of headlines -- you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift 
And so they decided because they were intrigued by this finding to do a nationwide survey 
So they spread out all the census data ,COMMA and what they found the guy described to me as a shocker ,COMMA which is that in 1997 out of 2000 communities ,COMMA women ,COMMA young women were making more money than young men 
Watch what happens to the women .PERIOD watch what happens to the men 
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game ,COMMA or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills that lets them shoot up high 
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot 
So that's childcare ,COMMA elder care and food preparation 
And some people say it's because ,COMMA in 9th grade ,COMMA boys start dropping out of school 
Basically the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day that their husband would maybe have a job ,COMMA but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .PERIOD 
And this was kind of a shocker to me 
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women in the civil code 
For one thing ,COMMA it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling .PERIOD 
So the image that i like to think of instead of glass ceiling ,COMMA is the high bridge 
There's no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the cables 
To the dismay of my mother .PERIOD this is dangerous teenage fashion right there 
Really make a fully integrated product ,COMMA something beautiful 
This baby is fully electric 
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent 
[but this second] grows with seven ,COMMA eight percent ,COMMA and then they will end up here .PERIOD 
They will start flying 
Because we already have this [growth] in process 
The year is 1960 
Can you see as the years pass ,COMMA by child survival is increasing 
It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth 
In the front you see ,COMMA actually joe murray ,COMMA getting the patient ready for the transplant while in the back room ,COMMA you see hartwell harrison ,COMMA the chief of urology at harvard actually harvesting the kidney 
That really has to do with our aging population 
It's not really that foreign of a concept ,COMMA actually ,COMMA it happens on the earth every day 
So your body is constantly regenerating 
So ,COMMA how can we harness that power 
That's exactly what you see here 
To the naked eye ,COMMA they look like a piece of your blouse or your shirt ,COMMA but actually these materials are fairly complex ,COMMA and they are designed to degrade once inside the body ,COMMA 
It disintegrates ,COMMA a few months later 
What about other structures 
This is actually an engineered blood vessel 
You now have your fully seeded scaffold 
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder 
We place it back into this oven-like device .PERIOD 
So bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures 
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it 
We exercise these prior to implantation 
All we are left with is the skeleton if you will of the liver ,COMMA all made up of collagen .PERIOD a material that's in our bodies that will not reject 
This is still experimental ,COMMA but we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure .PERIOD experimentally 
So another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together .PERIOD like an accordion ,COMMA if you will 
If at all possible ,COMMA we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate .PERIOD your organs .PERIOD 
Why because we'd rather take those cells ,COMMA which already know that those are the cell types you want 
And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors 
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago ,COMMA stem cells from the amniotic fluid ,COMMA and the placenta ,COMMA which have those properties 
So i always like to show this cartoon 
And there you see the stagecoach driver ,COMMA and he goes on the top panel .PERIOD he goes a b ,COMMA c ,COMMA d .PERIOD e .PERIOD f .PERIOD 
Entrepreneurs are people -- because we have a lot of them in this room -- who have these ideas and these passions ,COMMA or see these needs in the world .PERIOD and we decide to stand up and do it 
And as a young kid ,COMMA nobody can say it can't happen ,COMMA because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out 
If we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial -- the ones that show those traits to be -- like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science .PERIOD what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs 
We could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .PERIOD 
And the media says that it's really cool if we could go out and be a model ,COMMA or a singer or a sports hero ,COMMA like luongo .PERIOD crosby ,COMMA 
Our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs .PERIOD 
We didn't fit in the normal work ,COMMA we couldn't work for somebody else because we're too stubborn .PERIOD and we have all these other traits 
I could go on ,COMMA and on 
Fit into this other system and try to become a student 
I'm also quoted -- and i told the person who wrote the textbook -- i'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook .PERIOD in every canadian university and college studies 
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting 
And i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course 
And my mom came into the room ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm like ,COMMA but you have two cars ,COMMA and they don't have license plate protectors 
So i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each 
But it was obvious to me ,COMMA right .PERIOD buy low sell high 
Don't try to sell to the poor kids .PERIOD they don't have cash .PERIOD the rich people do go get some 
So that's obvious right 
And making money off that too 
I built these little pincushions when i was 11 years old in cubs .PERIOD and we made these pin cushions for our moms for mother's day .PERIOD 
And you'd make these chairs 
You get the golf balls ,COMMA and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks ,COMMA and when you're done ,COMMA you've got a couple hundred of them 
And they could use those for practice balls .PERIOD 
But it paid the bills 
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i'd thrown a penny out in the street .PERIOD and my dad said ,COMMA go ,COMMA pick it up 
But then we negotiate on what they're going to get paid 
You breed ,COMMA that kind of stuff ,COMMA each of my kids has two piggy banks .PERIOD 
The 50 percent that goes in their house account every six months goes to the bank 
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it 
We have all these lessons in front of us ,COMMA but we don't take those opportunities .PERIOD we teach kids to go get a tutor ,COMMA 
My kids love this stuff 
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor 
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities 
Since education ,COMMA under the soviet union was essentially propaganda serving the purposes of a state ideology ,COMMA they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations if they were to provide an education worthy of free men and women 
You may think ,COMMA you know what is going on in that jane austen novel -- that is ,COMMA until your first encounter with postmodern deconstructionism 
When the astronomical distance between the realities of the academy ,COMMA and the visionary intensity of this challenge were more than enough ,COMMA i can assure you to give one pause ,COMMA what was happening outside higher education made backing off unthinkable 
And that was only the beginning 
Incredibly this nation with all its material ,COMMA intellectual and spiritual resources ,COMMA seems utterly helpless to reverse the freefall in any of these areas 
We are playing with fire 
On a more personal note ,COMMA this betrayal of our principles ,COMMA our decency ,COMMA our hope ,COMMA made it impossible for me to avoid the question .PERIOD what will i say years from ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA when people ask ,COMMA 'where were you' as president of a leading liberal arts college ,COMMA famous for its innovative history ?QUESTIONMARK there were no excuses 
The challenge to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .PERIOD 
Even more valuable ,COMMA history provides a laboratory in which we see played out the actual as well as the intended consequences of ideas .PERIOD 
Students in turn continuously ,COMMA move outside the classroom to engage the world directly 
This is a political education to be sure 
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment .PERIOD 
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here ,COMMA needs to turn its attention to that collaborative ,COMMA messy ,COMMA frustrating ,COMMA contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy .PERIOD 
All right ?QUESTIONMARK okay .PERIOD so perfect 
They go to church by which i mean ,COMMA they do lots of things for free for each other 
Now ,COMMA i know you don't believe me really here 
He's a terrible producer of videos ,COMMA but it's great content .PERIOD so i'm going to give you a little bit of it .PERIOD 
So here he is beginning 
This is this fantastic brat pack remix set to lisztomania 
They decided they wanted to do the same 
So that's importantly ,COMMA different from the earlier videos we looked at .PERIOD because here remix isn't just about an individual doing something alone in his basement .PERIOD it becomes an act of social creativity .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA mickey mouse himself .PERIOD of course ,COMMA as steamboat .PERIOD willie is a remix of the then very dominant very popular steamboat ,COMMA bill ,COMMA by buster ,COMMA keaton ,COMMA 
He is the celebration and ideal of exactly this kind of creativity 
But then the company passes through this dark stage to this democrat 
Okay ,COMMA for a second example ,COMMA think about this cultural hero icon on the left .PERIOD creator of this character 
Look at the site that he built star wars ,COMMA mashups inviting people to come and use their creative energy to produce a new generation of attention towards this extraordinarily important ,COMMA cultural icon ,COMMA 
So the point is the republicans here recognize that there's a certain need of ownership ,COMMA a respect for ownership ,COMMA the respect ,COMMA we should give the creator ,COMMA the remixer ,COMMA the owner ,COMMA the property owner .PERIOD the copyright owner of this extraordinarily powerful stuff ,COMMA and not a generation of sharecroppers .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i think there are lessons we should learn here lessons about openness .PERIOD 
Our lives are sharing activities at least in part 
That's number one number two ,COMMA this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create 
And number three ,COMMA we need to respect the creator ,COMMA the creator of these remixes through rights that are directly tied to them 
These tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator ,COMMA because it builds upon a copyright .PERIOD the creator has licensed freely 
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that's obviously developed around these licenses as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there .PERIOD licensed freely in this way .PERIOD 
Now if we can learn those values from ,COMMA at least some influences on the right ,COMMA if we can take them and incorporate them ,COMMA maybe we could do a little trade 
In fact someone on reddit thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA what a great thing we should all vote this up 
And that was that the internet loves ,COMMA mister splashy .PERIOD pants .PERIOD 
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing splashy .PERIOD 
There are so many great publishing tools that are available .PERIOD it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something 
If you want to succeed ,COMMA you've got to be okay to just lose control 
Well ,COMMA we all know the world wide web has absolutely transformed publishing ,COMMA broadcasting ,COMMA commerce and social connectivity .PERIOD but where did it all come from 
Vannevar bush was the us government's chief scientific adviser during the war 
And the memex would link information .PERIOD one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth .PERIOD 
He built a system 
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system 
They had a 12-page supplement in the wall street journal ,COMMA the day it launched 
I thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA interesting ,COMMA but a guy from cern .PERIOD he's not going to do this 
In 1992 his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference 
Secondly ,COMMA for the first time in the modern era ,COMMA the dominant country in the world -- which i think is what china will become -- will be not from the west ,COMMA and from very ,COMMA very different civilizational roots 
Now ,COMMA i know it's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize ,COMMA they also westernize 
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different 
In other words ,COMMA china ,COMMA unlike the western states .PERIOD and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization ,COMMA its existence ,COMMA as a civilization-state .PERIOD rather than as a nation-state 
Well ,COMMA basically the east was swallowed by the west ,COMMA 
Hence ,COMMA their attitude ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the uyghurs and to the tibetans ,COMMA 
This is the chinese view of the state -- very ,COMMA very different to ours 
Know that china believes in the market and the state 
Moreover ,COMMA this is a very old state tradition ,COMMA a very old tradition of statecraft 
And yet ,COMMA we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china by simply drawing on western experience ,COMMA looking at it through western eyes ,COMMA using western concepts .PERIOD 
But it's not 
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA which have been in a far weaker position ,COMMA vis-a-vis the west -- have been thereby forced to understand the west ,COMMA because of the west's presence in those societies ,COMMA 
Because what's happening back to that chart at the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK the goldman sachs chart 
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .PERIOD 
Well ?QUESTIONMARK maybe that's true ?QUESTIONMARK maybe that's an exaggeration .PERIOD 
But there's another problem ,COMMA which goes along with this -- that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future 
Or take this now ,COMMA this is an idea ,COMMA but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing 
Accelerometers on each hand read hand ,COMMA position ,COMMA 
And he was very impressed .PERIOD he was all tearing up .PERIOD ready to hug me .PERIOD 
I must have done about 30000 caricatures 
That evening ,COMMA i came home to hundreds of hate mails ,COMMA hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this 
I was also asked to leave the organization ,COMMA a cartoonists' organization in america ,COMMA that for me was my lifeline .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA my paintings came alive ,COMMA 
The collaborative effort was fabulous 
Since i mentioned my wife ,COMMA the most important collaboration has been with her .PERIOD netra 
I must have been 19 and a half ,COMMA then ,COMMA and it was love at first sight .PERIOD 
I lived in india ,COMMA she lived in america 
Notice one thing we're equal here .PERIOD 
We had fashion designers installation artists models ,COMMA we had makeup artists ,COMMA jewelry designers ,COMMA all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation 
And i had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws .PERIOD 
I could not live this larger than life person 
This time i said ,COMMA let's try something different 
And this was just eight months ago ,COMMA 
I walk into her room ,COMMA and there was a shy girl ,COMMA and she was bald ,COMMA and she was trying to hide her baldness 
I whipped out my pen ,COMMA and i started drawing on her head ,COMMA and i drew a crown for her 
Our computers ,COMMA our systems will be as primitive as the apollo's are for today .PERIOD 
We can develop any part of the body 
The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics 
This would imply a massive leap in migration 
An individual for the first time in the history of humanity will have the capacity by 2030 to destroy the planet to wreck everything through the creation ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of a biopathogen 
More people smaller spaces ,COMMA less stuff .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA i want to use zipcar 
And so from a branding perspective ,COMMA they got a lot right 
Platforms are invitations .PERIOD 
So creating craigslist or itunes .PERIOD and the iphone developer network ,COMMA there are all these networks -- facebook as well 
Essentially there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland ,COMMA near where i live 
And one quick example is velib .PERIOD in 2007 came forward in paris with a very bold proposition ,COMMA a very big bike-sharing service 
We're at the very beginning of something that what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward ,COMMA is inviting ,COMMA it's engaging ,COMMA but it's very early 
You have to make a wish to save the world 
I mean ,COMMA i can't save the world .PERIOD nobody can 
I know those guys 
It was the only one i had at that time ,COMMA 
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves 
So we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis ,COMMA doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver ,COMMA lawyer ,COMMA cooks 
The experts said ,COMMA no way 
We said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's try and push as far as we can 
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK for example ,COMMA that's palestine .PERIOD 
Three kids -- that was three students -- were [detained] by the army because they were not carrying their papers 
We need culture out there 
You see that enough in the media 
What i want to show is the incredible life 
During that time ,COMMA you haven't thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow .PERIOD 
When you look at kibera ,COMMA now ,COMMA they look back 
So we could just walk in the street during the next days ,COMMA and the photos would get revealed by themselves 
So we didn't get caught this time 
Hopefully ,COMMA you'll see the film ,COMMA and you'll understand the scope of the project ,COMMA and what the people felt when they saw those photos 
Because that's a big part of it .PERIOD there's layers behind each photo 
But tell me advertising for what 
The people i photograph were proud to participate in the project ,COMMA and to have their photo in the community ,COMMA 
The importance is what you do with the images ,COMMA the statement it makes where it's pasted 
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally ,COMMA and i pasted it in southern italy ,COMMA where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .PERIOD 
So a subject you're passionate about a person who you want to tell their story ,COMMA or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for 
Einstein's especially interested in penelope's talk 
A lot of her research goes on in caves ,COMMA which can get pretty dusty 
Well that's really cool .PERIOD but what einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut 
That is one big peanut since einstein is a bird .PERIOD she's very interested in things that fly 
E ?QUESTIONMARK [spaceship :COLON noise] sw :COLON even if it doesn't have a laser 
E :COLON [squawks] sw :COLON yeah ,COMMA it sure can ?QUESTIONMARK but when einstein needs to relax from her job ,COMMA educating the public ,COMMA she loves to take in the arts 
Or maybe sirena huang would like to learn some arias on her violin and einstein can sing along with some opera ,COMMA 
E .PERIOD [operatic squawk] sw :COLON very good .PERIOD 
Or maybe stu just needs another backup singer 
You like to drink water 
Again 
E ooooowww 
E .PERIOD goodbye .PERIOD 
And about five years ago ,COMMA we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the uk ,COMMA 
The minister of education down south in london described himself as a big fan 
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you for hour after hour ,COMMA 
I would run into the living room ,COMMA jump up on the couch ,COMMA rip the cushions off ,COMMA throw them on the floor ,COMMA scream at the top of my lungs and run out .PERIOD because i was the incredible hulk .PERIOD 
And i would like to share my art 
So moving onward 
First principles ,COMMA this is very important 
I tried kickboards 
Hand paddles ,COMMA everything 
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward ,COMMA motion 
So let's look at some examples .PERIOD this is terry 
Rather he is entering the water at a 45-degree angle with his forearm ,COMMA and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important 
Below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did ,COMMA which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach ,COMMA no video monitoring 
In freestyle ,COMMA easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll .PERIOD and just to look at your recovery hand ,COMMA as it enters the water .PERIOD 
Then i transferred to a different school sophomore year ,COMMA and i had a choice of other languages .PERIOD most of my friends were taking japanese 
I couldn't believe i was on the other side of the world .PERIOD 
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper 
And that's pretty much .PERIOD my response 
Nothing worked until i found this 
Many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters ,COMMA to facilitate literacy -- some are required to 
And now i love languages 
I was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face ,COMMA never to return to the ballroom dancing club .PERIOD 
Everyone burst into laughter .PERIOD i was humiliated 
So i had a very short deadline for a competition .PERIOD 
These seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete .PERIOD if i wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years ,COMMA 
That photo is of the semi-finals of the buenos aires championships .PERIOD four months later 
Then one month later went to the world championships ,COMMA made it to the semi-final and then set a world record following that .PERIOD two weeks later ,COMMA 
So he can lift the woman to break her .PERIOD for example ,COMMA 
There are many different types 
I have hundreds of hours of footage -- all categorized ,COMMA much like george carlin categorized ,COMMA his comedy .PERIOD 
So fear is your friend fear is an indicator 
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child 
And if any of you are interested in that i would love to speak with you 
But i ask a lot of questions ,COMMA and i would love your advice 
It's written using wiki ,COMMA software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save ,COMMA and it goes live on the internet immediately 
So when yochai is talking about new methods of organization ,COMMA he's exactly describing wikipedia .PERIOD and what i'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside ,COMMA 
And so ,COMMA if you think about what that means ,COMMA it means a lot more than just building a cool website .PERIOD 
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model ,COMMA because that empowers local entrepreneurs -- or anyone who wants to can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it ,COMMA redistribute it and you can do it commercially or non-commercially 
The biggest languages are german japanese french -- all the western european languages are quite big .PERIOD 
So the big question ,COMMA when you've got this really chaotic organization is ,COMMA why isn't it all rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK why is the website as good as it is 
The actual truth about the specific bush-kerry incident is that the bush-kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004 .PERIOD and it wasn't because they were contentious .PERIOD it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage people -- sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalize wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed .PERIOD so quickly ,COMMA 
So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point-of-view policy .PERIOD 
If you engage in that type of behavior ,COMMA you'll be asked to leave the community 
And then users can set up their own personal watch list 
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists ,COMMA because it is sometimes vandalized 
And that's a really important thing to understand is that the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1000 people who are in constant communication 
Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended 
I give this talk sometimes ,COMMA with angela ,COMMA who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the board of the foundation with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it 
Of course ,COMMA the vote ended up being about 85 to 18 .PERIOD so there was no real danger to our democratic processes .PERIOD 
It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased 
Have you found wikipedia being used by teachers ,COMMA and how do you see wikipedia ,COMMA changing education 
It builds on ,COMMA the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers .PERIOD 
I sent it from my harvard email address ,COMMA because i was recently appointed a fellow there 
And so the wiki books project is an effort to do that 
In the jungles of guatemala ,COMMA in tikal stands a temple 
His name was .PERIOD jasaw chan k'awiil 
He lived into his 80s ,COMMA and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 ad 
They've never found a society that did not have it 
It was told by an anonymous kwakiutl indian of southern alaska to a missionary in 1896 .PERIOD and here it is 
It's below your emotions 
It comes from a david mamet play .PERIOD and there's two con artists in the play ,COMMA and the woman is conning the man ,COMMA and the man looks at the woman and says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you're a bad pony .PERIOD i'm not going to bet on you 
So what have i learned from this experiment that i would like to tell the world 
Too old too young too scruffy ,COMMA too stupid ,COMMA and they won't do it 
And in fact ,COMMA sometimes i feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate .PERIOD when i think of how intense this brain system is 
And so i've spent the last three years on this 
And so there's one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature ,COMMA and this reminds me of it 
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men .PERIOD do

Discoveries like fire happened so rarely that from an individual's point of view .PERIOD the world never improved 
Within 40 years ,COMMA physicists discovered the whole explanation ,COMMA expressed as usual ,COMMA in elegant symbols 
But that ability to make progress remained almost unused ,COMMA until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe .PERIOD 
But that can't be what made the difference 
And that rarely if ever caused anything like the scientific revolution ,COMMA 
At the time what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea ,COMMA about things unseen ,COMMA known as empiricism 
In what language certainly not the language of mathematics ,COMMA in which galileo rightly said ,COMMA the book of nature is written 
By the way ,COMMA why don't we do that 
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars 
Some rocks and some finches 
What we see ,COMMA in all these cases ,COMMA bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible -- only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them .PERIOD 
That myth is testable 
It's equally testable 
The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress ,COMMA 
One is well known .PERIOD untestable theories .PERIOD 
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses ,COMMA or you've had laser refractive surgery .PERIOD

But this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it 
They're going to get to land 
But unfortunately ,COMMA 95 percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem 
These ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice 
Here's me in my office

When the liberal team loses as it did in 2004 .PERIOD and as it almost did ,COMMA in 2000 ,COMMA we comfort ourselves 
Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others 
Here are the results 
So as you see people care about harm and care issues ,COMMA 
You picked a particular breed ,COMMA you learned some new information about the breed .PERIOD 
In the first panel ,COMMA we see the moment of creation ,COMMA 
It shoots up ,COMMA and it keeps going up 
I think that's probably right .PERIOD although this is a controversial issue 
It's just a lot of rock ,COMMA and then a lot of water and wind and a lot of time ,COMMA and you get the grand canyon 
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed .PERIOD 
You have the markings of shiva on the right shiva's ,COMMA the liberal god ,COMMA and they work together 
But as we learned from samantha power in her story about sergio vieira de mello .PERIOD you can't just go charging in saying you're wrong .PERIOD and i'm right 
If australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to west papua .PERIOD for example ,COMMA we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow .PERIOD and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go 
So when we have to send someone we send the military -- because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves ,COMMA and not having all this extra support ,COMMA 
One particular thing that's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs ,COMMA we ought to be equipping them differently ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have 
Military personnel are being trained for war .PERIOD so they're trained that as soon as things go bad ,COMMA their first response is lethal force 
And of course ,COMMA being australian i started looking at stuff in australia ,COMMA knowing again ,COMMA from my own experience ,COMMA about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in australia 
This is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone 
This was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms ,COMMA but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons -- and people when they're actually saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA hey ,COMMA there might be some problems -- there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on 
You have to be careful about who you're shooting at 
They were holding something like 700 people hostage 
And it's no surprise that people died ,COMMA because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale ,COMMA what position they're going to fall in when they become unconscious ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
The person who's spraying the oc spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated .PERIOD and so on ,COMMA 
Just in case you think it's only going to happen in the united states .PERIOD it happened in canada as well .PERIOD 
And a colleague of mine sent me this one from london ,COMMA 
I looked at it ,COMMA i was really surprised 
So if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons ,COMMA what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel 
What would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a manned ,COMMA portable version of the active denial system -- a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about it 
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does 
And i found this old video 
With our strengths and our minds and spirit .PERIOD we gather we form ,COMMA and we fashion 
This particular reel -- it's an industrial video -- but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 -- in the detroit area in fact -- and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho .PERIOD 
And when i sat down next to him ,COMMA he was telling me about a company ,COMMA he formed ,COMMA and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the other thing that i think is taking off .PERIOD another reason making is taking off today is there's some great new tools out there 
So they're the brains of maker projects .PERIOD and here's an example of one 
These guys came up with a kit version for 750 dollars ,COMMA and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this ,COMMA and begin playing with 3d printers 
Isn't that cool 
Well ,COMMA he did a little bit better than free 
So we all think we know what glamour is here .PERIOD it is 
It's glamorous movie stars like marlene ,COMMA dietrich 
Fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills ,COMMA and all kinds of glamorous industrial places 
You had a glamour 
There is a process of idealization ,COMMA glorification and dramatization ,COMMA and it's not just the case for people 
Glamour doesn't have to be people 
It puts you into this special special world ,COMMA 
She's not looking away from you exactly ,COMMA but you have to mentally ,COMMA imagine her world 
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs ,COMMA where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture ,COMMA 
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period .PERIOD but because ,COMMA in it's streamlining ,COMMA it transports us from the everyday 
To conceal all art and make whatever is done ,COMMA or said ,COMMA appear to be without effort .PERIOD and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour 
But if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this 
Part of the thing is that in rear window .PERIOD the question is ,COMMA is she too glamorous to live in his world .PERIOD 
And the answer is no .PERIOD but of course it's really just a movie 
So ,COMMA this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour's really partly about meaning 
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace .PERIOD the perfect diamond ring .PERIOD 
This is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia .PERIOD 
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life 
David hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash ,COMMA which only took a fraction of a second to happen .PERIOD 
But i also knew how hard they worked all week .PERIOD 
But as a scientist ,COMMA i'm interested in a different problem of other minds ,COMMA and that is the one i'm going to introduce to you today ,COMMA 
And then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system ,COMMA 
Child what rs pirates ,COMMA really like cheese sandwiches .PERIOD 
This pirate is called joshua 
Now i'm going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .PERIOD 
So the three-year-old does two things differently 
And second ,COMMA when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his ,COMMA where we would say he's taking that one ,COMMA because he thinks it's his .PERIOD the three-year-old comes up with another explanation .PERIOD he's not taking his own sandwich ,COMMA because he doesn't want it .PERIOD because now it's dirty on the ground .PERIOD 
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich .PERIOD 
And we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction ,COMMA but for a moral judgment .PERIOD 
Remember the five-year-old completely understood .PERIOD why ivan took joshua's sandwich ?QUESTIONMARK 
Was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua's sandwich .PERIOD 
He says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches 
And so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people's thoughts ,COMMA be explained ,COMMA in terms of differences in this brain region ,COMMA 
And her friend drinks ,COMMA the coffee and is fine 
And what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region ,COMMA people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA i'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse 
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine 
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm where grace thought that it was poison ,COMMA although it was really sugar people now say it was more .PERIOD okay ,COMMA she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee 
So it's not a surreptitious technology 
So i've got one last question there is this thing called the hard problem of consciousness that puzzles a lot of people 
Why 
Me was composed of stories ,COMMA of cravings ,COMMA of strivings ,COMMA of desires of the future .PERIOD 
Me only existed in the trying 
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth 
I would drive it and demand things from it 
I didn't heed it .PERIOD no ,COMMA i organized it .PERIOD and i directed it 
I took more than my body had to offer 
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection .PERIOD 
Now i am swimming in it 
So we brought her home ,COMMA and i prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA but what's the water part 
It was my whole self melting into michaela's lap 
It was finding my place and the huge responsibility that comes with connection 
It was energy love and joy .PERIOD 
It was all these things 
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down ,COMMA but they want to know how to slow down really quickly .PERIOD so 
So i was in new york recently .PERIOD and i walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course ,COMMA a new evening course ,COMMA 
You know ,COMMA a burnout ,COMMA or eventually the body says ,COMMA i can't take it anymore and throws in the towel .PERIOD 
Am i really in such a hurry that i'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day ,COMMA 
I just thought ,COMMA and i thought long and hard 
And by the time i got off that plane i'd decided i wanted to do something about it 
Time is scarce .PERIOD so what do we do 
And i guess that the question is ,COMMA is it possible to break free from that mindset ?QUESTIONMARK 
And in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration ,COMMA lie what a lot of people .PERIOD now refer to as the international slow movement .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you tap into that -- those deeper ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA psychological ,COMMA emotional spiritual currents ,COMMA and you get a better orgasm with the buildup 
I mean ,COMMA you heard that i got a speeding ticket while i was researching my book on the benefits of slowness ,COMMA and that's true ,COMMA but that's not all of it .PERIOD 
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions ,COMMA 
We fill our head with distraction ,COMMA with busyness ,COMMA so that we don't have to ask .PERIOD am i well .PERIOD am i happy are my children growing up ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's become my reward at the end of the day .PERIOD something i really cherish 
I was downstairs by the front door ,COMMA and i was waiting for a taxi .PERIOD and my son came down the stairs .PERIOD and he'd made a card for me ,COMMA and he was carrying it 
So what i'd like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn's heart ,COMMA which is how do we discover ?QUESTIONMARK what is really particular about a project 
This used to be an island -- ackerman island -- and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs .PERIOD 
And here's the building as it opened with a channel overlooking downtown ,COMMA and as seen from downtown ,COMMA 
Every piece of the building works 
I was very moved by what i saw today 
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site ,COMMA 
And as things are a little easier in india ,COMMA the site was purchased within a week ,COMMA and we were working 
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs -- they're built in concrete and sandstones .PERIOD the roofs are stainless steel -- they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself ,COMMA pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other .PERIOD 
Back to yad vashem ,COMMA three years ago ,COMMA after all this episode began ,COMMA yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built -- the holocaust museum in washington -- and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information 
They said ,COMMA let's rebuild the museum 
And here studying in three dimensions ,COMMA how to give some kind again of order a structure ,COMMA not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that particular process 
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what i've said to the term ,COMMA beauty 
We call a natural object ,COMMA beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness ,COMMA the perfect fulfillment of function .PERIOD 
Nevertheless ,COMMA beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that 
He who seeks truth shall find beauty .PERIOD he who seeks beauty shall find .PERIOD vanity 
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of self-expression ,COMMA he who seeks self-expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance .PERIOD 
My name is kailash .PERIOD and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass .PERIOD 
A rising tide lifts all boats .PERIOD 
It felt like it was really important 
I just really wanted to acknowledge you 
It is really a sacred space .PERIOD 
See these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting 
The only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn't react to it .PERIOD 
It was an opportunity that was missed 
So it's just a season ,COMMA and there are two seasons in most of south asia ,COMMA 
High pressure builds over india ,COMMA 
A few kilometers ,COMMA maybe is quite typical .PERIOD 
And this is called the globe skimmer or wandering glider 
But it really hasn't been studied very much 
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly ,COMMA 
If you're going to study dragonflies ,COMMA you want to study those really bright beautiful ones ,COMMA like that red one ,COMMA or the really rare ones ,COMMA the endemic endangered ones 
And they were there for some time ,COMMA and then they were gone 
And i didn't think anything more of it until the following year ,COMMA when it happened again .PERIOD and then the year after that ,COMMA and then the year after that ,COMMA 
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks ,COMMA 
Those of you who are indian or spent your childhood here ,COMMA let me have a show of hands who of you -- not yet ,COMMA not yet 
So are these things ?QUESTIONMARK how are these things getting here ?QUESTIONMARK 
It stretches about 500 miles .PERIOD of course .PERIOD it's india here 
When do you see ,COMMA the dragonflies appear 
And then the southernmost maldives 
So i started a very rigorous scientific process 
It doesn't make sense .PERIOD there is nothing for them .PERIOD in maldives ,COMMA 
And we're starting in june ,COMMA so this is the monsoon rain 
Nothing for these dragonflies ,COMMA there is no more seasonal rain 
They're looking for somewhere to breed .PERIOD if it rains here ,COMMA they'll breed 
They'll hatch out in six weeks ,COMMA by that time ,COMMA the seasonal rains have moved on .PERIOD it's not there .PERIOD it's down here .PERIOD 
They'll fly down here .PERIOD and the clever thing is ,COMMA the wind is always converging to where the rain is 
So the little fellow that hatches out here ,COMMA he gets up into the air .PERIOD he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling .PERIOD 
So in four generations ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD and then back 
A complete circuit of the indian ocean 
There is more to the story 
Which is an area along the amur river ,COMMA which is up here ,COMMA 
He's an engineer 
Half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military-industrial project of the modern era ,COMMA 
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb 
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it 
It's never allowed to be photographed 
There are clouds right 
The leuna chemical plant after one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks ,COMMA 
So i would like to invite you also for a while ,COMMA to the himalayas themselves 
And to show the place where meditators ,COMMA like me ,COMMA who began with being a molecular biologist in pasteur institute and found their way to the mountains 
I just wrote an essay on happiness ,COMMA and there was a controversy 
As pascal said ,COMMA even the one who hangs himself ,COMMA somehow is looking for cessation of suffering -- he finds no other way .PERIOD 
Although we want to avoid suffering ,COMMA it seems we are running somewhat towards it .PERIOD 
And that can also come from some kind of confusions ,COMMA 
It is something that -- changes of nature ,COMMA 
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment ,COMMA a state that actually pervades and underlies all emotional states .PERIOD and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way 
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad in a way ,COMMA why not 
But there's also wicked joy .PERIOD you can rejoice in someone's suffering 
We know by experience that we can be what we call a little paradise .PERIOD and yet be completely unhappy within 
The experience that translates everything is within the mind 
We have to know from ourselves ,COMMA there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing ,COMMA to this well-being ,COMMA what the greeks called eudaimonia ,COMMA flourishing ,COMMA 
Just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature ,COMMA 
For that we have to ask ,COMMA what is nature of mind 
And if we look from the experiential point of view ,COMMA there is a primary quality of consciousness .PERIOD that's just the mere fact to be cognitive to be aware .PERIOD 
Usually when we feel annoyed ,COMMA hatred or upset with someone or obsessed with something ,COMMA the mind goes again ,COMMA and again ,COMMA to that object ,COMMA 
But we think we could sit on the cloud -- but if you go there ,COMMA it's just mist 
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation .PERIOD 
So that's what those great meditators have been doing 
If you are happy about something ,COMMA you'll go more to the left side 
Here the -05 is the full standard deviation of a meditator .PERIOD who meditated on compassion 
So i've no time to go into all the different scientific results 
Some meditators ,COMMA without trying to stop it ,COMMA but simply by being completely open thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event ,COMMA like a shooting star .PERIOD they are able not to move at all 
So the whole point of that is not sort of to make ,COMMA like a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump ,COMMA or whatever 
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education .PERIOD 
I'm not going to show you a presentation .PERIOD i'm going to talk to you 
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have .PERIOD so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do ,COMMA but are so often unable in the real world ,COMMA to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective ,COMMA 
It's going to be different than here 
To give you an idea of scale .PERIOD second life is about 20000 cpus at this point 
And let me justify that with two statements 
And i think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know ,COMMA that 3d ,COMMA that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us .PERIOD 
Second life originally had 16 simulators it now has 20000 
And we had -- we zoned it .PERIOD you know ,COMMA we put a nightclub ,COMMA we put a disco where you could dance .PERIOD and then we had a place where you could fight with guns .PERIOD if you wanted to ,COMMA and we had another place that was like a boardwalk ,COMMA kind of a coney island 
And so the existence of an economy is critical 
The question is ,COMMA there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life ,COMMA 
And so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that's happening inside .PERIOD second life is quite -- i think quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we've ever been able to achieve 
Other questions right here 
What's your demographic 
In terms of psychographic -- oh ,COMMA men and women men and women are almost equally matched in second life .PERIOD so about 45 percent of the people online right now on second ,COMMA life are women 
In terms of psychographic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to them and meet them .PERIOD and i would ,COMMA you know ,COMMA challenge you to just do this and find out 
If you count ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA cities ?QUESTIONMARK so -- but i did -- and i didn't do -- i think i didn't do as well in school ,COMMA as i could have ,COMMA i think you're right .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA so let me restate that 
So you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA much of human life ,COMMA and human experience may move into the digital realm 
That's a frightening change ,COMMA frightening disruption .PERIOD 
I guess and you're asking ,COMMA what do i think about that ?QUESTIONMARK how do i -- jh :COLON what's your response to the people who would say ,COMMA that's horrifying 
(audience ,COMMA if someone would say to you ,COMMA i find that disturbing ,COMMA what would be your response) pr :COLON well ,COMMA i'd say a couple of things 
Now ,COMMA the problem of human diversity ,COMMA like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-questions 
What we're asking about ,COMMA though is human ancestry .PERIOD 
Digging things up out of the ground and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped ,COMMA often skull shape -- saying this looks a little bit more like us than that .PERIOD so this must be my ancestor ,COMMA 
You think you've got a tough job .PERIOD 
Now a quick primer on dna .PERIOD 
Mitochondrial dna ,COMMA tracing a purely maternal line of descent .PERIOD 
Turn them on their sides ,COMMA combine them ,COMMA so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom ,COMMA and the branches going up 
Was it millions of years ago ,COMMA which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world 
Why was it that we seem to have come out of africa ?QUESTIONMARK so recently 
What was going on to the world's weather around 60000 years ago ,COMMA 
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere 
Now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience ,COMMA basically ,COMMA there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA you want the ultimate african success story .PERIOD 
Look in the mirror ,COMMA you're it .PERIOD the reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa -- probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now around 60 ,COMMA 70 thousand years ago -- allowing us not only to survive in africa ,COMMA but to expand out of africa .PERIOD 
These would have been savannah hunters ,COMMA 
Entering europe around 35000 years ago and finally ,COMMA a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable .PERIOD siberia inside the arctic circle .PERIOD during the last ice age -- temperature was at -70 ,COMMA -80 ,COMMA even -100 ,COMMA perhaps -- migrating into the americas .PERIOD ultimately ,COMMA reaching that final frontier ,COMMA 
The changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures ,COMMA allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i've just been on 
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples 
The human genome project or a mars rover ,COMMA mission 
In this case you actually can 
And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated 
And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way .PERIOD the universe works 
And yet look around us 
Now we move forward 380000 years 
But that's not completely true .PERIOD 
Recent studies by satellites such as the wmap satellite have shown that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there are just tiny differences in that background 
We have our first stars 
So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity ,COMMA 
So it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean 
And that's why as a species ,COMMA we're so creative and so powerful .PERIOD and that's why we have a history 
And then from about 500 years ago ,COMMA humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains ,COMMA through telegraph ,COMMA through the internet ,COMMA until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals 
We've been on a journey ,COMMA a return journey of 137 billion years .PERIOD 
And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role .PERIOD 
Collective learning is a very ,COMMA very powerful force .PERIOD and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it .PERIOD 
The program in a sense ,COMMA is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance 
How many of you have iphones 
And that's what i really want to focus on today ,COMMA 
And what i'm going to talk about today is save more tomorrow .PERIOD 
First thing to notice is half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan .PERIOD 
And they get overwhelmed ,COMMA and the just don't join 
Suppose we had another wonderful ted event next week 
The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later ,COMMA 
Self-control is not a problem in the future 
Nobody checks boxes 
We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401 choices .PERIOD 
They're really mad 
We first implemented it richard thaler and i back in 1998 
We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise 
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period ,COMMA four pay raises people who were struggling to save were saving three percent of their paycheck .PERIOD three .PERIOD and a half years later ,COMMA saving almost four times as much almost 14 percent 
It's been part of the pension protection act

And when that ax hits that piece of wood ,COMMA that's when everything will destroy .PERIOD and the big bang will happen .PERIOD again .PERIOD 
But all before that ,COMMA there was a woodcutter 
So every time i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem .PERIOD and so i got over the problem 
If we do not create the stories ,COMMA we probably go mad 
Are you with child

The children's television host .PERIOD mr .PERIOD rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker ,COMMA that said ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love .PERIOD once you've heard their story 
And the way i like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment ,COMMA which is make me care -- please ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA intellectually ,COMMA aesthetically ,COMMA just make me care 
And so if i were going to give you the ending of this story ,COMMA it would go something like this ,COMMA and that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .PERIOD 
He insisted ,COMMA no embalming ,COMMA no open coffin ,COMMA no funeral .PERIOD 
It didn't happen to me ,COMMA it happened to somebody else .PERIOD but it's going to be worth your time .PERIOD

And it's something that always drove all his choices .PERIOD 
Wall-e's was to find the beauty 
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them 
But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it .PERIOD

Are we going to work with 15 billion producers ,COMMA 
If we work with those ,COMMA if we change those companies and the way they do business ,COMMA then the rest will happen automatically 
Because if these companies demand sustainable products ,COMMA they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production 
By companies asking for this ,COMMA we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it 
After 40 years ,COMMA the global organic movement has achieved 07 of one percent of global food .PERIOD 
We can't wait that long 
We need change that's going to accelerate 
So it's the demand that brings them to the table 
So we're pulling out all the stops 
They're doing it with ibm and the usda ,COMMA and they're putting it in the public domain ,COMMA because they want everybody to have access to this data ,COMMA because they want everybody to help them make cocoa more productive and more sustainable .PERIOD 
If you divide the amount of water into what the farmer was paid ,COMMA the farmer ,COMMA didn't receive enough money to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities 
This is called bundling .PERIOD it's bringing those externalities back into the price of the commodity ,COMMA 
We can't just focus on identifying the best .PERIOD we've got to move the rest 
And i'm honored to meet you the future leaders of great britain and this world 
And my mother ,COMMA the most important role model in my life who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters ,COMMA malia .PERIOD and sasha 
That's why all of this that you're going through -- the ups and the downs ,COMMA the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't -- why it's so important 
And having done ,COMMA so these women moved many obstacles 
I liked being smart 
I liked being on time i liked getting my work done 
History proves that it doesn't matter whether you come from a council estate or a country estate ,COMMA 
In the white house ,COMMA there's the desk that he sits at -- it's called the resolute ,COMMA desk 
She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in rochester ,COMMA new york .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA the human voice is the vessel on ,COMMA which all emotions travel -- except perhaps jealousy 
When you're totally in the moment ,COMMA when i'm totally in the moment ,COMMA the vessel of expression is open 
The emotions can flow from me to you and back 
It's called aria 
For example ,COMMA there are different colors ,COMMA and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop country and western opera ,COMMA jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color 
They had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network 
So unusual ,COMMA in fact that it was said that it's not clear the internet could work 
Now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination 
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust ,COMMA which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA last year ,COMMA the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube 
And here is the message ,COMMA where one of them says looks like .PERIOD we've got a live one .PERIOD we have a hijacking of youtube 
And today ,COMMA wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus 
I am not making this up 
And there are a bunch of people who on a sunny day ,COMMA would rather be inside and monitoring this ,COMMA the administrator's notice board ,COMMA itself a wiki page that anyone can edit 
There are spambots crawling it ,COMMA trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch 
It's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it 
Here is just a snapshot of some of them 
If you do it will be removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision ,COMMA but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is a 2005 business week .PERIOD cover 
Yeah ,COMMA i know number four ,COMMA it's like can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday 
This one says ,COMMA bucolic meadow with split-rail fence 
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later .PERIOD this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere ,COMMA big .PERIOD if you don't mind 
And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it 
And we now have means that we can build like this system ,COMMA so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it 
Why there is the craigslist rideshare board .PERIOD 
If it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board ,COMMA tumbleweeds would be blowing through it 
But it's the rideshare board ,COMMA and it's basically the same thing 
It's a bee that yes ,COMMA flies 
We all live in the same planet ,COMMA but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world 
And by and large ,COMMA this has failed 
Aid actually ,COMMA did the opposite 
So 12 years ago ,COMMA i was trying to be an investment banker in new york 
And it reminded me of a day in 1971 
And after all poor countries like rich countries ,COMMA one thing we've got equal is their days are the same length .PERIOD 24 hours 
The question was ,COMMA how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh 
It turns out 2000 dollars 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA if the cost of installing a telephone is going down ,COMMA because there's a digital revolution going on ,COMMA then it would be even more dramatic 
But in any event ,COMMA it's connectivity .PERIOD that leads to dependability 
There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones 
The work pays them a salary ,COMMA the salary allows them to pay for the car over time 
The car pays for itself 
See you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA the internet was booming in the us 
And she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan 
And these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company 
It's just an experiment 
I was a guest student during one month of a public ,COMMA health course 
They read the textbook twice or three times or four times 
And they were the first to twitter transatlantically 
Those are nice words ,COMMA but i got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty and liberty for whom 
But really ,COMMA really natural sovereignty was good for japan 
In 1947 ,COMMA india finally gained its independence .PERIOD 
You can see that the health started to improve 
In '92 ,COMMA india follows with a market reform 
And they go quite closely together ,COMMA and you can see that the similarity with india and china in many ways are greater than the differences with them 
Kerala is flying on top there matching united states in health ,COMMA but not in economy 
We have an enormous disparity in the world 
You see china under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the indian level here 
Japan did it like this until full catch up ,COMMA and then they follow with the other high-income economies 
Can be worse can be better 
But more recently ,COMMA i've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale 
By invisible ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum .PERIOD 
When those measurements are made instead ,COMMA what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance 
In fact ,COMMA this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible ,COMMA dark matter 
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly 
Now ,COMMA how do we deduce where the galaxy is 
Where will this observer ,COMMA see the galaxy 
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone -- that will all be bent by that cluster ,COMMA and make it into the observer's eye ,COMMA 
So actually at home ,COMMA whenever we break a wineglass ,COMMA i save the bottom .PERIOD take it over to the machine shop .PERIOD 
We shave it off ,COMMA and i have a little gravitational lens .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
And we see these gravitational lensing effects ,COMMA these distortions that say that ,COMMA again ,COMMA clusters are embedded in dark matter .PERIOD 
They're moving away from each other ,COMMA because space itself is getting bigger .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
So in the last century ,COMMA ok ,COMMA people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever .PERIOD whether it would slow down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA will be slowing down ,COMMA but continue forever ,COMMA slow down and stop ,COMMA asymptotically stop ,COMMA or slow down ,COMMA stop and then reverse .PERIOD so it starts to contract again .PERIOD 
By how much less is it expanding today ,COMMA compared to say ,COMMA a couple of billion years ago ,COMMA 
So we need something to be able to explain that 
But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
They haven't seen anything ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are 
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year ,COMMA and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this 
Now ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy ,COMMA so it will be hard to tell the difference 
And finally for future endeavors .PERIOD there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes ,COMMA and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition ,COMMA right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy 
And over the course of half an hour ,COMMA not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped 
They started with two ,COMMA and they ended with two 
In china .PERIOD recycling is a major issue 
And they use them in the breaks for water pistols ,COMMA 
And they are having great fun 
And they squirt the water into their mouths 
You load it up in the normal way ,COMMA this is made on existing equipment .PERIOD in 14 factories that we license 
Imagine that orchestration 
This happens every year 
And one time he came up to me -- he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me 
And there was a wasp's nest that i had let grow in my yard ,COMMA right outside my door .PERIOD 
And like ,COMMA knock like a woodpecker on my door ,COMMA until i opened it up 
And i told him ,COMMA you know ,COMMA cody ,COMMA the wasps actually made that 
They're the people who make the bullet train 
And those bumps act like a magnet for water ,COMMA 
And the fog comes in ,COMMA and it builds up on the tips .PERIOD 
Now it's reversing that equation and actually sequestering half a ton of co2 .PERIOD thanks to the recipe from the coral ,COMMA 
They actually export water molecules through 
And those scalloped edges play with flow in such a way that is reduces drag by 32 percent 
The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful way to innovate 
And we are in a long ,COMMA long line of organisms to come to this planet and ask ourselves .PERIOD how can we live here gracefully over the long haul 
Now in order to do this ,COMMA the design challenge of our century ,COMMA i think we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses ,COMMA and to somehow ,COMMA meet them ,COMMA again ,COMMA 
And we're working with eol encyclopedia of life .PERIOD ed wilson's ted wish 
And this is a pretty well-educated audience .PERIOD so i imagine you all know something about aids 
If you know something more ,COMMA you probably know that uganda ,COMMA to date is the only country in sub-saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic 
But i'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem .PERIOD that's more .PERIOD traditionally part of public health and epidemiology 
We see almost no change in sexual behavior .PERIOD 
Aids is the same kind of thing .PERIOD it's costly to avoid aids 
And the way that i'm going to do that is i'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria 
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria 
Even if you only cared about aids in africa ,COMMA it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria ,COMMA in combating poor indoor air quality ,COMMA in improving maternal mortality rates .PERIOD 
If people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own ,COMMA even if they know everything about the disease ,COMMA they still may not change their behavior 
We know they had this campaign .PERIOD that's how we learn about .PERIOD what works 
So this is another way to see this 
So i am going to talk about exports and prices 
But openness and inter-connectedness ,COMMA it comes with a cost when we think about disease .PERIOD i don't think this should be a surprise .PERIOD 
Areas with a lot of economic activity -- with a lot of roads with a lot of urbanization -- those areas have higher prevalence than others .PERIOD 
And what's really really great about being here is i'm sure that the questions that you guys have are very ,COMMA very different than the questions that i think up myself 
It's great being here at ted 
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth 
It reminds us that we are a part of nature ,COMMA and we're not separate from it 
Well ,COMMA their answer was ,COMMA it's all about risk and reward 
And chip taylor ,COMMA our monarch butterfly expert .PERIOD he replied ,COMMA nothing lasts forever 
And that blew my mind 
We were four girls and no boys 
I don't know if he really meant [that] ,COMMA but it happened 
Out of 100 90 are your creation 
This is about tough policing ,COMMA equal policing .PERIOD 
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer .PERIOD 
Here i got a prison assignment 
Obviously it was 
And then how did i deal with them 
The first day when i went in ,COMMA i didn't know how to look at them 
I said ,COMMA do you pray do you want to pray 
I think that's the bigger change .PERIOD 
Teachers were prisoners .PERIOD teachers were volunteers 
You want to know more about this go and see this film doing time doing vipassana 
Let me wrap it up 
But the best part is the message that the yahoo ,COMMA help desk got about .PERIOD 20 minutes later ,COMMA 
Captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over 10 years ago ,COMMA and it's been used everywhere 
So then i started feeling bad 
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds 
So you start with a book ,COMMA and then you scan it 
For example ,COMMA for things that were written more than 50 years ago ,COMMA the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words 
Johnedwardscom ,COMMA so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .PERIOD 
There are tens of thousands of these 
Some of them are very cute 
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .PERIOD 
It hasn't yet been launched .PERIOD it's called duolingo 
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student ,COMMA severin hacker 
Actually it was a forum post 
Remember it's a question about javascript .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so computer translation ,COMMA not yet good enough 
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web 
We could do that 
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into spanish ,COMMA it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited ,COMMA outsourcing country out there 
So it would be very expensive 
For example .PERIOD in the united states alone ,COMMA there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language .PERIOD 
There's of course ,COMMA a lot of very simple sentences on the web 
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users ,COMMA we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .PERIOD 
So here's the site 
But then ,COMMA by the end of the decade ,COMMA the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement 
We the children had gathered at a friend's house 
I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections 
And there ,COMMA i started by searching for the footprints in my childhood 
The polling stations opened to the voters at 700 ,COMMA am but voters ,COMMA eager to take their own political fate into their hands ,COMMA were starting to line up at 400 am in the morning .PERIOD 
They were chanting .PERIOD we want peace 
Now ,COMMA the uphill battle for ghana ,COMMA and for africa is not over ,COMMA but i have proof that the other side of democracy exists ,COMMA and that we must not take it for granted 
That -- you know ,COMMA i was born thinking about things that way ,COMMA and i had always been like a little scientist guy 
And people in the 17th century ,COMMA they didn't really understand the same way we do about ,COMMA you know .PERIOD this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules ,COMMA and we breathe it in for a purpose ,COMMA and all that 
And boyle said bullshit .PERIOD 
And so charles said ,COMMA i'm going to put up the money .PERIOD give you guys a building come here ,COMMA and you can meet in the building ,COMMA but just don't talk about religion in there .PERIOD 
But experimental science had been tied up with all those things 
Kary mullis ,COMMA they might have done it for the teddy bear .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD 
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way 
I was thinking about making my own little rockets 
That's why i thought as long as i don't blow my eyes out ,COMMA 
I may not care about the fact that it's prohibited from heating this solution .PERIOD 
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets ,COMMA or it wouldn't be in that manual 
And it -- they burned 
At any rate ,COMMA i bring it up because it's a good story .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA tell personal things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and that's a personal -- i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife ,COMMA but that would be too personal .PERIOD wouldn't it 
But in the actual process ,COMMA you get an idea -- like when i got the idea ,COMMA one night that i could amplify dna with two oligonucleotides ,COMMA and i could make lots of copies of some little piece of dna .PERIOD you know ,COMMA the thinking for that was about 20 minutes ,COMMA while i was driving my car .PERIOD and then ,COMMA instead of going -- i went back ,COMMA and i did talk to people about it .PERIOD but if i'd listened to what i heard from all my friends ,COMMA who were molecular biologists -- i would have abandoned it 
But i knew you'd go into the lab ,COMMA and you'd try to make it work yourself ,COMMA and then you're the authority .PERIOD and you can say ,COMMA i know it works because right there in that tube is where it happened .PERIOD and here on this gel ,COMMA there's a little band there that i know that's dna .PERIOD and that's the dna .PERIOD i wanted to amplify so there .PERIOD so it does work 
So you have to be honest 
Now let's see 
They made bigger guns to shoot them ,COMMA down with 
And the people i'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called ,COMMA say the inter-governmental panel on climate change .PERIOD 
So the planet should get warmer 
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing .PERIOD you know ,COMMA it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful ,COMMA and it does all kinds of things .PERIOD we don't know anything about 
In new york city ,COMMA rats are part of commuters' daily lives .PERIOD 
I was very fond of this space ,COMMA because it's the first massive industrial complex .PERIOD i found on my own that is abandoned 
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex 
I was really frightened at first ,COMMA but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project ,COMMA and he didn't seem to mind .PERIOD and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .PERIOD 
That homeless man ,COMMA to me ,COMMA really represented an element of the unconscious of the city .PERIOD 
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century ,COMMA the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats ,COMMA so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place 
As you can see the system is very complex and vast 
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do 
I think we agree on that ,COMMA where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK where does all this stuff come from 
And would you be able to kind of draw a -- you don't have to draw the diagram ?QUESTIONMARK but would you be able to draw the diagram ?QUESTIONMARK if you had to do it ?QUESTIONMARK or would you just say ,COMMA that's actually not possible 
That's what plants actually do for a living 
So these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models ,COMMA 
And it's amateur ,COMMA but amateur in the best sense .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA the root of the word being of love and passion 
And governments do very well ,COMMA they pat themselves on the back 
Ok ,COMMA we collude .PERIOD and actually ,COMMA if you -- if someone had designed a test for me ,COMMA when i was doing my biology exams ,COMMA to really understand to see whether i'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air .PERIOD then i might have done better at science 
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology ,COMMA 
But within that infrastructure ,COMMA we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution 
This is a dead crystal ,COMMA and i'm going to do something to it ,COMMA and it's going to become alive 
But there's a problem because up until maybe a decade ago ,COMMA we were told that life was impossible ,COMMA and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .PERIOD 
If we can make matter alive ,COMMA would we have a matterhazard ?QUESTIONMARK 
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease 
You can decode the genome ,COMMA you can look back ,COMMA you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna .PERIOD but we can't get further than the last ancestor .PERIOD the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .PERIOD 
What is life ?QUESTIONMARK what is this stuff of life ?QUESTIONMARK 
So the whole area's been stuck for a while ,COMMA and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on 
And the answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA lies with mice 
They're all made of the same stuff ,COMMA but they want their shape to win 
And that is the key 
Let's zoom out to what that could mean 
If we could get evolution into the material world ,COMMA then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution .PERIOD 
And that's really worth thinking about 
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution 
So you imagine if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form ,COMMA not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive .PERIOD it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies ,COMMA because we can then use software control for evolution to code in 
But not only just that we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .PERIOD 
Evolution cannot be cut apart 
And we're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .PERIOD 
We are here today because [the] united nations have defined goals for the progress of countries 
Look here -- you have to end poverty ,COMMA education ,COMMA gender child and maternal health ,COMMA control infections ,COMMA protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .PERIOD 
That's a four percent reduction per year -- and this with measuring 
I'll prove them wrong on both points 
And i will take kenya as an example .PERIOD 
I was actually on friday sitting in front of my computer ,COMMA and i saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 ,COMMA just that morning ,COMMA 
That's unfair 
Had i been in the ministry of health in kenya ,COMMA i may have joined these two points 
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa 
I give you congo ,COMMA which was high ghana -- lower and kenya -- even lower 
Their countries are so different ,COMMA and they merit to be recognized in the same way ,COMMA as we don't talk about europe as one place .PERIOD 
There we are today 
How the heck could they be [a] developing country ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look -- even if we look in africa -- these are the african countries 
It's very clear that this is what happens 
That is ,COMMA when we get girls in school ,COMMA we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later ,COMMA which is a secular trend ,COMMA which is very strong .PERIOD 
It's a decent life for children .PERIOD we are talking about 
Do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day ,COMMA the so-called bottom of the pyramid .PERIOD 
But if you don't have money ,COMMA what happens 
And if they do ,COMMA so then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the conditions improve ,COMMA and they start riding on scooters .PERIOD 
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done 
They combine all that 
And it was that compassion ,COMMA which bothered them ,COMMA because when he saw -- in fact ,COMMA he told me about eight or nine years ago ,COMMA how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain ,COMMA a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant 
For example ,COMMA how we started ,COMMA ratan just began with a five-engineer team .PERIOD young people .PERIOD in their mid-twenties ,COMMA 
It was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome 
And the seat riser ,COMMA for example ,COMMA serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity 
And british motor was around 11000 
And unbelievably in 40 years ,COMMA i was the first indian to be honored 
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks ,COMMA [unclear] and functions 
Are you getting more drugs ,COMMA because you are spending more time and more money 
The ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms ,COMMA 
And incubator costs 2000 dollars 
But then he held it for a little while lakshmi 
That gave me a great message focus ,COMMA and you can achieve 
And currently i'm president of global research alliance ,COMMA 60000 scientists in nine counties ,COMMA right from india to the us 
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground ,COMMA raise on the ground or pull out of the ground ,COMMA basically animal ,COMMA mineral vegetable 
Long-distance telephone service sold on price .PERIOD price ,COMMA price .PERIOD fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing .PERIOD and even the internet is commoditizing not just goods ,COMMA but services as well .PERIOD 
Now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience ,COMMA i talk about disney -- the world's premier experience-stager .PERIOD 
And then i always finish off by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question ,COMMA particularly coming from .PERIOD the dutch is that the netherlands is every bit as manufactured as disneyland .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you can look at how each of these economies developed that each one has their own business imperative ,COMMA matched with a consumer sensibility 
Because all businesses are man-made objects .PERIOD all business is involved with money .PERIOD all business is a matter of using machinery and all those things make something inauthentic 
At the end of a laundry list of advice ,COMMA he's giving to his son laertes .PERIOD he says this ,COMMA and this above all ,COMMA to thine own self ,COMMA be true .PERIOD 
As businesses ,COMMA are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
And of course ,COMMA if you are both true to yourself and are what you say you are ,COMMA then you're real real 
Universal city walk is a real fake -- in fact ,COMMA we got this very term from ada .PERIOD louise huxtable's book the unreal america 
But is it really true to itself 
So she calls it a real fake 
So understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future 
Right if you could check into the ads ,COMMA you'd have a great experience 
Then you have that perception that you are phony 
A few words about how i got started ,COMMA and it has a lot to do with happiness ,COMMA actually 
I would make things for people as a way of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA giving showing them my love 
So it has to end with this -- -- gratuitous violence 
So that was how i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it 
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surgeon ,COMMA because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way 
When i see objects ,COMMA i imagine them in motion 
That's about that big ,COMMA 
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry ,COMMA where the found object is ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the puppet ,COMMA and i'm the puppeteer at first ,COMMA because i'm playing with an object 
And they would coalesce for just a moment ,COMMA so you could perceive that there was a chair there .PERIOD 
What would i love 
So this is a little wire-bending tool 
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool .PERIOD and then i made this other tool for sort of centering gears very quickly -- sort of developing my own little world of technology .PERIOD 
And the idea ,COMMA their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street .PERIOD and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best 
So i'll just let this chair come down 
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies .PERIOD 
25 days ,COMMA heart chamber developing 32 days ,COMMA arms &amp .PERIOD hands are developing 36 days ,COMMA beginning of the primitive vertabrae these weeks are the period of the most rapid development of the fetus 
51 days 52 days ,COMMA developing retina ,COMMA nose and fingers the fetus' continual movement in the womb is necessary for muscular .PERIOD and skeletal growth 
Every six months until they're six years old -- we're going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us 
I'm a spectroscopist 
Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny ,COMMA weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun .PERIOD 
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae 
It's the only place where you can produce ,COMMA actually ,COMMA osmium 
It was incredible .PERIOD the only conclusion we could make from .PERIOD this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system ,COMMA which polluted the atmosphere of this star 
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien .PERIOD it comes from a different galaxy 
And sometimes they just capture stars 
We were very surprised to discover a super flare ,COMMA a flare which is thousands of millions of times ,COMMA more powerful than those we see in the sun 
This can be done with the future spectrographs .PERIOD 
Coming back to the most important question is there ?QUESTIONMARK anybody out there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward 
It's exactly the same game ,COMMA a very tiny feature 
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum 
Now very recently ,COMMA very recently ,COMMA i'm talking about last six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight months ,COMMA water ,COMMA methane ,COMMA carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .PERIOD 
And with the known physics ,COMMA etc .PERIOD it's something actually ,COMMA which has been pointed out .PERIOD by frank drake ,COMMA many years ago and shklovsky 
They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines ,COMMA in the spectrum of a star in different ways .PERIOD 
And we are doing this job since 2000 ,COMMA and it's a very heavy project 
We have been working very hard 
I think it will come from a spectrum like this 
It will take about five years 
And she said ,COMMA but the thing i liked about your talk is ,COMMA you're a storyteller .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA i'm going to call you a storyteller .PERIOD 
I'm a qualitative researcher 
And maybe i'm just a storyteller .PERIOD 
The other thing that they had in common was this .PERIOD they fully embraced vulnerability .PERIOD 
They're willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out 
Do you have any recommendations 
And i said ,COMMA i'm great .PERIOD i'm okay .PERIOD 
I just need some strategies 
And then i said it's bad right 
The problem is -- and i learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion 
You can't numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects our emotions 
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .PERIOD 
There's no conversation 
Which just i hope in 100 years ,COMMA people will look back and go .PERIOD wow .PERIOD 
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand ,COMMA our job is not to say ,COMMA look at her .PERIOD she's perfect 
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh grade ,COMMA 
We do that in our personal lives ,COMMA 
It is as you can see very small and also very cheap .PERIOD 
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement ,COMMA we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement ,COMMA for self-discovery ,COMMA self-awareness ,COMMA self-knowledge .PERIOD 
Some people will say it's for public health research 
Thank you 
I want to talk about it in the context of a story .PERIOD 
All of our statuses are different 
All of our hopes and dreams ,COMMA what we want to accomplish is different ,COMMA and our paths will be different .PERIOD they are all stories 
And go from this concept of walking breathing ,COMMA and then his hands speak ,COMMA and ultimately happiness and function .PERIOD 
And we took this ,COMMA and we converted it into data 
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time 
So ,COMMA here's steven alone ,COMMA sharing this story in the world 
We need to give to others to be successful 
And i'm going to show you what patients like me the company that myself ,COMMA my youngest brother and a good friend from mit started 
But you can aggregate this ,COMMA and you can discover things about treatments 
So you can see the duration 
I'm going to log in 
And this is a new version of our platform .PERIOD we're launching right now 
I'm taking three drugs to manage it ,COMMA some of them are experimental 
So can i take this data -- rearrange yourself ,COMMA put the symptoms in the left ,COMMA the drugs across the top ,COMMA tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else ,COMMA and what interacts 
Doctors actually love this sheet ,COMMA and they're actually really engaged 
Ten percent of the people in our system ,COMMA took lithium 
It's never going to work .PERIOD you can't do it 
And then we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA how do we line them all up 
And it works almost every time 
And yeah ,COMMA all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation .PERIOD we'll do that later .PERIOD 
We hired them set them up ,COMMA assisting at lab 
Because something went different 
And i am thankful 
We know what they are 
The b15 iceberg broke off the ross ice shelf ,COMMA 
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy ,COMMA the electron 
A tremendous amount of energy is coming at us from the sun 
Wouldn't it be really great .PERIOD if the window could flick back the heat into the room ,COMMA if we needed it or flick it away before it came in 
We'd have to see at night ,COMMA right 
But because it's flexible it can be on any surface whatsoever .PERIOD 
It was in actually a diner outside of dallas/fort worth airport ,COMMA 
Ebox ,COMMA is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside ,COMMA hold it until you need it ,COMMA and then be able to release it and pass it off .PERIOD 
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend 
I'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists ,COMMA no kinder than many of the people in the world .PERIOD but they have a magic look at the world 
By any standard ,COMMA this is wrong 
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean ,COMMA i'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that i wanted to do .PERIOD and i wanted to play war 
And on the other side were all my sister's my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .PERIOD 
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possible ,COMMA 
With one broken leg 
I can delete that dot ,COMMA because that's clearly a measurement error .PERIOD 
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses ,COMMA is how in a statistically valid way .PERIOD do we eliminate the weirdos 
When i applied to harvard ,COMMA i applied on a dare 
I didn't expect to get in ,COMMA and my family had no money for college 
Which i'm glad you liked ,COMMA but they did not like that at all 
Here's how we get to health ,COMMA we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success 
Doctors are 19 percent faster ,COMMA more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative ,COMMA neutral or stressed ,COMMA 
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula .PERIOD so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of 
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters 
And by the way ,COMMA all of these numbers are significantly higher ,COMMA if you happen to be black ,COMMA if you happen to be poor ,COMMA if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school ,COMMA 
And so we're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences .PERIOD in the university ,COMMA 
The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures .PERIOD there are fewer male teachers 
But male role models for boys ,COMMA that say it's all right to be smart -- they've got dads .PERIOD they've got pastors they've got cub scout leaders .PERIOD but ultimately ,COMMA six hours a day five days a week .PERIOD they're spending in a classroom .PERIOD and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist .PERIOD 
This is a place for girls 
We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there 
And if you ask title 1 teachers ,COMMA they'll tell you they've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades 
All of those conversations need to be happening 
Who has a computer ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok ,COMMA so everyone has a computer 
I went to mit did my math ,COMMA but i had this wonderful opportunity because computers had just become visual 
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs 
I didn't quite get it and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a crusty designer ,COMMA like a good -- kind of like a good french bread 
This is the first sort of play thing .PERIOD i did my own serious play 
This is actually bad human experiments .PERIOD 
See humans don't know how to take orders .PERIOD the computer's so good at it .PERIOD 
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you pen do this ?QUESTIONMARK and you pen do this 
And after this ,COMMA i wanted to build a computer out of people called a human-powered computer 
I have behind this wall a disk drive :COLON a cpu a graphics card a memory system 
On the computer ,COMMA when you move your mouse ,COMMA that arrow moves around 
I have no staff ,COMMA it's all kind of made by hand -- these sort of broken hands 
So ,COMMA naomi was pivotal in that 
So if you can see here ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that program you're seeing in the corner ,COMMA if you spread it out ,COMMA it's all these things all at once ,COMMA 
You get it ?QUESTIONMARK no ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
They're littler computers ,COMMA so the one-chip computers ,COMMA i began to program one-chip computers and make objects out of pc boards leds 
I did a show in london last year ,COMMA made out of ipods -- i used ipods as a material 
We have this gene defect in our mind 
This is from the cape last year 
This is also out there .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
And i went after it with passion ,COMMA 
I was like .PERIOD aha .PERIOD wait .PERIOD a second 
So thank you .PERIOD everyone 
What is it about flying cars ,COMMA 
But we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning ,COMMA you see something that really ,COMMA truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that i don't know about you ,COMMA but i really enjoy spending time in 
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground .PERIOD this may be counter-intuitive ,COMMA but driving has potholes ,COMMA cobblestones ,COMMA pedestrians ,COMMA other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with 
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit ,COMMA and the wings come out 
Radio 2 that was gorgeous 
The transition will cost in line with other small airplanes 
And i'm certainly not out to replace your chevy .PERIOD but i do think that the transition should be your next airplane 
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved .PERIOD 
The question was given to a bunch of engineers about 15 years ago .PERIOD how do we make the journey to paris better 
What you should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels ,COMMA pay them to walk the length of the train ,COMMA handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey 
They seem fantastic to me ,COMMA they cost very little to develop 
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education .PERIOD 
Before long ,COMMA there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in germany ,COMMA 
Now boring ,COMMA people would have just simply banned the veil ,COMMA 
All value is perceived value .PERIOD 
These funny signs that flash your speed at you ,COMMA some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face ,COMMA to act as an emotional trigger 
The wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry ,COMMA 
The interesting thing is that for 50 years .PERIOD hence ,COMMA the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn't made of gold ,COMMA or diamonds ,COMMA 
It was made of cast iron ,COMMA 
Because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry .PERIOD this actually had symbolic value ,COMMA badge value 
If you think about it ,COMMA shakerism was a proto-environmental movement 
And that what we add on top is kind of false .PERIOD it's a fake version 
However ,COMMA what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value ,COMMA and it's much fairer 
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving 
I would say ,COMMA it's a work of genius 
So i just want to get your first impressions when you see that ,COMMA when you see the diamond shreddies box there ,COMMA 
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six ,COMMA if you flip it over ,COMMA it looks like a nine 
Thank you very much indeed ,COMMA 
We're seeing the consequences all around us 
I would say not just biological design ,COMMA but all of the design that we think of as human design 
And 100 pages later ,COMMA 
And another 100 pages later ,COMMA 
Or design out of chaos without the aid of mind ,COMMA 
Chaos ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA what mind no 
But that it will get copied if it can ,COMMA regardless of the consequences 
This is design process going on 
A meme is not equivalent to an idea 
Audience sink ,COMMA toilet 
This has spread all over the world 
So this is a view of what humans are 
And indeed ,COMMA in the short time ,COMMA i've already been at ted ,COMMA i see we're even closer than i thought .PERIOD we were before 
We'll think we're choosing these things .PERIOD but the temes are making us do it 
It's been very productive that equation 
Getting a new replicator is dangerous .PERIOD 
We may take the gaian view 
You know ,COMMA all about big brains 
And why would they do that 
So those are the two possibilities 
I have no idea 
I was afraid of a tsunami ,COMMA what i didn't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti .PERIOD and that was building collapse 
After all ,COMMA it was the buildings ,COMMA not the earthquake that killed .PERIOD 220000 people that injured 330000 ,COMMA that displaced 13 million people that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation .PERIOD 
Behind that door is the national judicial archives 
Now there's a solution to all these problems 
And because i had 70 percent of my body burned ,COMMA it would take about an hour 
So originally ,COMMA i didn't have much money ,COMMA so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter's vice 
Now ,COMMA ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system .PERIOD so we said ,COMMA why don't we get people to sign the honor code 
And this is particularly interesting ,COMMA because mit doesn't have an honor code 
No bill ever disappeared 
We did not pay them with dollars .PERIOD we paid them with something else .PERIOD 
But this did not solve the big problem i had with enron yet because in enron .PERIOD there's also a social element .PERIOD 
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment .PERIOD and we told them that at the end ,COMMA we asked them to pay us back the money .PERIOD they didn't make .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
What would happen to the other people in the group ,COMMA 
Will they cheat more ,COMMA or will ,COMMA they cheat less 
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon ,COMMA students 
When we remind people about their morality ,COMMA they cheat less 
But unless we start testing those intuitions ,COMMA we're not going to do better 
Okay ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA cèilidh first of all is gaelic for party ,COMMA but kitchen party in cape breton ,COMMA is very common ,COMMA and basically somebody drops into the house ,COMMA and no matter what house you go to in cape breton ,COMMA there's a fiddle there ,COMMA guaranteed .PERIOD and i'd say ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's first of all more fiddlers per capita in cape breton than anywhere in the world .PERIOD so ten chances to one the fellow who walked in the door could play it .PERIOD so you'd have someone come into the house ,COMMA you'd invite them to play a tune ,COMMA and lo and behold ,COMMA a little party would start up and somebody would dance ,COMMA and somebody would sing and all that sort of thing .PERIOD so it was a wonderful wonderful way to grow up .PERIOD and that is ,COMMA where my beginnings in music come from my surroundings ,COMMA my family ,COMMA just my bloodline in itself .PERIOD and oh ,COMMA i've done lots of things with my music 
Donnell leahy .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD i'm kind of new to the ted experience ,COMMA and i'm glad to be here .PERIOD but i'm just trying to put it all together ,COMMA trying to figure all you people out .PERIOD and i've been here for a short while ,COMMA and i'm starting to understand a little bit better 
We learned to play the instruments ,COMMA but we kind of had to come from within ,COMMA or go from within ,COMMA because we didn't watch television .PERIOD we didn't listen to a lot of radio .PERIOD we went to church and to school sometimes ,COMMA and farmed and played music .PERIOD so we were able ,COMMA i think at a very critical age to develop our own style ,COMMA our own self ,COMMA and my mother plays my father plays .PERIOD and the style that came from the ottawa valley in ontario ,COMMA we call it french-canadian style ,COMMA but it originated in logging camps 
Airs were played in europe at burials ,COMMA as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site ,COMMA the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player .PERIOD 
We're laughing like ,COMMA because our styles are totally different .PERIOD as you can hear 
Announcer ,COMMA great news ,COMMA they're running late downstairs .PERIOD 
When she got up to make tea ,COMMA she placed him in my own lap ,COMMA and i had never felt a child that was that emaciated .PERIOD 
Single mother ,COMMA hiv positive 
I photographed her before ,COMMA and after the birth of her beautiful baby girl issa 
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter ,COMMA like so many other zimbabwean children who've been orphaned by the epidemic 
And i was constantly reading the new york times ,COMMA and stunned by the statistics ,COMMA the numbers 
So i quit my job and decided that that's the subject that i wanted to tackle 
We've known about fusion since 1920 ,COMMA when sir arthur stanley eddington ,COMMA and the british association for the advancement of science conjectured that that's why the sun shines 
And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources .PERIOD i got very upset about as upset .PERIOD as i did when i realized that the earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun .PERIOD 
Energy at the moment is dominated by resource 
It's a medium-sized nucleus 
And indeed ,COMMA that's exactly what stars do .PERIOD 
So that's that process there deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium .PERIOD 5 
And that energy is what powers fusion 
And as you go across there ,COMMA you see a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line ,COMMA by the way is the lowest estimate of existing resources 
And as you go across there ,COMMA you will see that we've got a few tens of years ,COMMA and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left 
So ,COMMA how would we make it 
We can do fusion in the center of this device .PERIOD we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997 
If you want to know how ask yourself this question ,COMMA what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail 
Because when you ask it ,COMMA you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you ,COMMA how it keeps us from attempting great things ,COMMA and life gets dull ,COMMA amazing things stop happening 
The path to truly new ,COMMA never-been-done-before things always has failure along the way 
In october of 1903 ,COMMA the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly 
40 years later ,COMMA aero experts coined the term transonic 
Since we took to the sky ,COMMA we have wanted to fly faster and farther 
It's boosted to near-space atop a minotaur iv rocket 
That's an unnatural act for a rocket 
The third stage has a camera 
This is the actual rocketcam footage from flight .PERIOD one 
Now to conceal the shape ,COMMA we changed the aspect ratio a little bit .PERIOD 
This is a hummingbird drone 
It does not eat nectar 
Or perhaps spider man will one day ,COMMA be gecko .PERIOD man :COLON 
Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44000 degrees fahrenheit -- hotter than the surface of the sun .PERIOD 
Using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain .PERIOD tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm 
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life 
They are nerds ,COMMA and they are heroes among us .PERIOD 
There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you 
Well ,COMMA i don't think we ultimately know what it will be right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's actually look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters 
Well ,COMMA look our singular mission is the creation ,COMMA and prevention of strategic surprise ,COMMA 
That's what we do 
And you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention ,COMMA but at a personal level ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA i can't imagine doing your job 
But quite frankly ,COMMA on this issue ,COMMA there is no other road .PERIOD 
Sorry ,COMMA this was my mother by the way .PERIOD in her bead shop in london ,COMMA 
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference 
And the british government saying you need to be in the top five 
But you just have to go to a garden center ,COMMA and they're in little paper packets 
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue 
And the government agreed to do that ,COMMA and not do anything else and focus our energy on that 
This is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .PERIOD 
I'm sorry about my stupid voice there 
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom ,COMMA we could take that bit and put it at the top ,COMMA where the greater commercial value is for a property developer 
Thank you 
June cohen ?QUESTIONMARK so thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD thomas ?QUESTIONMARK you're a delight 
Well ,COMMA that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .PERIOD 
The self changed got affected ,COMMA broken destroyed ,COMMA but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger .PERIOD sometimes hateful ,COMMA sometimes not wanting to be there at all 
The self was not constant .PERIOD 
But nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born 
It was the first time that i existed inside a fully-functioning self -- one that i controlled .PERIOD that i steered ,COMMA that i gave life to 
Well ,COMMA i thought i had the answer to that one ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA skin color ,COMMA 
For a start ,COMMA we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves 
I take it to therapy 
And in that disconnected state ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we can build factory farms with no windows ,COMMA destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .PERIOD 
Thank you for listening 
You can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture ,COMMA looking at me with some concern 
And here is another picture of them 
They are supposed to be locked up 
And i became increasingly more and more agitated ,COMMA because i was there not only to be with them ,COMMA but also to ride and create a team ,COMMA and i didn't know what to do 
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain ,COMMA and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here .PERIOD 
I've had it 
It took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do 
At the beginning ,COMMA it was a disaster 
I tried harsh words and threats ,COMMA and they took me .PERIOD nowhere 
Go away you maniac-psychopath 
And i would say relax .PERIOD alex ,COMMA 
So for such a kid ,COMMA when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn't walk away from him in any situation ,COMMA irrespective of how he behaves .PERIOD it's a tremendous healing experience .PERIOD 
Now i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology 
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .PERIOD 
All you have to do is play with it change it a little bit and come up with something that does help that does work 
Or you can also look back in time and realize that you've already conquered steeper mountains before 
And so we talked about these special words that we teach them 
In every one of these rides i always end up standing in one of these incredible locations taking in this incredible landscape around me .PERIOD and i feel blessed and fortunate that i'm alive ,COMMA and that i sense every fiber .PERIOD in my aching body 
The blank slate was an influential idea in the 20th century 
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues ,COMMA in which they -- using mri -- measured the distribution of gray matter -- that is ,COMMA the outer layer of the cortex -- in a large sample of pairs of people 
And as you can see large amounts of the brain are not purple showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex ,COMMA in that region ,COMMA so does his fraternal twin 
And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna -- namely ,COMMA clones or identical twins .PERIOD 
Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates ,COMMA we can perfect mankind -- the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering 
And so when thomas jefferson wrote in the declaration of independence ,COMMA we hold these truths to be self-evident .PERIOD that all men are created equal .PERIOD he did not mean .PERIOD we hold these truths to be self-evident .PERIOD that all men are clones 
That is ,COMMA because the human mind is a complex system with many parts ,COMMA and some of them can inhibit others 
For example .PERIOD there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense ,COMMA and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the night is young ,COMMA but the book has been out for half a year ,COMMA and nothing terrible has happened .PERIOD 
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies -- appears to be a human universal ,COMMA 
A paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf ,COMMA and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that 
I mean ,COMMA this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form .PERIOD in the 15th century .PERIOD here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book 
And the job in question was sheep rancher ,COMMA 
This one was actually around the playing cards .PERIOD i got yesterday ,COMMA but it had a certain familiarity to it 
Albert is the shepherd in question 
Albert goes in ,COMMA i follow albert the crew ,COMMA is around 
I say ,COMMA time out stop 
We don't fool around ,COMMA we don't rehearse -- we shoot what we get 
And i'm like ,COMMA i don't know what just happened ,COMMA but there are testicles in this bucket ,COMMA and that's not how we do it 
He says ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
Gets up walks to the corner ,COMMA it's quivering ,COMMA and it lies down .PERIOD and it's in obvious distress .PERIOD 
He's like a day 
And i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time 
Melanie picks up the lamb ,COMMA puts it on the post ,COMMA opens it up 
I do 
And i'm like ,COMMA what is this jacked-up metaphor ?QUESTIONMARK 
Anagnorisis is the greek word for discovery .PERIOD 
That's peripety or peripeteia .PERIOD 
It's crushing when the audience sees it ,COMMA the right way 
Looking at that poor other little thing that i'd done it ,COMMA the right way on .PERIOD and i just was struck by if i'm wrong about that ,COMMA and if i'm wrong so often ,COMMA in a literal way ,COMMA what other peripatetic misconceptions might i be able to comment upon 
I mean ,COMMA these are the people that i work with every single day 
Because dude ,COMMA you know four years 
You know ,COMMA follow your dreams and go broke right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Right 
They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first ,COMMA the business of getting it done 
Most hazardous environment i'd ever seen ,COMMA and i was back with a guy ,COMMA lashing the pots down 
I scamper down ,COMMA i go into the wheelhouse ,COMMA and i say ,COMMA with some level of incredulity ,COMMA captain osha .PERIOD 
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work as a society ,COMMA all of us 
We turn them into heroes ,COMMA or we turn them into punch lines 
I just know that that's a front in this war .PERIOD 
And i realized probably too late in this game -- i hope not because i don't know if i can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can 
It's been great talking to you and get back to work ,COMMA will you 
Democracy as a type of politics is a technology for the control and deployment of power 
I would put it in the following equation .PERIOD no 9/11 ,COMMA no war .PERIOD 
Islam represents a way of engaging the world through which one can achieve certain desirable goals 
You can show the capitol -- i had the same problem when i was designing the cover of my forthcoming book ,COMMA in fact -- what do you put on the cover to show democracy 
You can show a mosque ,COMMA or you can show worshippers ,COMMA but there's not a straightforward way of depicting islam 
These are contested points ,COMMA and it's impossible to answer them by saying ,COMMA ah ,COMMA ha .PERIOD i looked in the right place .PERIOD and i found out what these concepts mean 
And i think that that's in fact ,COMMA probably the first appropriate response ,COMMA 
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing that islam and democracy are technologies 
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted .PERIOD to make it 
They were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there .PERIOD why 
Now what i want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope .PERIOD in this case ,COMMA is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the muslim world 
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally ,COMMA began to emerge from the gulf of mexico .PERIOD last year ,COMMA during the horrific bp oil spill a german biologist .PERIOD by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying ,COMMA we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released 
And the local seabird rescue center ,COMMA named sanccob ,COMMA immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken 
I was a penguin aquarist at the new england aquarium 
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time ,COMMA 
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity ,COMMA this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring 
Now mind you three days earlier ,COMMA we had 60 penguins under our care .PERIOD so we were definitely overwhelmed .PERIOD and just a bit terrified -- at least i was 
And you may notice they're wearing very thick gloves .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA why don't we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled -- they collected 20000 -- and we'll ship them 500 miles up the coast to port elizabeth :COLON in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there ,COMMA and let them swim back home 
About a year prior to this oil spill ,COMMA a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser .PERIOD 
Just look at that 17 year-old 
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming 
And i was doing some rather controversial religious programs 
This went down very well ,COMMA in the uk ,COMMA where religion is extremely unpopular .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy .PERIOD 
You behave in a committed way ,COMMA and then you begin to understand the truths of religion 
Why because in compassion ,COMMA when we feel with the other ,COMMA we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world ,COMMA and we put another person there .PERIOD and once we get rid of ego ,COMMA then we're ready to see the divine 
And in particular ,COMMA every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said -- and put at the core of their tradition ,COMMA what's become known as the golden rule 
Hillel ,COMMA stood on one leg and said ,COMMA that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor .PERIOD that is the torah .PERIOD the rest is commentary 
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point ,COMMA i think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group .PERIOD your own nation ,COMMA your own co-religionists ,COMMA your own fellow countrymen .PERIOD you must have what one of the chinese sages called jian ai .PERIOD concern for everybody love .PERIOD your enemies ,COMMA honor .PERIOD the stranger ,COMMA 
And this again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion -- abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who when i say to them ,COMMA what i do for a living ,COMMA inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong ,COMMA 
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation ,COMMA is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing .PERIOD the test of the time 
I was part of that ,COMMA united nations initiative ,COMMA called the alliance of civilizations ,COMMA which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes of extremism ,COMMA and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism

It is the story factory .PERIOD one of the very best in the world 
But they all have one thing in common .PERIOD they all need to look like something

On the way there it's going to completely revolutionize medicine and health care .PERIOD that's obvious 
What we're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future .PERIOD 
That is going to be the it challenge of the next generation is communicating all this information

Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away ,COMMA but not that far away -- going in and altering the genes in the first cell .PERIOD in an embryo ,COMMA 
People can try and ban these things 
Other people are going to say ,COMMA this is great 
And from the beginning of today's sessions ,COMMA you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible ,COMMA difficult painful period that we struggled through

We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet ,COMMA as they have been here .PERIOD now till we hit ,COMMA the second microbial age ,COMMA 
And that's the fate of a planet ,COMMA too ,COMMA 
All along it was thought to be either an act of god ,COMMA or perhaps long slow climate change .PERIOD and that really changed in 1980 ,COMMA in this rocky outcrop near gubbio ,COMMA where walter alvarez trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks ,COMMA which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils 
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet 
This is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon 
But there's lots of stuff 
This is called paleontological child abuse 
And the what i think is that we returned over and over again ,COMMA to the pre-cambrian world that first microbial age ,COMMA and the microbes are still out there 
And the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field 
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period .PERIOD

Your voice is small ,COMMA but don't ever stop singing 
But there are plenty of things .PERIOD i have trouble understanding 
Spoken word poetry is the art of performance ,COMMA poetry 
And step three began when i realized that i didn't have to write poems that were indignant ,COMMA if that's not what i was 
And actually phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name 
And the first list that i assign is 10 things i know to be true 
At a certain point ,COMMA you would realize that someone has the exact same thing ,COMMA or one thing very similar to something on your list

The question is ,COMMA how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self-loathing .PERIOD 
As a young ,COMMA middle-class nigerian activist ,COMMA i launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to stop the government .PERIOD 
I justified it .PERIOD and i said ,COMMA this is the cost of revolution 
Have i not myself been imprisoned 
And so they said ,COMMA tell me about africa ,COMMA professor abani ,COMMA 
There are no essential africans ,COMMA and most of us are as completely ignorant ,COMMA as everyone else about the continent we come from .PERIOD and yet we want to make profound statements about it .PERIOD 
Gazelle ,COMMA i killed you for your skin's exquisite touch for how easy it is to be nailed to a board weathered raw as white butcher paper .PERIOD 
Rise and walk away like a panther 
Also the person sitting in your very seats is a liar .PERIOD 
I watch that tv show 'lie to me' .PERIOD i know you're lying 
They use it to get to the truth ,COMMA and they do what mature leaders do everyday .PERIOD they have difficult conversations with difficult people sometimes during very difficult times 
Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie 
Deception is actually serious business .PERIOD 
It's woven into the fabric of our daily ,COMMA and our business lives ,COMMA 
Koko was taught to communicate via sign language 
And i need to go back to work for the american people 
Now if bill clinton had said ,COMMA well ,COMMA to tell you the truth or richard nixon's favorite in all candor ,COMMA he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter than knows that qualifying language as it's called ,COMMA qualifying language like that .PERIOD further discredits the subject .PERIOD 
Freud had it right 
With body language ,COMMA here's what you've got to do 
Now we're going to look at the hot spots 
We say yes ,COMMA we shake our heads .PERIOD no 
And we're going to see that in several videos ,COMMA moving forward ,COMMA but we're going to start -- for those of you who don't know him this is presidential candidate .PERIOD john edwards who shocked america by fathering a child out of wedlock 
But i'm happy to participate in one 
It's the only asymmetrical expression .PERIOD 
And these were surfaced by researcher david matsumoto in california 
And you'll see when you see the video ,COMMA she can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother 
Diane downs at night when i close my eyes ,COMMA i can see christie reaching her hand out to me ,COMMA while i'm driving ,COMMA and the blood just kept coming out of her mouth .PERIOD 
Now i'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother .PERIOD erin runnion ,COMMA confronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court 
Now the technology around what the truth looks like ,COMMA is progressing on ,COMMA the science of it 
I do now after learning about all the quantum stuff 
They fight they get back up .PERIOD you know ,COMMA wouldn't this be cool 
This is a clay maker 
You know how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur 
You can see how old this stuff is 
And i'm really not very good at it 
This is a -- you can see the little window there 
So this is a quick tale .PERIOD i'm going to tell this is the furby tale ,COMMA 
So this is my family 
I try to do a lot of philosophy ,COMMA a lot of thinking about all of these projects 
You can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor 
I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic 
He didn't test so well ,COMMA but i like him 
And then she started doing these other images 
I have three girls ,COMMA and they just they -- it's like a rescue animal thing .PERIOD they're going there 
And on the weekend ,COMMA we ran the parts for that 
So this is how they come out close to the end 
For a while they were making two million furbys .PERIOD a month 
And she still actually has those 
And we're going to try to really pull this off ,COMMA intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive .PERIOD 
And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these 
Very ,COMMA very obsessive 
And then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA and then more sculpting ,COMMA 
John do you want to bring him up 
Yeah ,COMMA they're like kids ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
That's what the investors think that it's just -- -- right right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA they're really sweet little guys 
Now ,COMMA these are not robots ,COMMA they're kind of lovebots ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
We -- actually it's very hard to keep people from doing this 
And there's a lot of social responsibility in that 
If they can do that ,COMMA why can't governments and ngos do the same thing 
So that's why i took a bit of time to study coke 
They have this very continuous feedback loop 
They said ,COMMA you roll the ball .PERIOD you hear .PERIOD some pins go down 
It's dark ,COMMA you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on .PERIOD and then you an see your impact 
Real-time data turns on the lights 
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers ,COMMA and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people ,COMMA who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product 
The government noticed in ethiopia ,COMMA that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic ,COMMA they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic ,COMMA 
The third component of coke's success is marketing 
Let's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin' flag by a somali hip hop artist 
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries 
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop ,COMMA 
We know that circumcision reduces hiv .PERIOD infection ,COMMA by 60 percent in men 
But it turns out the men do because they're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it .PERIOD and the men also ,COMMA believe it improves their sex life 
So what's the endgame 
So if coke's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness ,COMMA i'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms 
To me that is deep happiness 
Thank you 
This is my baseline .PERIOD this is the mediterranean coast with no fish ,COMMA bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae 
This is their baseline .PERIOD this is what they think is natural ,COMMA because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems 
What have we learned from these places 
When we went to pristine reefs ,COMMA we realized that the natural world was upside down .PERIOD this pyramid was inverted 
The top head does account for most of the biomass in some places ,COMMA up to 85 percent like kingman reef ,COMMA which is now protected .PERIOD 
Then you go to palmyra atoll ,COMMA that has more biomass of herbivores ,COMMA and the dead corals are clean ,COMMA and the corals are coming back .PERIOD 
And this is what i saw lots of fish 
And this particular place the medes islands marine reserve is only 94 hectares ,COMMA and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy ,COMMA 20 times more than fishing ,COMMA and it represents 88 percent of all the tourist revenue 
These places when we protect them ,COMMA if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby ,COMMA this is what happens 
The abundance ,COMMA how many fish you have per square meter increases almost 170 percent 
If you fish less ,COMMA you're actually catching more 
Another example :COLON nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef 
When i went there for the first time in 2000 ,COMMA there were only 3000 groupers left 
It happened in many places around the caribbean 
So ,COMMA how much of this do we have 
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing 
The problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict ,COMMA where the political cost is really low .PERIOD and the economic cost is also low 
But what about the rest of the coast of the world ,COMMA where people live and make a living out of fishing 
How could 85 percent survive on 15 percent 
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain ,COMMA they reproduce very fast .PERIOD they grow really fast .PERIOD they produce millions of eggs 
So really our picture of a food pyramid is just -- we have to change that completely 
We think this is universal 
So the numbers you presented really are astonishing 
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these pristine areas and seeing things coming back 
And if it were not for these places that show hope i don't think i could continue doing this job .PERIOD 
And the problem ,COMMA i think is that we take the ocean for granted 
Most of the animals are in the oceans 
We use the submarine alvin and we use cameras ,COMMA and the cameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of sony 
Marcel proust said ,COMMA the true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes 
It's got tentacles dangling ,COMMA swirling around like that 
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space ,COMMA that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored 
They're very little understood 
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet 
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes 
And we're over the atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the caribbean central america and end up against the pacific ,COMMA nine degrees ,COMMA north 
Here's where bill's cameras really do shine .PERIOD 
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed ,COMMA hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .PERIOD 
Not only is it coming out of the earth -- so ,COMMA biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .PERIOD 
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .PERIOD 
Oh good going 
This is a female of this kind of worm 
You watch ,COMMA it doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight 
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine .PERIOD alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents ,COMMA 
It's actually a light-sensing organ 
This one's several stories tall .PERIOD 
This stuff is toxic as hell .PERIOD by the way 
That's probably where we evolved from 
There's a fish sitting here 
Here's a crab with his claw ,COMMA right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out 
The worms are growing inches per week ,COMMA 
Despite that these animals grow back in about a year's time ,COMMA 
Learn to manage it 
So i'd like to talk about why that is why that's such a calamity for society .PERIOD what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher ,COMMA 
This is really destructive 
David milch ,COMMA creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this 
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes ,COMMA three commercial breaks .PERIOD and a laugh track .PERIOD 
In all seriousness ,COMMA here's an example from a physics .PERIOD textbook 
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that 
So i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math 
The math serves the conversation .PERIOD the conversation doesn't serve the math 
I like this question ,COMMA it's about a water tank .PERIOD 
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .PERIOD 
We need more patient problem solvers .PERIOD thank you 
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best ,COMMA but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet ,COMMA latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional ,COMMA high-cost solutions ,COMMA which depend on professionals ,COMMA which is what schools and hospitals are 
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year for the next 30 years 
This is where you'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world 
Or you can go to places like this 
This is kibera ,COMMA which is the largest slum in east africa 
Millions of people living here ,COMMA stretched over many kilometers 
They're private schools .PERIOD there are no state schools in slums 
It's not to do with electricity or water ,COMMA 
If you want to design from scratch virtually any service in africa ,COMMA you would start now with the mobile phone 
This is a place called the madangiri settlement colony ,COMMA which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi ,COMMA where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .PERIOD 
Ten years ago ,COMMA they certainly would have been married 
This is the best you can get in hyderabad in indian education .PERIOD 
But they find it completely obvious to use computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make videos ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD 
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation ,COMMA that education has a payoff 
That's too long if you're poor 
So you need education to be relevant and help people to make a living there ,COMMA and then often 
Our education systems you do all that stuff afterward .PERIOD if you're lucky ,COMMA sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music 
So el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning 
Taio rocha ,COMMA uses making soap ,COMMA as a technology of learning 
And i learned it from this guy ,COMMA who is an amazing character 
And it also supports working-class kids going into indian schools .PERIOD 
And it's the same ,COMMA wherever you go 
It's reliable ,COMMA and people know exactly where they are 
Why can't we do it more like the chinese restaurants 
There are big picture schools in the us and australia ,COMMA 
But because so many of the issues in education aren't just in school ,COMMA they're in family and community .PERIOD what you also need definitely is more on the right hand side .PERIOD 
You need efforts to supplement schools 
That's an entire second adult lifetime that's been added to our lifespan .PERIOD 
But many people today -- philosophers ,COMMA artists ,COMMA doctors ,COMMA scientists -- are taking a new look at what i call the third act .PERIOD the last three decades of life ,COMMA 
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood 
I've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject 
Obviously ,COMMA there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth 
It was about a man named neil selinger -- 57 years old ,COMMA a retired lawyer -- who had joined the writers group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer's voice 
It's a terrible disease .PERIOD it's fatal 
If ,COMMA however ,COMMA we can go back and alter our relationship ,COMMA re-vision our relationship to past people and events ,COMMA neural pathways can change 
I mean as girls ,COMMA we start off feisty -- yeah ,COMMA who says 
We have agency 
But very often many ,COMMA if not most of us when we hit puberty ,COMMA we start worrying about fitting in and being popular 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding ,COMMA and that's more intelligent in a way because the pollen ,COMMA they don't need so much of it .PERIOD 
The insects and other species can take the pollen ,COMMA transfer it directly to where it's required 
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects ,COMMA 
These are the anthers of a lily ,COMMA cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it ,COMMA the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with 
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that ,COMMA and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar ,COMMA 
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant .PERIOD it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end ,COMMA you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant ,COMMA if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .PERIOD 
And when the insect gets there and lands on it ,COMMA dousing itself in pollen ,COMMA of course ,COMMA that it's going to take to another plant .PERIOD if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture ,COMMA you can see that there are actually some patterning there ,COMMA which is three-dimensional 
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect even to us 
So flies love this 
They lay their eggs in it thinking ,COMMA it's a nice bit of carrion ,COMMA and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs that the eggs are going to die .PERIOD but the plant ,COMMA meanwhile ,COMMA has benefited because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate .PERIOD the next flower -- fantastic 
This thing does something else ,COMMA which is unusual 
Recently a wise media theorist .PERIOD tweeted ,COMMA the 19th century culture was defined .PERIOD by the novel ,COMMA the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema .PERIOD and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface 
And i believe this is going to prove true 
And that's us down there in la and long beach on the bottom 
This is baron wolfgang von kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine .PERIOD 
And i think it's a pretty valid question .PERIOD 
He draws sheep after sheep .PERIOD 
So this is a clip from charlie chaplin's ,COMMA modern times 
That's all i'm getting paid for this 
So we resynthesized this song 
And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice 
After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted .PERIOD you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .PERIOD 
I'm sorry for this 
And this was seen by a director in la named james frost who said ,COMMA wait a minute 
And i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers .PERIOD but we also open sourced it ,COMMA and we made it released as a google code project ,COMMA where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it 
So we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash ,COMMA 
Collaborator five as much as is different from frame to frame .PERIOD it really is personal 
But there's a bunch of different styles 
There is a real problem with snobbery .PERIOD 
Imagine that snobbery is a distinctively uk phenomenon .PERIOD fixated on country houses and titles .PERIOD 
Snobbery is a global phenomenon 
Now ,COMMA the opposite of a snob is your mother 
Think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable ,COMMA and in need of love 
We're told from many sources that anyone can achieve anything 
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please 
They own their success ,COMMA but they also own their failure .PERIOD 
But i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic .PERIOD it's an impossible dream .PERIOD 
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others ,COMMA and it exists 
And then are fit for ridicule 
Now is there any alternative to this 
And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans ,COMMA and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
When banking is no longer so respectable .PERIOD we lose interest in banking 
But what i really want to stress is by all means success .PERIOD yes ,COMMA 
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice ,COMMA 
But it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
It's a smiling face 
And when i said ,COMMA i'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim ,COMMA and we're coming into the dock after a long day ,COMMA and it's now night ,COMMA and we come in ,COMMA and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes .PERIOD and i can touch the dock ,COMMA and we're done .PERIOD the trainer says that's great 
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and cnn's crew ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And there are sharks 
And i gathered together ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA the world's leading experts in every possible way ,COMMA 
And a month ago ,COMMA the 23rd of september i stood on that shore ,COMMA and i looked across to that long ,COMMA long faraway horizon .PERIOD and i asked myself ,COMMA do you have it 
You're really left alone with your own thoughts .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA you're going to hit obstacles 
And even though you're feeling great at any one moment ,COMMA don't take it for granted be ready .PERIOD because there's going to be pain .PERIOD there's going to be suffering 
After a couple of days three days ,COMMA you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .PERIOD 
I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm 
He's 29 years old ,COMMA very well-built ,COMMA lean ,COMMA he's six-foot .PERIOD five weighs 265 lbs .PERIOD and he is down 
I need help ,COMMA and i can't help ,COMMA diana 
The box jelly again -- all across the neck ,COMMA all across here ,COMMA 
We've got benadryl on board if i get stung ,COMMA i'll just grin and bear it 
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft .PERIOD tentacles ,COMMA 
Henry ?QUESTIONMARK what's your question 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit .PERIOD but yeah ,COMMA i know those guys 
He said ,COMMA that's what you need 
Thank you 
This hope is still alive 
Are you going to swim the atlantic 
I said ,COMMA nope .PERIOD i didn't know 
And i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs 
They come in a lot of different shapes ,COMMA 
So i'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .PERIOD 
So i did a series of work where it was identical words in french ,COMMA and in english ,COMMA 
So if you don't know one of these languages it's instant learning 
It's all if 
And we can use them also as a safety net 
People tell me their lives ,COMMA their memories ,COMMA their aspirations ,COMMA and i create a mindscape 
I was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it 
So it's like the different layers of what we are made of .PERIOD and what we present to the world as an identity 
Why do i call it a book 
After eight years of rejection ,COMMA i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .PERIOD 
Here it's faceted glass in the bronx 
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts ,COMMA you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs ,COMMA 
It's a story about transformation and connections 
And here i've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing 
And i wanted to give them an escape 
But the result is always to have stories 
And you get to think about yourself and your memories ,COMMA and before you go back into suspension ,COMMA you edit your memories ,COMMA and you change your personality and so forth .PERIOD 
But lots of people now live to 90 or 100 ,COMMA unless they shake hands too much ,COMMA or something like that ,COMMA 
Which by chimpanzee standards is very good indeed ,COMMA 
And i guess i better skip all the rest of this ,COMMA which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and -- -- and the main idea is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that the core of a really smart machine ,COMMA is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you 
Any guesses ?QUESTIONMARK 1816 
What has changed .PERIOD our society has been wireless devices 
This is the first one .PERIOD this is an electrocardiogram 
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs .PERIOD all your vital signs :COLON your heart rhythm ,COMMA your blood pressure ,COMMA your oxygen ,COMMA your temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
If you're an expectant parent ,COMMA what about the ability to monitor ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA fetal heart rate or intrauterine contractions ,COMMA and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy and moving over into the time of delivery 
And then as we go further today ,COMMA we have continuous glucose sensors 
I didn't have one of those ,COMMA but i got the fitbit .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA how many here have any problems with sleeping 
And the wake time is in orange 
Ok ,COMMA so that's the first night 
Now ,COMMA diabetes is one of the big ones 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
One of the ones i just wanted to mention .PERIOD the ishoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling 
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute ,COMMA and that's work that started with the work that scripps with qualcomm ,COMMA 
The wireless institute ,COMMA the west wireless health institute is ,COMMA really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening gary and mary west .PERIOD and i'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this 
There's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed ,COMMA some about new aesthetics ,COMMA new approaches to food ,COMMA 
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books 
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before 
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact 
Well that first cutaway picture worked ,COMMA so we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let's do some more 
Once you start cutting things in half ,COMMA you kind of get carried away .PERIOD so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan ,COMMA 
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that's going on 
But to make them palatable ,COMMA we cut it out of a steel plate ,COMMA and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this 
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
As it comes out of the grinder ,COMMA you just have a little tray ,COMMA and you just take it off in little passes build it up ,COMMA slice it vertically ,COMMA 
Now watch closely this is popcorn .PERIOD i'll explain it here 
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics 
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative than their bold ,COMMA trephinating ancestors 
And he is credited with doing over 4000 of these public surgeries wandering around in europe ,COMMA which is an astonishing number .PERIOD when you think that surgery must have been a last resort ,COMMA 
Joseph lister was aepsis's ,COMMA or sterility's ,COMMA biggest advocate to a very ,COMMA very skeptical bunch of surgeons 
The mayo brothers came out to visit lister in europe ,COMMA 
Something so simple 
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery ,COMMA surgery with long instruments through small incisions .PERIOD 
But there were casualties of this revolution 
They had to give up their wrists 
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments 
Now ,COMMA what you put between those instruments and those hands is a large fairly complicated robot .PERIOD 
And since this was introduced in 1999 ,COMMA a lot of these robots have been out and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy ,COMMA which is a prostate deep in the pelvis ,COMMA and it requires fine dissection and delicate manipulation to be able to get a good surgical outcome .PERIOD 
More useful than a solid gold surgeon ,COMMA but still it's a fairly big capital .PERIOD investment ,COMMA 
It has to be able to come off of the centerline ,COMMA and then be able to work back toward that centerline 
It's not so simple 
For the patient ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's transparent .PERIOD this is all they're going to see 
It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this 
As we take these capabilities ,COMMA and we get to go to the next places we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be 
And i think to really get the rest of the way in that revolution ,COMMA we need to not just take our hands in in new ways .PERIOD we also need to take our eyes in in new ways .PERIOD 
We need to see beyond the surface 
You know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA the interest in contemporary forms of slavery started with a leaflet that i picked up in london 
And i'm going to admit to hubris 
It was mind-blowing 
But in fact ,COMMA that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery 
Well ,COMMA it builds up with these factors 
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world ,COMMA caused by civil wars ,COMMA ethnic conflicts ,COMMA kleptocratic governments ,COMMA disease ,COMMA you name it .PERIOD you know it 
But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law ,COMMA then if you can use violence ,COMMA if you can use violence with impunity ,COMMA you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery 
All around the world ,COMMA i've been told an almost identical story 
They said that guy looked sketchy .PERIOD i was suspicious .PERIOD but my children were hungry 
We needed medicine 
Ten miles 100 miles .PERIOD 1000 miles later ,COMMA they find themselves in dirty ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA demeaning work .PERIOD 
Africans and indians as usual south americans and eastern europeans in particular are on our buy list 
D interesting micheal bottom line .PERIOD what do you recommend 
Kevin bales ,COMMA okay ,COMMA you figured it out .PERIOD that's a spoof .PERIOD 
Slaves cost between 3000 to 8000 dollars in north america ,COMMA but i could take you places in india or nepal ,COMMA where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars .PERIOD 
They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like styrofoam cups 
You buy them cheaply ,COMMA you use them ,COMMA you crumple them up ,COMMA and then when you're done with them ,COMMA you just throw them away .PERIOD 
I've got to say ,COMMA one of the most exciting parts about my job is that i get to .PERIOD and i want to introduce you to one of those 
This is not james .PERIOD this is one of the kids that he works with 
And it can be done 
Liberation and more importantly ,COMMA all the work that comes after liberation 
This is what liberation really looks like 
She said ,COMMA no ,COMMA because we've got hope .PERIOD now 
Okay .PERIOD thank you so much .PERIOD 
Despite the new york times' and vanity ,COMMA fair's best efforts recently ,COMMA they're not brothers 
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had 
There is a picture of charles ?QUESTIONMARK so let's watch the next clip ,COMMA 
But people live on this land 
So ,COMMA what we're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture 
And i'm really here to talk about design 
And this is a little film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair 
Because it just kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA doesn't get any more basic than that 
This is a relatively famous chair 
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process ,COMMA which was incredibly important to them .PERIOD 
I'm trying to show you too much ,COMMA because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images 
This is a house that charles and ray designed 
My sister is chasing someone else .PERIOD it's not me 
Although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary ,COMMA it's not me 
The house is 1949 
And now i'm going to test you 
I hope you had a nice time at buddy's party .PERIOD 
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world 
And then embassy row is actually a historical site because in the kymaerican story .PERIOD this is where the parisian diaspora started .PERIOD where there embassy was 
And the town has really embraced it 
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of kymaerica 
And this is cranbrook .PERIOD i've got a real treat for you ,COMMA which is the first film that charles ever made 
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition 
You want to learn how to make films go make a movie 
So my point is that this scope of vision ,COMMA this holistic vision of design ,COMMA was with them from the beginning .PERIOD 
It wasn't like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we made some chairs and got successful 
So we're going to do the last clip 
And part of why this stuff is important ,COMMA and all the things that we do are important is that these are the ideas we need 
And working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer ,COMMA i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object ,COMMA which i'd bought for just 349 pounds ,COMMA there were 400 different bits made out of a hundred-plus different materials .PERIOD 
Can i come up and get some iron 
But after some nagging ,COMMA i got him to do that 
But instead of a bellows ,COMMA i had a leaf blower 
Plastic is the defining feature of cheap electrical goods 
And you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants ,COMMA but also from starches ,COMMA 
So this is attempting to make potato starch .PERIOD plastic ,COMMA 
And it was looking good for a while ,COMMA but i left it outside ,COMMA because you had to leave it outside to dry .PERIOD and unfortunately ,COMMA i came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato 
So kind of out of desperation ,COMMA i decided that i could think laterally 
And there it is on the shelves 
I don't know if you could see ,COMMA but i was never able to make insulation for the wires .PERIOD 
They were trying to catch fish 
However ,COMMA the report focused on what had already occurred and offered no information on what to expect .PERIOD now 
Voice 1 ,COMMA it's coming again .PERIOD voice 2 new wave 
You know ,COMMA if you think about something like google ,COMMA which essentially is relying on the collective intelligence of the web to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information -- we know that google does an exceptionally good job of doing that .PERIOD and it does that ,COMMA because collectively ,COMMA this disorganized thing we call the world wide web .PERIOD actually ,COMMA has a remarkable order or a remarkable intelligence in it 
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective ,COMMA distributive intelligence that is out there ,COMMA and that we know is available to us .PERIOD if we can just figure out a way of accessing it 
A network is not just the product of its component ,COMMA parts 
It is something more than that ,COMMA 
And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere ,COMMA particularly of the political blogosphere ,COMMA and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful ,COMMA decentralized ,COMMA bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions .PERIOD 
When we talk about bottom-up ,COMMA decentralized phenomena .PERIOD the ant colony is the classic metaphor ,COMMA because no individual ant knows what it's doing .PERIOD but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions 
But the pace of exponential growth is really what describes information technologies 
It makes a huge difference 
And moore's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing 
When that comes to an end ,COMMA we'll go to the sixth paradigm .PERIOD three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits ,COMMA 
The great depression made not a dent in this exponential progression .PERIOD 
And i was asked ,COMMA well ,COMMA aren't you nervous 
And the cost of a transistor cycle ,COMMA which is a measure of the price performance of electronics comes down about every year .PERIOD 
But that was really right on schedule ,COMMA 
Communication technologies ,COMMA 50 different ways to measure this ,COMMA the number of bits being moved around the size of the internet .PERIOD 
Some critics say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA software is stuck in the mud 
When i was a student ,COMMA it was across campus .PERIOD now it's in our pockets .PERIOD 
All the intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion 
Here is our founding meeting 
So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten from both the intellectual leaders ,COMMA the high-tech leaders ,COMMA particularly google and nasa ,COMMA 
Whole arm ,COMMA shoulder disarticulation 
Not in an envelope of a human arm ,COMMA with 21 degrees of freedom ,COMMA from your shoulder to your fingertips ,COMMA 
You think it's bad to lose one arm ,COMMA 
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom .PERIOD you don't need the ones in the last two fingers 
A couple of weeks ago ,COMMA we took it down to walter reed ,COMMA which is ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA more in the news ,COMMA these days 
It's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon rubber ,COMMA then coat it and paint it in 3d -- exact mirror image of their other limb .PERIOD 
This weighs 69 pounds .PERIOD 
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index ,COMMA finger .PERIOD 
That's about 10 percent of our global needs and 100 percent of some island nations 
It all began when two scientists ,COMMA fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .PERIOD 
They in fact are an endangered species themselves 
So fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day .PERIOD 
But this is no laughing matter .PERIOD 
That's the sort of technology that's available today that really wasn't available even a decade ago ,COMMA 
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe ,COMMA such as this elephant seal ,COMMA it's an opportunity to send data back to shore and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean .PERIOD 
For example .PERIOD the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific 
For animals that don't surface we have something called pop-up tags ,COMMA which collect data about light .PERIOD and what time the sun rises and sets 
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding 
And so they put this together ,COMMA a list of all the species where they're known to occur ,COMMA and it really seemed like a very esoteric ,COMMA scientific type of exercise 
So all of a sudden ,COMMA this labor of love for no obvious ,COMMA economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover .PERIOD how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years are likely to be resolved 
You can do this on a global scale ,COMMA but you can also do it on a regional scale ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA while a lot of the species ,COMMA we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn't always the case .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA this golden v kelp collected in alaska ,COMMA just below the low water .PERIOD mark is probably a new species 
This particular shrimp ,COMMA we've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp .PERIOD it's thought to have gone extinct .PERIOD 50 years ago -- at least it was until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of australia .PERIOD 
Now this little critter ,COMMA it's only about half a millimeter in size ,COMMA not terribly charismatic 
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island 
That means 91 percent ,COMMA even after the census still remain to be discovered 
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are 
A single drop of seawater could contain 160 different types of microbes 
The other point i'd like to make about this is that this ocean's interconnected .PERIOD 
Census scientists worked in the rain ,COMMA they worked in the cold ,COMMA they worked under water ,COMMA and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery ,COMMA the still vast unknown ,COMMA the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life .PERIOD 
So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of chile ,COMMA whether you're a stockbroker in new york city ,COMMA or whether you're a tedster living in edinburgh ,COMMA the oceans matter ,COMMA 
♫ i could show the world how to smile ♫ ♫ i could be glad all of the while .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could turn the gray skies to blue ,COMMA if i had you ♫ ♫ i could leave the old days behind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ leave all my pals i’d never mind .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could start my life all anew if i had you .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could climb the snow-capped mountains ,COMMA ♫ ♫ sail the mighty ocean wide .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could cross the burning desert ,COMMA if i had you by my side .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i could be a king ,COMMA dear ,COMMA uncrowned ,COMMA humble or poor ,COMMA rich or renowned .PERIOD ♫ ♫ there is nothing i couldn’t do if i had you .PERIOD ♫ thank you .PERIOD well ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD so much 
And there's a cause for that ,COMMA all right 
Well ,COMMA it's been around for 2500 years 
And we do something different than what we did in the past ,COMMA we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that 
If there are 15 operations ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that none of them work 
You've heard that word several times in the last four days ,COMMA and everyone's familiar with kuhnian paradigms ,COMMA 
And by the human spirit ,COMMA i don't mean anything divine .PERIOD i don't mean anything supernatural -- certainly not coming from this skeptic 
What i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than herself ,COMMA or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA perhaps we were not capable of 
There has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days ,COMMA 
So if we are to be the world's healer ,COMMA every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the united states -- becomes our patient .PERIOD 
I would like to quote one of my own household gods 
Think about it 
Rudimentary animal has a nervous system swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life 
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today ,COMMA the answer is simple .PERIOD the child wins ,COMMA easily 
When it comes to being dexterous ,COMMA it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous ,COMMA 
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics 
Now the americans in the audience will know all about cup ,COMMA stacking 
And it sounds like an easy problem 
So the old days before digital radio ,COMMA when you were tuning in your radio and you heard crrcckkk on the station you wanted to hear that was the noise 
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball into a hole several hundred yards away ,COMMA using a long metal stick our society will be willing to reward you with hundreds of millions of dollars 
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities 
But there's another source of information ,COMMA and that's effectively prior knowledge 
But you know that your senses are not perfect ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA there's some variability of where it's going to land shown by that cloud of red ,COMMA representing numbers between 05 ,COMMA and maybe 01 
That information is available in the current shot ,COMMA but there's another source of information not available on the current shot ,COMMA but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis ,COMMA and that's that the ball doesn't bounce with equal probability over the court during the match 
As we go around ,COMMA we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down ,COMMA but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is .PERIOD and then combine those in a real bayesian way 
So that really means ,COMMA i have to make predictions of the future 
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external 
So as i go around the world ,COMMA i'm making predictions of what i should get ,COMMA subtracting them off 
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay ,COMMA 
And based on this illustration ,COMMA we really convinced ourselves in the field that the brain's making precise predictions and subtracting them off from the sensations .PERIOD 
So we were looking for a much more objective way to assess this phenomena .PERIOD 
So if they retaliate with the same force ,COMMA the first person will think it's been escalated 
Now we don't work with children .PERIOD we don't work with hitting .PERIOD but the concept is identical 
We started with a motor with a little lever :COLON a little force transfuser 
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions and fundamentally changes the precepts 
But we've got a problem 
And there's a big gap between the task ,COMMA and the movement system 
I could choose these two paths out of an infinite number of paths 
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way 
But there's noise added to this 
So if i pick the same command through many times ,COMMA i will get a different noisy version each time because noise changes each time 
And the fundamental idea is you want to plan your movements ?QUESTIONMARK so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise 
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle 
So we've shown that using this ,COMMA we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements ,COMMA so as to minimize negative consequences of noise .PERIOD 
All the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me 
And so what i'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys .PERIOD 
They put smart skylights through their stores ,COMMA so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands 
So let me tell you this when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions ,COMMA that's going to be a very big deal .PERIOD but i'm afraid it's not enough .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA bob said ,COMMA the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in sacramento ,COMMA california that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in california 
Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from 
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what's happened in brazil is they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol 
So a team of berkeley ,COMMA researchers with 15 million dollars from the gates foundation is engineering designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient called artemisinin ,COMMA and they're going to make that drug .PERIOD 10 times cheaper 
Well ,COMMA i'll tell you -- a lot 
Second fact ,COMMA the president's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total 
Third fact ,COMMA i bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply america's energy needs for the next thousand years ,COMMA and the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of r&ampd in geothermal energy ,COMMA 
Not enough to stabilize the climate 
Not enough to keep the ice ,COMMA in greenland from crashing into the ocean 
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome ,COMMA the profitable outcome ,COMMA and therefore the likely outcome 
It is the mother of all markets .PERIOD you remember that internet 
She's like ,COMMA oh us ,COMMA i'm like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA all right .PERIOD that's cool .PERIOD 
And there's a dude selling these aftermarket weapons for lego because lego -- the danish -- no ,COMMA they're not into guns .PERIOD 
But the americans ,COMMA oh ,COMMA we'll make some guns for lego .PERIOD no problem 
And at a certain point you look around ,COMMA you're like .PERIOD whoa .PERIOD this is a really nerdy crowd 
I'm kind of into this stuff ,COMMA and i'm going to stop being embarrassed 
And so this is like this cad program where you build it 
I have to take a moment 
There's a whole gray market for lego ,COMMA thousands of home-based businesses 
Let's see here 
That's 300 million years per minute .PERIOD 
So this is frozen water .PERIOD 
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement ,COMMA in my opinion ,COMMA we've obtained of mars was released earlier this year in the magazine ,COMMA science 
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas ,COMMA methane ,COMMA ch4 ,COMMA in the atmosphere of mars ,COMMA 
That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin 
And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites 
Here's hellas basin .PERIOD a very ,COMMA very different place ,COMMA geologically 
We addressed on the board ,COMMA the major questions that have not been answered 
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane ,COMMA we call ares 
And our goal is to inspire the american public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars 
How do we transport an airplane to mars 
And we have it in something called an aeroshell 
Because we have tested ares model .PERIOD several models .PERIOD in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center ,COMMA for eight years ,COMMA under mars conditions ,COMMA 
We're ready to go 
This is the ares team .PERIOD we have about 150 scientists engineers where we're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard .PERIOD space flight center ames .PERIOD research center .PERIOD and half ,COMMA a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
And my colleague ,COMMA james fowler ,COMMA and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled .PERIOD and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate ,COMMA how they affect our lives 
They actually diffuse through networks 
You could have friendship relationships .PERIOD sibling relationships ,COMMA spousal relationships ,COMMA co-worker relationships ,COMMA neighbor relationships .PERIOD and the like ,COMMA 
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers ,COMMA or by their neighbors ,COMMA 
Nicholas christakis b ,COMMA it's obvious 
And what we show here is -- like here -- very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here .PERIOD and here's the peak of the epidemic 
And if they nominate the party host as their friend ,COMMA that party host has a hundred friends ,COMMA therefore has more friends than they do 
So we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks ,COMMA 
And also ,COMMA we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week 
By monitoring the friends group we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .PERIOD 
Now in our case ,COMMA although it wasn't necessary ,COMMA we could also actually map the network of the students 
We're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days ,COMMA 
Every dot is a person .PERIOD and every line represents a volume of calls between the people 
And in fact ,COMMA we are in the era of what i would call massive-passive data collection efforts .PERIOD 
They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population ,COMMA understand what's happening in the population and intervene in the population for the better 
One is quasi-active ,COMMA like the flu example ,COMMA i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends -- do they have the flu or not -- and then get warning 
They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution .PERIOD 
They were gone in an instant 
The royal tombs had been destroyed by suspected arson ,COMMA 
Let me leave you with a final thought ,COMMA 
And that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado ,COMMA met with a group of journalists 
It will refer you directly to your congressperson ,COMMA to your us senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court ,COMMA which the bush administration doesn't like 
He moved with the headlines 
But uh-oh ,COMMA the killers are within the camps 
Well ,COMMA if you denounce ,COMMA you're probably never going to get back in the room 
You're un-owned 
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers ,COMMA he would charge up to people who were violating international law ,COMMA and he would say you're violating ,COMMA this is the un charter 
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room 
There's going to be a lot of people 
But it never struck me as it did that moment ,COMMA because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby ,COMMA and she had no milk to nurse 
A hundred years ago ,COMMA we didn't 
At our time in history ,COMMA these images are out of place 
This is more than hiv/aids malaria and tuberculosis combined .PERIOD 
And here you see a brain scan of two children -- one who had adequate nutrition ,COMMA another ,COMMA neglected and who was deeply malnourished ,COMMA 
And so today we focus on not just passing out food ,COMMA but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment ,COMMA and teaching them about breastfeeding ,COMMA 
It doesn't need to be refrigerated .PERIOD it doesn't need water ,COMMA which is often lacking 
Eighty percent of the people in the world have no food safety net 
And usually the institutions -- churches ,COMMA temples ,COMMA other things -- do not have the resources to provide a safety net 
And if you fill the cup with local agriculture from small farmers ,COMMA you have a transformative effect .PERIOD 
Many kids in the world can't go to school ,COMMA because they have to go beg and find a meal 
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life 
Families need the help 
So is this a hopeless cause 
Cameroon ,COMMA northern cameroon ,COMMA boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .PERIOD 
Food aid coming in every year ,COMMA when people are starving during the lean seasons ,COMMA 
You manage the village manages these warehouses 
And the food banks are growing 
We're seeing that now in the horn of africa ,COMMA where food prices are up ,COMMA 240 percent in some areas over last year .PERIOD 
The shopkeepers are hiring more people 
And they require that a third of that food ,COMMA come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity 
I've gone out there ,COMMA i've met with the small farmers who have built their livelihoods on the opportunity and platform provided by this 
You look at the cost-benefit analysis ,COMMA and my dream is to take this issue ,COMMA not just from the compassion argument ,COMMA but to the finance ministers of the world and say we cannot afford to not invest in the access to adequate ,COMMA affordable nutrition for all of humanity .PERIOD 
When a leader says not under my watch ,COMMA everything begins to change 
Wfp's been able to leave 30 nations because they have transformed the face of hunger in their nations .PERIOD 
Not only that ,COMMA transforming hunger is an opportunity ,COMMA but i think we have to change our mindsets 
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years ,COMMA the government has spent 400 million dollars ,COMMA and they've allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome ,COMMA atlas project .PERIOD 
The cancer genome atlas is coming out .PERIOD now 
There's also a field of proteomics that i'll talk about in a few minutes ,COMMA which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .PERIOD 
Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment .PERIOD 
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer ,COMMA 
You know ,COMMA if i measured your temperature over 30 days ,COMMA and i asked ,COMMA what was the average temperature 
I mean ,COMMA this is a scary slide ,COMMA not to take an aside ,COMMA but it looks at obesity in the world .PERIOD 
So our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago ,COMMA 
That is the most effective ,COMMA cost-effective ,COMMA best way .PERIOD we can do things today .PERIOD 
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time ,COMMA but also your breathing ,COMMA your heart rate -- which i just also did -- and your brainwaves ,COMMA 
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute 
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound 
You all recognize that one .PERIOD this is the most-played tune in the world today 
Why are we doing this 
The first is it's essential for us to understand the human brain ,COMMA if we do want to get along in society ,COMMA and i think that it is a key step in evolution 
And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep ,COMMA or by blocking your receptors ,COMMA so that you don't feel pain ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA most anesthetics don't work that way .PERIOD 
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes 
They are highly reactive ,COMMA and they are super-plastic ,COMMA and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony ,COMMA which is unthinkable for us 
They choose very carefully who they connect with 
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons ,COMMA built digital models of all the different types of neurons .PERIOD we came across 
And we think this is species-specific ,COMMA which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species 
So let's switch it on ,COMMA but to do it ,COMMA what you have to do ,COMMA is you have to make this come alive .PERIOD 
There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex 
Here we activate it ,COMMA and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain .PERIOD when there is a stimulation .PERIOD 
We can ask ,COMMA where is it inside if we stimulate it with a picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
Fifty years ago ,COMMA when i began exploring the ocean ,COMMA no one -- not jacques ,COMMA perrin ,COMMA not jacques cousteau ,COMMA or rachel carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it ,COMMA or by what we took out of it ,COMMA 
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters that in 50 years ,COMMA we've lost -- actually ,COMMA we've taken ,COMMA we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ,COMMA why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ,COMMA why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying .PERIOD but it really should concern you 
I'm haunted by the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow's child ,COMMA asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time 
For me as a scientist ,COMMA it all began in 1953 .PERIOD when i first tried scuba 
Since then ,COMMA i've used about ,COMMA 30 kinds of submarines ,COMMA and i've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search to design and build systems to access the deep sea 
And i'm living proof 
No matter where on earth you live 
Over time ,COMMA most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there ,COMMA mostly by microbes 
You did a great job with the land ,COMMA the dirt 
We need new deep-diving submarines 
That's bad news for us ,COMMA too ,COMMA 
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea ,COMMA 
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets ,COMMA gear that continues to kill 
We're still killing bluefin tuna ,COMMA truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead 
Using google earth ,COMMA you can witness trawlers -- in china ,COMMA the north sea ,COMMA the gulf of mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system ,COMMA leaving plumes of death in their path .PERIOD 
Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA many of you are probably saying ,COMMA wait a sec .PERIOD is this tough to do 
You'll be in a massive headwind .PERIOD 
Virtually none all of our equipment ,COMMA including film equipment was charged ,COMMA by the sun ,COMMA 
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture .PERIOD that's the 130-foot diameter library ,COMMA that is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship 
Two days later ,COMMA the space traveler's manifesto explaining why -- just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space trips to satellites of the outer planets .PERIOD august 20 1958 
And that's why when you get something declassified ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
This is ed day putting so each of these coffee cans has three pounds of c4 in it 
So thanks to him .PERIOD 
And now we have ground hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad 
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified ,COMMA just that people managed to sneak home .PERIOD and after ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on their deathbed basically gave me 
And one part of nasa was interested in it ,COMMA but the headquarters in nasa ,COMMA they killed the project 
So finally ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965 ,COMMA and then all those paths came to a halt 
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways ,COMMA 
And to the extent you believe ,COMMA i didn't shrink the lines which i didn't .PERIOD i've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you 
Right ,COMMA it's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer 
Turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program 
When you walk into the dmv ,COMMA the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing 
What do you do do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?QUESTIONMARK 
The other group of the physicians ,COMMA they said yesterday ,COMMA when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications .PERIOD you didn't try out yet ,COMMA ibuprofen and piroxicam 
Now think of it ,COMMA this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .PERIOD 
The thing is is that no physician would ever say piroxicam .PERIOD ibuprofen :COLON hip replacement 
An online subscription for 59 dollars 
These are the market share most people wanted the combo deal .PERIOD 
The answer was absolutely .PERIOD yes ,COMMA 
Now you're getting it 
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here 
These 14 million cellular radio masts ,COMMA or base stations ,COMMA consume a lot of energy 
And that creates a big problem 
It's good for a nice suntan ,COMMA but otherwise dangerous for the human body 
And multiply that by 10000 ,COMMA then you end up at 14 billion 
Not usable for a youtube video 
And the light goes through that hole 
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream 
And not only integrate a photo detector here ,COMMA but maybe use the camera inside 
So what happens when i switch on that light ,COMMA 
But at the same time you see this video coming up here 
So no one ,COMMA if i have a light here ,COMMA if i have secure data ,COMMA no one on the other side of this room ,COMMA through that wall would be able to read that data 
So for me ,COMMA the applications of it to me ,COMMA are beyond imagination at the moment ,COMMA 
And they use light to illuminate space down there ,COMMA 
If you saw 2001 a space odyssey .PERIOD and you heard the boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom ,COMMA boom .PERIOD and you saw the monolith ,COMMA you know .PERIOD that was arthur c .PERIOD clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species ,COMMA 
And you know we in the last 30 years in particular ,COMMA have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools 
And we've seen many seminal moments 
You're walking around your car has 12 microprocessors 
Then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together ,COMMA we flatten the world 
The dna is organized in words ,COMMA call them ,COMMA genes and chromosomes .PERIOD 
Dna is a very elegant molecule 
This here is a bug in my genome that i have struggled with for a long long time ,COMMA 
What is the code 
Then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out 
For my wife ,COMMA eat three times as much ,COMMA and you never put on any weight ,COMMA 
It's all hidden in this code ,COMMA and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace 
We can understand ,COMMA for example ,COMMA why we create plaque in our arteries ,COMMA what creates the starchiness inside of a grain ,COMMA why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide .PERIOD 
We can also look at at a grander scale ,COMMA what creates problems ,COMMA what creates disease and how we may be able to fix them 
Now ,COMMA you have the genome and you say to yourself ,COMMA so if i plug this synthetic genome -- if i pull the old one out and plug it in -- does it just boot up and live 
And this is extremely profound 
So then what do you do 
We can start to figure that out 
And he had the best answer i ever heard to this question .PERIOD well ,COMMA somebody has to 
You cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog's brain 
Go on something should happen .PERIOD now 
No ,COMMA we go puppy ,COMMA sit -- boom ,COMMA it's got it in six to 10 trials 
He'll find jamie wherever he is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA wherever kids are crushing rocks by a stream ,COMMA or something and take him a little message that says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA dinner's ready come in for dinner .PERIOD 
So at this point ,COMMA the dog knows what we want it to do 
The dog lives with you ,COMMA the dog can get you any time 
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do .PERIOD and this is very easy .PERIOD 
And what we're doing in essence ,COMMA is we're teaching the dog kind of like -- we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us 
And now the dog's really happy 
There's several definitions of what a punishment is ,COMMA but one definition ,COMMA the most popular is ,COMMA a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior ,COMMA such that it's less likely to occur in the future 
The dog is actually euthanized now ,COMMA but this was a dog i worked with for a while ,COMMA 
When the dog would try to leave the mat ,COMMA she would say ,COMMA rover on the mat ,COMMA on the mat ,COMMA on the mat .PERIOD 
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear 
Rover come here ,COMMA rover ,COMMA come here ,COMMA you son of a bitch 
And i went ,COMMA oh my god do i do something 
The husband won't clear up his clothes ,COMMA or the wife's always late for meetings ,COMMA whatever it is .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
You see it ,COMMA especially in the workplace ,COMMA especially from boss to employee 
And this i would say is the biggest human foible that we have 
Your kids are easy to train 
We think how we do it -- one night in bed ,COMMA we're pregnant ,COMMA and then we're raising the most important thing in life .PERIOD a child 
And it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality .PERIOD 
I call it sort of shotgun flexibility 
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building 
So that was the core idea 
So once we had presented that back to them ,COMMA they agreed that this sort of core concept could work 
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram ,COMMA those are the boxes 
That skin serves double duty .PERIOD again for economics .PERIOD 
So it's an unusual building for a public library .PERIOD obviously 
That was the main sort of technology area in the building ,COMMA 
You dizzy yet 
And it allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower ,COMMA acoustic enclosure ,COMMA light enclosure and so forth .PERIOD 
They came to us ,COMMA and they said -- unlike normal ,COMMA developers -- they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville .PERIOD that's our main goal .PERIOD 
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money ,COMMA they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown .PERIOD 
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art .PERIOD but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate ,COMMA interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within 
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building .PERIOD 
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool ,COMMA they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool ,COMMA so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery .PERIOD space 
Ok ,COMMA now you're 19 now 
And i tried ,COMMA and i made it 
And you made it out of what 
And so ,COMMA and that windmill ,COMMA what -- it worked 
Yeah ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what did they make of -- that you were 14 ?QUESTIONMARK 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ?QUESTIONMARK they were impressed 
Yeah ,COMMA 
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village 
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms .PERIOD 
♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop ♫ ♫ this is a loop ,COMMA feedback loop .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this is a -- all right ,COMMA i don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate -- -- but my point is ,COMMA it's the sound of self-destruction 
There seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from it gets ugly ,COMMA 
The oil was running out ,COMMA and a nuclear winter would finish us off 
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand .PERIOD 
Homo erectus made the same tool for 30000 generations .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA there were a few changes ,COMMA but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days ,COMMA 
It's an extraordinary phenomenon ,COMMA but it's true 
And more than that ,COMMA it's a confection of different ideas ,COMMA the idea of plastic ,COMMA the idea of a laser ,COMMA the idea of transistors ,COMMA 
One goes extinct for the other to survive .PERIOD 
So what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species 
So oz is better at both spears and axes than adam 
Ask yourself ,COMMA how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light .PERIOD this evening to read a book by 
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity ,COMMA that you've gained since 1950 as it were ,COMMA because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else ,COMMA or you can acquire another good or service 
They were a highly intelligent species 
The reason because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight ,COMMA and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10000 years ,COMMA 
The tasmanians were isolated 
It's not the same with language 
With language ,COMMA we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other 
There will be wars .PERIOD there will be depressions .PERIOD there will be natural disasters .PERIOD 
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously ,COMMA on a collective level 
And as individuals ,COMMA we all do these things all the time everyday 
It's like when you're mean to your wife ,COMMA because you're mad at somebody else ,COMMA 
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt ,COMMA or whatever ,COMMA 
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption .PERIOD 
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life ,COMMA that's the size it would be 
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of americans who die from cigarette smoking .PERIOD 
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it 
And strangely enough ,COMMA the only plastic surgery that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction .PERIOD and most of that is being done by men 
My belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad to look at these issues 
How can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine 
But evolution is a balance where you have fast change ,COMMA you also have ultra-conservation -- things that almost never change 
And so we looked into this a little more carefully ,COMMA and i'm going to show you data now ,COMMA 
Down here ,COMMA you can see slower evolution ,COMMA less diversity 
Ok ,COMMA so ,COMMA that's what we did .PERIOD but how are we going to do that 
If you've got enough money to buy just a camry ,COMMA you can build one of these too ,COMMA and so we put a deep how-to guide on the web ,COMMA totally free ,COMMA with basically order-off-the-shelf parts 
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project -- we just started by making a respiratory virus chip 
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere -- it's like boogeremia ,COMMA basically ,COMMA 
And so it is not any one stripe or something that tells me i have a virus of a particular type here .PERIOD it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing .PERIOD 
That's me ,COMMA getting a nasal lavage .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses .PERIOD even when you're walking around healthy 
So that's great .PERIOD but again ,COMMA cheap shot ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we built out the chip 
Now we're using this chip ,COMMA and what are we using it for 
And this is what this looks like 
And that is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA what these particular cell cultures are chronically infected with 
So let's do something a little bit harder .PERIOD 
They did a ct scan 
Switch antibiotics ,COMMA so they switched to another antibiotic tamiflu ,COMMA 
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it 
And why is that just lore ,COMMA there's no data -- no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease .PERIOD 
It doesn't make sense -- unless maybe there's a virus 
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses 
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses .PERIOD 
This was all done by folks in the lab -- i cannot take credit for most of this 
I'm talking about the production of aluminum 
The electrolyte is not a solution of salt and water ,COMMA but rather salt that's melted 
So now how to choose the metals 
I felt the thrill of realization when i knew i'd come upon the answer 
It's pretty cool at least in theory 
We go to the laboratory 
No ,COMMA i hire a student and mentor him teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective ,COMMA and then turn him loose .PERIOD 
And i was able to attract really really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society ,COMMA not science and service for career building 
I went to aspen recently and stumbled into this song 
♫ black men go to aspen .PERIOD ♫ ♫ and rent colorful chalets .PERIOD ♫ ♫ giggle at the questions ♫ ♫ their mere presence seems to raise ♫ ♫ get taken for men ♫ ♫ we don't resemble in the least .PERIOD ♫ are you 
And since they discovered those things it really stuck with them so much more ,COMMA and also they would experience their own failures .PERIOD there was a failure-based aspect to learning there .PERIOD it was very important 
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago ,COMMA was powers of ten ,COMMA charles and ray eames' film .PERIOD 
And so i'm going to show you a toy today that i've been working on that i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy 
Now we actually play through many generations here ,COMMA at the cellular scale .PERIOD 
But basically ,COMMA this is the editor where we're going to design the next generation of our creature .PERIOD so it has a little spine 
But really the goal here was within about a minute ,COMMA i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create 
Ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA i'll put some hands on it 
And i can see how it might dance 
I can also play with the dynamics of this world ,COMMA over time ,COMMA 
And our cities are going to be at risk too ,COMMA because a lot of these are coastal cities 
Here it is some indigenous life down here .PERIOD 
You see now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics 
I think i'll leave before they get hostile 
But these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here ,COMMA 
Because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking ,COMMA and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 100 ,COMMA or 1000 years out 
And so i'm going to talk a little bit about that ,COMMA keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here 
What's in it for the ant 
No ,COMMA it's worse than that ,COMMA 
There are a lot of ideas to die for 
The secret of happiness is find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it 
Actually ,COMMA i think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas ,COMMA but for their likely misuses 
So let me just point out memes are like viruses 
And you might think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how can that be 
They're made of information and can be carried in any physical medium 
Not just the priests ,COMMA everybody 
After all the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite 
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world ,COMMA thanks to our technology are a lot of toxic ideas 
And it's not our fault anymore than it's our fault .PERIOD when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity 
We drove to the goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously ,COMMA my idea being that i would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again .PERIOD 
I tell that story ,COMMA because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this earth ,COMMA 
It's thrilling 
First she talked about comfort status ,COMMA beauty 
And we've started making curtains ,COMMA and not only is it beautiful ,COMMA but people can see status -- that you care about your children 
Thank you 
My job depends upon it 
Up to and around about the second world war ,COMMA conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse ,COMMA not just the orchestra as a whole ,COMMA but individuals ,COMMA within it within an inch of their lives ,COMMA 
Let's be under no illusions .PERIOD 
Simply through singing 
So we got some shows off the ground .PERIOD we started touring them internationally 
One of them was carmen 
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about south african music making 
They don't read music 
And yet ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA every single one of us on this planet probably engages with music on a daily basis .PERIOD 
I've got a little experiment i want to try with you 
T ,COMMA see ,COMMA it's the same as f in music .PERIOD 
There i am like a bloody windmill .PERIOD again .PERIOD you see 
The music will start .PERIOD and then at a signal from me ,COMMA you will sing that 
One more time with feeling ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA 
It's going to be britain's first ever national disabled orchestra ,COMMA 
Clarence i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk 
I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today ,COMMA so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary .PERIOD they are 
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point please ?QUESTIONMARK let me know 
Haydn remonstrated with the prince ,COMMA but to no avail .PERIOD 
♫ like the heather ♫ ♫ on the hillside ♫ ♫ as they drove us ♫ ♫ from the highlands ♫ ♫ like the ice flow ♫ ♫ from the arctic ♫ ♫ where we landed ♫ ♫ in newfoundland ♫ ♫ there's a color ♫ ♫ to my sorrow ♫ ♫ there's a name for ♫ ♫ all this sadness ♫ ♫ like the ocean ♫ ♫ in between us ♫ ♫ i am blue .PERIOD ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ so i came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ and i dazzled ♫ ♫ in these dark streets ♫ ♫ like a diamond ♫ ♫ in a coalface ♫ ♫ then the cold wind ♫ ♫ from the islands ♫ ♫ blew a storm cloud ♫ ♫ across the new moon ♫ ♫ like the gun smoke ♫ ♫ above the houses ♫ ♫ in my home ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ well the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of a man who left to his three sons ,COMMA 17 camels ,COMMA 
Seventeen doesn't divide by two 
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time .PERIOD and finally ,COMMA she came back and said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i don't know if i can help you ,COMMA but at least ,COMMA if you want ,COMMA you can have my camel 
They had one camel left over 
Now ,COMMA if you think about that story for a moment ,COMMA i think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in 
As i've spent the last better part of three decades ,COMMA almost four traveling the world ,COMMA trying to work ,COMMA getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela .PERIOD some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet .PERIOD i've been asking myself that question 
So ,COMMA how do they deal with their differences 
But what we don't often see is that there's always a third side .PERIOD and the third side of the conflict is us .PERIOD it's the surrounding community .PERIOD it's the friends ,COMMA the allies ,COMMA the family members .PERIOD the neighbors 
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the parties of what's really at stake 
And we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room ,COMMA where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place 
And then he went on ,COMMA and then he turned to me and said ,COMMA you're an american 
Now i don't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict ,COMMA but i think i've got a first step ,COMMA literally ,COMMA a first step something that any one of us could do as third-siders 
And so my question is ,COMMA yes ,COMMA let's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east .PERIOD but let's also take a look at the story .PERIOD 
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it ,COMMA 
What would that mean ?QUESTIONMARK what is the story there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now as anthropologists ,COMMA we know that every culture has an origin story 
That man ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was abraham 
What's the opposite of terrorism ,COMMA 
It's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend ,COMMA whom you welcome into your home .PERIOD in order to sow and create understanding ,COMMA or respect ,COMMA or love .PERIOD 
And that's what comes to the first step here ,COMMA 
That's the essence of the abraham path 
So what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people 
And just a couple weeks ago ,COMMA there was an npr story on it 
And they quoted a villager who said ,COMMA this walk connects us to the world 
She's partially blind .PERIOD her husband can't work .PERIOD she's got seven kids 
And so more and more walkers have come ,COMMA and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family .PERIOD 
So my question is ,COMMA if it can be done in europe ,COMMA why not in the middle east 
That's walking abraham's path .PERIOD 
After a tedtalk ?QUESTIONMARK why not a tedwalk 
There's an old african proverb that goes when spider webs unite ,COMMA they can halt even the lion 
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace ,COMMA we can even halt .PERIOD the lion of war 
Well ,COMMA what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack ,COMMA 
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery ,COMMA 
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk ,COMMA we could know before they even have symptoms that they're having a heart attack to save their life .PERIOD 
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin ,COMMA like you see in an emergency room ,COMMA and i'm going to show you why they don't work very well .PERIOD 
Next to it at 30 seconds ,COMMA you see this rise here ,COMMA then this rise -- that's the st elevation .PERIOD 
Then on friday at 643 ,COMMA he began to get certain signs ,COMMA which later we had the pig run around -- i'm not going to go into this early stage 
Finally ,COMMA if you're lucky ,COMMA you are treated in three or four hours after the incident ,COMMA but the heart muscle has died 
And now i want to talk about something entirely different 
So here's a picture of what we're doing 
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura ,COMMA and this visual aura ,COMMA by the way -- and i'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing .PERIOD lights ,COMMA gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field .PERIOD 
Christina sidebottom ,COMMA well ,COMMA my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like ,COMMA and it was very strange 
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times .PERIOD and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches ,COMMA not only those with aura ,COMMA get treated and get diminished 
Well ,COMMA responsive electrical stimulation means that we sense at a place in your brain ,COMMA which is called an epileptic focus ,COMMA which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there that it's going to happen .PERIOD and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot ,COMMA which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache ,COMMA 
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy ,COMMA which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon ,COMMA 
We want to have some people who really know how to do this perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches .PERIOD 
And that is the second wish 
We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it ,COMMA so that it could be used elsewhere in the world 
And so there is a team of developers from all over africa ,COMMA who are part of this team now -- from ghana ,COMMA from malawi ,COMMA from kenya ,COMMA 
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at 
So you've got a lot of information .PERIOD that's great 
Take the crowd and apply them to the information 
And we are very happy to be part of the ted family 
It's inevitable terrible ,COMMA but really what i want to talk about is .PERIOD i'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die 
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book ,COMMA a soul-searching letter 
If a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- john ,COMMA it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love .PERIOD we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes 
So ,COMMA what do i plan to leave for my son 
I plan to publish my own notebook 
I have no idea how i'm going to do it ,COMMA but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book ,COMMA and leave that published book for my son ,COMMA 
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture or an ecosystem that's been created that if you take some words from apple ,COMMA the catchphrase that we create rip mix and burn 
And what that's done is it's created like ,COMMA i said a vibrant community that's very inclusive with people continually working to connect musical ideas ,COMMA innovate them ,COMMA and keep things constantly up to date .PERIOD 
Imagine making it free ,COMMA so that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge and imagine using information technology ,COMMA so that you can update this content ,COMMA improve it play with it on a timescale that's more on the order of seconds .PERIOD instead of years ,COMMA 
In fact ,COMMA a lot of this use coming from unites states .PERIOD k-through-12 schools ,COMMA because anyone who's involved in a school scale back .PERIOD the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum .PERIOD and so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst for this kind of open free content .PERIOD 
We've been working with amd ,COMMA which has a project called 50 by '15 ,COMMA which is trying to bring internet connectivity to 50 percent of the world's population by 2015 .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA a bunch of the projects that are funded by hewlett foundation who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content ,COMMA 
Ok ,COMMA burn ,COMMA i think this is sort of quite interesting 
How much would it cost in a bookstore 
Why does it cost 22 dollars 
Remember we took the book tore the pages out 
Imagine music xml that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music ,COMMA play with it ,COMMA understand it 
Even the three wise men 
Because we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons .PERIOD anybody can contribute anything 
So thanks very much .PERIOD 
I've been at mit for 44 years ,COMMA i went to ted ,COMMA i 
Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems .PERIOD they include education ,COMMA sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education .PERIOD 
So with those as the principles -- some of you may know ,COMMA seymour papert this is back in 1982 when we were working in senegal ,COMMA 
Here we're in the '80s ,COMMA 
And these kids their first english word is google ,COMMA and they only know skype .PERIOD they've never heard of telephony 
Screw you go to the back of the line ,COMMA and someone else will do it .PERIOD and then ,COMMA when you figure out that this works ,COMMA you can join as well .PERIOD 
And the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down .PERIOD and that's why i said seven to 10 million there 
Now once people start looking at this ,COMMA they say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this is a laptop project 
Because laptop economics are the following .PERIOD i say 50 percent here .PERIOD it's more like 60 .PERIOD 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales .PERIOD marketing ,COMMA distribution and profit .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA i've been using laptops since their inception 
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight 
And in about 30 days ,COMMA we'll know for sure whether this works 
Probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance 
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with 
Everybody thinks they know about education .PERIOD a lot of culture is built into it as well .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA guess what we're not 
Because there's no market for post office trucks ,COMMA 
You can spray paint it .PERIOD you can do anything you want 
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel ,COMMA because if you think about it ,COMMA space is pretty awkward 
He said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD here's a better way .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA okay ,COMMA 
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone ,COMMA the room would be very crowded 
These are the people that you have access to right now in general -- all of these people ,COMMA all of your friends and family that you can connect to 
But when you actually visualize it all the connections that we're doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the internet -- it doesn't look technological 
It actually looks very organic 
It's that they're helping us to be more human helping us to connect with each other 
We're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other ,COMMA regardless of geography 
So that's why i study cyborg anthropology .PERIOD 
And people are initially reluctant to tell you 
We talk about things in relative terms ,COMMA 
And so ,COMMA when we look at these pmtct programs what does it mean 
Imagine yourself if you can ,COMMA you're a young woman in africa ,COMMA you're going to the hospital or clinic 
And you don't know who you can talk to ,COMMA because the truth is ,COMMA hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner your family ,COMMA anyone in your home ,COMMA you're likely to be thrown out without any means of support 
And this -- this is the face and story of hiv in africa today ,COMMA 
But we're here to talk about possible solutions ,COMMA and some good news 
Our organization ,COMMA mothers2mothers ,COMMA enlists women with hiv as care providers .PERIOD 
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life ,COMMA you'd like to engage someone someone who's had the procedure 
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts ,COMMA 
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care 
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma ,COMMA 
And if we can change enough communities ,COMMA we can change national attitudes 
We have the medicines ,COMMA we have the tests ,COMMA but how do you reduce the stigma ?QUESTIONMARK 
I've been afraid to tell everybody 
How do you build a better health care system 
And our organization helps women across that bridge ,COMMA 
The program is now working in nine countries we have 670 program sites .PERIOD we're seeing about 230000 women every month .PERIOD we're employing 1600 mentor mothers and last year ,COMMA they enrolled 300000 hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers 
All of this is possible ,COMMA if we each contribute to this fight ,COMMA 
Thank you 
Then they irradiate our food ,COMMA trying to make it last longer ,COMMA so it can travel thousands of miles from where it's grown to the supermarkets .PERIOD 
This man ,COMMA joel salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system .PERIOD 
Since i'm home-schooled ,COMMA i went to go hear him speak one day 
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets in every community popping up 
Not too long ago ,COMMA my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal 
Now we had a harvard professor here -- she was from harvard .PERIOD i just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from harvard 
The scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to 100 percent bible literally true 
Now ,COMMA let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA it needs to be small 
Now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about 900 bucks 
Free bird 
Ok ,COMMA one more time -- i'm just going to give you a little help 
And finally ,COMMA we're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top 
Mr ,COMMA vice president .PERIOD i wish i knew how to quit you 
And sylvia earle ,COMMA and i were on an expedition in this submarine 20 years ago in japan ,COMMA 
But when i got there ,COMMA i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris 
It's in the mid-pacific ,COMMA it's about five days from anywhere ,COMMA 
So that's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into 
It's a very deep-water part of our planet 
But we got up there ,COMMA and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go .PERIOD okay ,COMMA where are we going to dive 
Let's try there and then falling into the water 
The phoenix islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries ,COMMA especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here 
So i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,COMMA but they did finally come to an end 
They basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean .PERIOD 
And for some reason ,COMMA they didn't want me to come ,COMMA or it was hard to find a time and a place ,COMMA and it took a while .PERIOD but finally ,COMMA they said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA you can come 
And i was free for dinner ,COMMA and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati 
It had occurred on land in rainforests of south america and africa ,COMMA where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down 
So we had very strong leadership very good vision ,COMMA and a lot of science ,COMMA a lot of lawyers involved 
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting ,COMMA but now it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas 
And that's the story with climate-change heating 
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .PERIOD 
And i actually went to see some of the design companies in hong kong .PERIOD in my stay there .PERIOD 
And i'll just give you one example .PERIOD i had gotten my first walkman

To which he said ,COMMA let them be because what they're giving us is worth a lot more than what we're paying them 
So these 99 stones ,COMMA a few kind of rules in the game number one .PERIOD you don't choose the stone .PERIOD the stone chooses you 
Well 
We have jabbar from saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power 
I'm like are all the girls going to be kind and merciful .PERIOD and the guys all strong 
That's not timely 
And that led to all kinds of things from being in curricula in universities and schools to -- one of my favorite pictures ,COMMA i have from south asia ,COMMA it was a couple of men with long beards and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school 
Opened a theme park through a license in kuwait a year .PERIOD and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 300000 square feet ,COMMA 20 rides ,COMMA all with our characters ,COMMA a couple back-to-school licenses in spain and turkey .PERIOD

As the father of five sons ,COMMA i worry about who they're going to be using as role models 
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is ,COMMA but when it's done by your hero ,COMMA that just breaks you in so many ways 
Now one of the things that i refer to when i -- about the importance of this message -- is that i gave a lecture at the medical school at kuwait university ,COMMA where i lecture on the biological basis of behavior ,COMMA and i gave the students two articles ,COMMA one from the new york times ,COMMA and one from new york magazine ,COMMA 
Any boys and girls caught flirting would get married off immediately .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
The second one took place in upstate new york 
She was actually coming out of an amnesty international meeting ,COMMA 
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that .PERIOD and that's using our eyes more 
And it mushroomed slightly afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to 3000 billion 
So there it is 227 billion is what africa owes 
And the recent financial crisis ,COMMA how much of this diagram might that figure take up 
We need to imagine what a landscape of the world's fears might look like ,COMMA 
This is mountains out of molehills ,COMMA a timeline of global media .PERIOD panic 
And there's a very interesting .PERIOD and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it 
Let me show you this 
I'll take answers 
I wonder if i could make my life beautiful 
It's the language of the eye 
But of course ,COMMA china has an enormous population .PERIOD 
And if it can do that ,COMMA maybe it can also change your behavior 
But what it points to is that visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression 
So heart is filtered out .PERIOD so i can see ,COMMA if i'm curious about that 
So the data is now alive .PERIOD this is a living image ,COMMA and i can update it in a second 
It's even fun to engage with them ,COMMA because it's visual 
And that is beautiful .PERIOD thank you 
I will show it to you 
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning ,COMMA the cut-grass green ,COMMA what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms -- and this would be called a green note ,COMMA because it smells of something green ,COMMA like cut grass ,COMMA 
This is cis-3-hexene-1-ol ,COMMA and i had to learn chemistry on the fly .PERIOD in the last three years ,COMMA a very expensive high school chemistry .PERIOD education 
Now ,COMMA this is a totally insane idea .PERIOD 
And my definition of a theory is ,COMMA it’s not just something that you teach people .PERIOD it’s labor saving 
If it does you put the glass down ,COMMA you go to a different bar 
Now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology .PERIOD and he says ,COMMA that’s easy .PERIOD the things are a different color 
Now fact ,COMMA b ,COMMA nothing in the world has that frequency ,COMMA except s-h ,COMMA 
And in an enormous 40-page paper in german ,COMMA he says ,COMMA at one point -- my wife is german ,COMMA and she translated it for me -- and at one point he says ,COMMA ganz widerlich geruch ,COMMA an absolutely repulsive smell ,COMMA which is good ,COMMA reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide 
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose ,COMMA you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this 
Ok ,COMMA now ,COMMA if something absorbs the energy ,COMMA the electron can travel 
What’s nice about this idea ,COMMA if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose ,COMMA the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses 
He says to me ,COMMA i bet you cannot make a coumarin 
Now ,COMMA coumarin is a very common thing .PERIOD a material in fragrance ,COMMA which is derived from a bean that comes from south america 
And you’re completely wrong ,COMMA and i’m sure you’re completely wrong 
Working with the harvard business school ,COMMA you'll see this example .PERIOD when you talk about minimum payment ,COMMA if you spent 62 dollars for a meal ,COMMA the longer you take to pay out that loan .PERIOD you see over a period of time ,COMMA using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents 
But it's going to work ,COMMA it's more effective than just computational aids 
Received very favorably by business 
And there is some good news to report today 
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible .PERIOD 
Now we come down to it ,COMMA relatives grieving 
Never retreat to the 'glorious past' keep to the track ,COMMA to the beaten track .PERIOD treat every day of your life as your last

Lady lady ,COMMA do not weep -- what is gone is gone .PERIOD now sleep 
What of the titans of media

At 30 ,COMMA my powers seemed mighty to me 
Grown sick to our stomachs and sick of our lives ,COMMA 
Um ,COMMA there are -- i've got far too much money .PERIOD and i have far too much fun in my businesses ,COMMA 
I was in a clinic ,COMMA i wasn't allowed to make telephone calls 
That was in october of 2000 
But sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man's position 
But sometimes i try to put myself in that position ,COMMA 
But it's interesting to me .PERIOD i love to write historical verse 
I love to think what they thought what it was like 
We're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room ,COMMA 
And you stay up for 12 
But always we scrabbled to lie with her first 
We are one species of about five and a half .PERIOD thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today ,COMMA 
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface ,COMMA 
In fact ,COMMA if you go back in time ,COMMA it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time 
And i imagined him to be tall ,COMMA dark-skinned 
We began to find limb bones .PERIOD we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis ,COMMA vertebrae ,COMMA ribs ,COMMA the collar bones ,COMMA things that had never ever been seen before ,COMMA in homo erectus ,COMMA 
But also surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia ,COMMA where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated ,COMMA and have become dwarfed ,COMMA and they're only about a meter in height .PERIOD 
And what is it that really makes us us 
I think it's our collective intelligence 
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder -- it's a repository for my brain ,COMMA everything that i could possibly be interested in 
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand .PERIOD i made some measurements of her thumb ,COMMA and i scaled them out to the size of the skull ,COMMA 
Built out of words ,COMMA it is the engine that drives the plot of his book .PERIOD and also the movie in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett created out of words ,COMMA inspired by the kniphausen hawk .PERIOD and this represents the falcon in the movie 
And so now it was time to do some research 
What do they do ?QUESTIONMARK how do you start something like that ?QUESTIONMARK i really don't know 
And i'm following all the light kicks on this thing ,COMMA and making sure that as i'm holding the light in the same position ,COMMA i'm getting the same type of reflection on it -- that's the level of detail .PERIOD i'm going into this thing 
This thing was made of resin ,COMMA and it was too light 
That's half the weight of my dog huxley ,COMMA 
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica i bought on ebay 
So what do i do ?QUESTIONMARK i figure i have two options 
One i can fire a freaking laser at it ,COMMA which i have already done to do a 3d scan -- there's a 3d scan of this falcon ,COMMA 
But really ,COMMA if we're all going to be honest with ourselves ,COMMA i have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with was it 
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2000 feet ,COMMA 
If i go out in the open ocean environment ,COMMA virtually anywhere in the world ,COMMA and i drag a net from 3000 feet to the surface ,COMMA most of the animals -- in fact ,COMMA in many places 80 to 90 percent of the animals that i bring up in that net -- make light 
So you turn on the camera turn out the lights 
I knew my forward speed ,COMMA i knew the area and so i could figure out how many hundreds of sources there were per cubic meter 
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen 
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure 
So she's got a lure that she sticks out in front of this living mousetrap of needle-sharp teeth in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey 
So now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world ,COMMA because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this is a deep-sea version of women's lib .PERIOD 
She always knows where he is ,COMMA and she doesn't have to be monogamous ,COMMA because some of these females come up with multiple males attached 
And we were using a special trawling net that we were able to bring these animals up alive 
This is an unbelievable light show 
So i've wanted for a long time to figure out a different way to explore 
That's me on the left ,COMMA my graduate student at the time erika raymond .PERIOD and lee ,COMMA fry ,COMMA who was the engineer on the project 
We're at the edge of the brine pool .PERIOD there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera 
Dna design nature art .PERIOD these are the three things that condition my world 
All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand .PERIOD but anyway -- this is a meringue .PERIOD this is another sample .PERIOD i have 
It shows how you make one holistic form ,COMMA like the car industry ,COMMA and then you break up what you need 
It's like 21st-century henry moore ,COMMA when you see a henry moore ,COMMA still ,COMMA your hair stands up .PERIOD there's some amazing spiritual .PERIOD connect 
We need to be in that realm ,COMMA i want to do stuff like that 
This is two weeks ago in ccp in coventry ,COMMA who build parts for bentleys ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
This is what goes on in my studio everyday .PERIOD i walk -- i'm traveling .PERIOD i come back 
I said ,COMMA you get into biopolymers .PERIOD they looked straight through me 
I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years sitting on a hot bed ,COMMA 
You see that thing you do 
I'm not putting charles eames' furniture in buildings anymore .PERIOD 
Who cares 
This is called a plasnet 
These are my sculptures 
This is a room of sleep-deprived women 
And in the course of that ,COMMA i studied ,COMMA i met with medical doctors scientists .PERIOD and i'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive ,COMMA more inspired more joyful life is getting enough sleep .PERIOD 
And our guide was a local science teacher 
At the end of this day ,COMMA i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher ,COMMA 
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem .PERIOD and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference .PERIOD 
The trial lawyers say ,COMMA well ,COMMA this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine .PERIOD 
The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur ,COMMA because doctors are afraid to speak up ,COMMA are you sure that's the right dosage ?QUESTIONMARK 
It goes on ,COMMA we did a study of all the rules that affect one school in new york .PERIOD the board of ed had no idea 
I mean ,COMMA it's just absolutely a formula for failure .PERIOD 
And why not they don't trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK why don't they trust the law ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA how do you fix it ,COMMA we could spend 10000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .PERIOD 
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties ,COMMA because it carries with it ,COMMA the power of state 
If you make people self-conscious about their judgments ,COMMA studies show you will make them make worse judgments .PERIOD 
Edison stated it best .PERIOD he said ,COMMA hell ,COMMA we ain't got no rules around here .PERIOD we're trying to accomplish something 
All these choices involve value judgments and social norms .PERIOD not objective facts 
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator .PERIOD 
So what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy 
Law is a human institution .PERIOD responsibility is a human institution 
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims .PERIOD then all of us go through the day ,COMMA looking over our shoulders 
What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .PERIOD 
The second thing i want to do is introduce my co-author and dear friend and co-teacher 
We certainly can't trust the bankers ,COMMA and we certainly can't trust the brokers 
And even as we do our own work ,COMMA all too often ,COMMA we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing ,COMMA or the required thing ,COMMA or the profitable thing 
Or if they do have our interests at heart ,COMMA we worry that they don't know us .PERIOD well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to secure those interests 
In addition ,COMMA we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long-term interests even of their own companies .PERIOD rather than securing short-term profits ,COMMA 
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse .PERIOD it is that 
A wise person knows when to bend the rules ,COMMA 
A wise person knows when to improvise 
And most important ,COMMA a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending in the service of the right aims 
He was supporting his wife and a child .PERIOD and the child was going to parochial school 
Then he lost his job 
The judge on the case judge lois forer thought that this made no sense 
He did ,COMMA he served out his sentence 
For ms .PERIOD dewey ?QUESTIONMARK this isn't why she became a teacher 
In the veterans' court -- this was the first of its kind in the united states 
Why has the idea spread 
Anyone would glom onto a criminal justice system that has this kind of a record 
So here's is a system-changer ,COMMA and it seems to be catching 
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness ,COMMA and he was right 
Indeed ,COMMA we argue there is no substitute for wisdom .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA we started off the nuclear age in 1945 
We had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima .PERIOD a few days later in nagasaki in august 1945 ,COMMA killing about 250000 people between those two 
So the goal was to evacuate the target cities 
We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .PERIOD 
This disconnect was never actually resolved 
So what is a nuclear terror threat 
There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it 
Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives .PERIOD in order to do a lot of damage to us ,COMMA it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work 
You take it wherever you want to take it ,COMMA and you can detonate it 
You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability .PERIOD but what i'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening 
I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time .PERIOD soon ,COMMA although even that is not completely off the table 
There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth ,COMMA many ,COMMA many times over 
We're coming down ,COMMA and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district ,COMMA 
This is a 10-kiloton bomb ,COMMA slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima .PERIOD and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information .PERIOD i think -- news you could use kind of concept here 
And if you're in this vicinity ,COMMA you've got to get away 
And if you're wearing clothing ,COMMA you've taken off your clothing ,COMMA you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you 
Thank you 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA i wasn't 14 years old .PERIOD 
I wasn't really a rocket scientist .PERIOD but i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory in sunny california ,COMMA where it's warm .PERIOD whereas now i'm in the mid-west ,COMMA and it's cold 
And he told me biosignatures ,COMMA we need to look for a biosignature 
And he said ,COMMA it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life ,COMMA 
But immediately ,COMMA the system goes like ,COMMA what kind of dumb piece of code was this 
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types ,COMMA 
As long as i know that there's some sort of alphabet 
And obviously ,COMMA each of these letters comes off about roughly ,COMMA equally frequent 
And if i look at french texts ,COMMA it looks a little bit different or italian ,COMMA or german 
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem ,COMMA or whether it's a mathematical text ,COMMA 
The avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity ,COMMA 
Too hot too hot 
And i'm just showing this to you again ,COMMA because it's so nice 
One of them is ,COMMA if we are able to think about life in abstract terms -- and we're not talking about things like plants ,COMMA and we're not talking about amino acids ,COMMA and we're not talking about bacteria ,COMMA but we think ,COMMA in terms of processes -- then we could start to think about life ,COMMA not as something that is so special to earth ,COMMA but that in fact ,COMMA could exist anywhere 
But what really turns me on about technology is not just the ability to get more songs on mp3 players .PERIOD 
What i would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints .PERIOD 
Political economic psychological ,COMMA whatever 
Don't ask 
Well ,COMMA i turned him down 
That's not a cause .PERIOD that's an emergency 
And what we're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality 
That's right 
We like to give and we give a lot 
You see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice 
Africa is a continent in flames 
Anyway ,COMMA i believe that that kind of thinking offends the intellectual rigor in this room ,COMMA 
There's an opportunity here ,COMMA and it's real 
Our credibility 
I can't you can't as individuals ,COMMA but we can change the world 
But working together ,COMMA we can actually change the world 
Ideas that you gestated in your youth 
Well now ,COMMA actually ,COMMA because of you ,COMMA it is possible to change the physical world ,COMMA 
So why then are we not pumping our fists into the air 
But for the first time in history ,COMMA we have the technology ,COMMA we have the know-how .PERIOD we have the cash .PERIOD we have the life-saving drugs 
The clash wore big army boots ;SEMICOLON not sandals .PERIOD 
But some of them ,COMMA they haven't 
Not only in lives saved ,COMMA but in goodwill ,COMMA stability and security that we'll gain 
What i hope is that beyond individual merciful acts ,COMMA that you will tell the politicians to do right by africa by america .PERIOD and by the world ,COMMA 
Give us that kind of dreaming that kind of doing 
The war against terror .PERIOD yes ,COMMA 
Actually we're talking to abc today ,COMMA about the oscars 
We need to get the math we need to get the statistics out to the american people 
One by one they step forward ,COMMA a nurse :COLON a teacher ,COMMA a homemaker ,COMMA and lives are saved 
We can make history 
We can start to make poverty history 
The idea that the internet ,COMMA which changed all of our lives can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to analog ,COMMA let alone digital -- blows my mind ,COMMA 
Communication is very important for ethiopia -- will transform the country 
I am ,COMMA of course ,COMMA referring to none other than elvis presley 
And love is not love ,COMMA but being all shook up 
Does that correspond 
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another 
One of the sentences was some jobs are jails 
And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing .PERIOD pursuing a goal 
But there is a better translation 
The latin word :COLON cogito is derived from the prefix co ,COMMA meaning together ,COMMA and the verb agitare ,COMMA meaning to shake 
And in that sense ,COMMA ballooning is a beautiful metaphor 
We want to go in a direction ,COMMA but the winds push us in another direction ,COMMA like in life ,COMMA 
And as long as we fight horizontally against life ,COMMA against the winds ,COMMA against what's happening to us .PERIOD life is a nightmare 
How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day 
It's not true 
This is very practical 
This is why you need people with long-term vision .PERIOD 
But we were expected to have doubts .PERIOD we're expected to have fears 
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles 
We landed with 40 kilos 
I had no idea how it was possible 
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together ,COMMA with the airplane of charles lindbergh ,COMMA with apollo 11 with the wright brothers' flyer with chuck yeager's .PERIOD 61 ,COMMA i had really a thought ,COMMA then 
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now ,COMMA 
Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies ,COMMA than the potential of it .PERIOD 
The goal is to take off end of this year for the first test ,COMMA but mainly next year ,COMMA spring or summer ,COMMA take off on our own power ,COMMA without additional help without being towed ,COMMA climb to 9000 meters altitude .PERIOD 
So you see that this airplane is more a symbol 
I don't think it will transport .PERIOD 200 people in the next years 
And 20 years later ,COMMA there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the atlantic .PERIOD 
And each time we have some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great .PERIOD and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice ,COMMA to go through the obstacle to go through the problem .PERIOD in order to see what there is on the other side .PERIOD 
I wish i could show you my yemen 
It was very hard ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to impose my authority 
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do 
It's about proving who you are ,COMMA and what you can do 
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have ,COMMA you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society .PERIOD and the one that you are now creating at the paper 
And this is true 
Well ,COMMA the yemen times across 20 years has been through so much 
They think that if there's anything against them ,COMMA then we are being an opposition newspaper 
And very ,COMMA very difficult times ,COMMA 
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu 
That thing 
I'm not so old 
Actually that's a documentary that's available online .PERIOD the video's online ,COMMA 
And certainly you yourself ,COMMA and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for 
On twitter also 
And it doesn't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue 
It's the number one contaminant of groundwater ,COMMA drinking water ,COMMA rain water ,COMMA 
In some cases ,COMMA another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine ,COMMA grew eggs in their testes .PERIOD 
Normally the testes should make testosterone ,COMMA the male hormone 
In fact ,COMMA this aromatase is so important in breast cancer that the latest treatment for breast cancer is a chemical called letrozole ,COMMA which blocks aromatase ,COMMA blocks estrogen ,COMMA so that if you developed a mutated cell ,COMMA it doesn't grow into a tumor .PERIOD 
Pjc ,COMMA so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a ,COMMA bpa ,COMMA which has been in the news recently ,COMMA 
So we're dosing our babies ,COMMA our newborns .PERIOD our infants ,COMMA with a synthetic estrogen 
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother was exposed to 
And given the life of many of these chemicals ,COMMA generations ,COMMA years ,COMMA dozens of years ,COMMA that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren's grandchildren ,COMMA by things that we're putting into the environment today ,COMMA 
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago .PERIOD when i found out i was pregnant ,COMMA and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb and the second scan revealed .PERIOD no heartbeat 
We know so much about global warming and climate change .PERIOD and yet we have no concept of what i've been calling internal environmentalism .PERIOD 
I'm not married ,COMMA but one year ago ,COMMA today i woke up from a month-long coma ,COMMA following a double lung transplant

My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph .PERIOD but after six months ,COMMA i couldn't walk up a small hill .PERIOD i couldn't climb a flight of stairs .PERIOD 
Mine was 146 
Doctors ,COMMA insert a catheter into your chest ,COMMA which is attached to a pump that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds 
Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx ,COMMA hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly 
Against my doctors' and family's wishes ,COMMA i needed to go back for the funeral .PERIOD 
I was dying .PERIOD and if i didn't mix that stuff up fast ,COMMA i would never leave that apartment alive 
I went back to the states ,COMMA anticipating i'd return to europe ,COMMA but the heart catheterization showed that i wasn't going anywhere further that a flight-for-life from johns hopkins hospital 
A happy patient is a healthy patient 
And it was right-heart failure 
It was a match 
Because despite their problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs .PERIOD and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up 
They left my chest open for two weeks .PERIOD 
An infection ravaged my skin 
If they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again .PERIOD 
There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body 
I couldn't walk ,COMMA i couldn't talk .PERIOD i couldn't eat .PERIOD i couldn't move .PERIOD i certainly couldn't sing .PERIOD i couldn't even breathe .PERIOD but when i looked up ,COMMA and i saw my mother ,COMMA i couldn't help ,COMMA but smile 
Whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs .PERIOD death happens 
But life isn't really just about avoiding death ,COMMA is it 
Life magazine helped in this effort ,COMMA by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes 
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream 
In spite of deposit fees ,COMMA much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .PERIOD 
Isla san roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off baja's sparsely populated central coast .PERIOD 
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them 
A four-month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach .PERIOD 
That day i ended up spending nearly 60 
And this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to washington 
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills 
But no fishmonger on earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish 
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall ,COMMA 
I became very interested .PERIOD and i wrote about a couple 
His friend ,COMMA a guy named marwood harris was following behind 
But they made it to the top ,COMMA and what they found was not a redwood desert ,COMMA but a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air ,COMMA filled with unknown life 
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees ,COMMA 
That's my son oliver 
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny ,COMMA then children are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest .PERIOD 
You ascend 30 stories 
And there's also something that i want to show you 
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees ,COMMA 
We're looking at the very top of gaya ,COMMA which is thought to be the oldest redwood 
What can the redwoods tell us about ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK 
The flickering ,COMMA transitory quality of human time and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love ,COMMA 
And i think that one of the happiest things is the sense that with my children ,COMMA i've been able to introduce them into the very small circle of humans ,COMMA who are lucky enough ,COMMA or possibly stupid enough to still climb trees .PERIOD 
But that's just a very small facet of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide ,COMMA all through the ecosystems ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA the earth itself -- ca :COLON partly caused by us ,COMMA inadvertently 
Thank you 
We know ,COMMA because it says so inside the code 
And basit and amjad are first names .PERIOD pakistani .PERIOD first names .PERIOD 
So half a year ago ,COMMA i decided to go to pakistan myself 
And i knocked on the door ,COMMA 
You want to guess who opened the door 
So let me just run some viruses on my computer .PERIOD 
Let me show you one ,COMMA which actually makes some sound 
We find guys like bjorn sundin originally from sweden and his partner in crime ,COMMA also listed on the interpol wanted pages .PERIOD mr .PERIOD shaileshkumar jain a us citizen ,COMMA 
Now criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before can reach us 
But even more interestingly ,COMMA if we continue decrypting ,COMMA we'll find this mysterious string ,COMMA which says o600ko78rus ,COMMA 
It's not used for anything 
I got zero hits wasn't there 
So i spoke with the guys at the lab 
And on this blog ,COMMA he blogs about his life about his life ,COMMA in st .PERIOD petersburg -- he's in his early 20s -- about his cat ,COMMA about his girlfriend .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this guy drives a mercedes-benz .PERIOD s600 v12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower 
The vast majority of the online crime cases ,COMMA we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from 
Plc's ,COMMA these small boxes ,COMMA which have no display ,COMMA no keyboard ,COMMA which are programmed are put in place .PERIOD and they do their job 
You go to any factory ,COMMA any power plant any chemical plant ,COMMA any food processing plant .PERIOD you look around -- everything is being run by computers .PERIOD 
I'm worried that we are running into problems because of online crime 
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators 
I don't have a clue 
Mother theresa .PERIOD she was rational 
So we have to work out who influences problems 
There are lots of people shaping decisions .PERIOD and so if we want to predict correctly we have to pay attention to everybody who is trying to shape the outcome .PERIOD not just the people at the pinnacle of the decision-making pyramid ,COMMA 
So with just that little bit of input ,COMMA we can work out what the choices are that people have what the chances are that they're willing to take what they're after ,COMMA what they value what they want ?QUESTIONMARK and what they believe about other people 
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate 
What's its future 
Over here ,COMMA you can see .PERIOD this is the distribution of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today .PERIOD this is what that power block is predicted to be like by the late parts of 2010 ,COMMA early parts of 2011 
That power disappears completely .PERIOD nobody supports that by 2011 ,COMMA 
Here is mr .PERIOD ahmadinejad 
He is on the way down 
Everything is not predictable .PERIOD the stock market is at least for me ,COMMA not predictable ,COMMA but most complicated negotiations are predictable .PERIOD 
And if you engineer what they do ,COMMA you can change the world .PERIOD you can get a better result .PERIOD 
So i've had an obsession basically for 30 years ,COMMA and that obsession has been what makes the difference in the quality of peoples lives .PERIOD 
Whether it be your business ,COMMA your contribution to society ,COMMA money -- whatever it is for you -- your body ,COMMA your family 
But the other lesson of life ,COMMA that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment .PERIOD 
Because science is easy right 
And everybody in this room -- you wouldn't be in this room ,COMMA if you bought that theory -- but the -- most of society ,COMMA thinks biography is destiny .PERIOD 
Audience .PERIOD aye .PERIOD 
Al gore :COLON supreme court 
If you don't have the money ,COMMA but you're creative and determined enough ,COMMA you find the way .PERIOD so this is the ultimate resource 
In this second consciously or unconsciously ,COMMA the minute you decide to focus on something you've got to give it a meaning and whatever that meaning is produces emotion 
Honestly better or worse ,COMMA say .PERIOD aye .PERIOD 
How would their lives be different ,COMMA their impact 
Audience .PERIOD aye .PERIOD 
Let me tell you what they are .PERIOD first one certainty ,COMMA 
So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species 
I said ,COMMA focus on .PERIOD 'there's food' -- what a concept ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
Second -- but this is what changed my life .PERIOD this is what shaped me as a human being -- somebody's gift 
10 seconds that's all i want to be respectful .PERIOD 10 seconds 
If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes ,COMMA you might dismiss them as poor and simple 
We will not be there 
Mau is a palu ,COMMA a navigator priest 
Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the pacific ,COMMA without the use of instruments ,COMMA 
The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance 
Their achievements ,COMMA intellectually and scientifically ,COMMA are extraordinary ,COMMA and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms 
We cannot afford to lose it 
The link between the past and the future is fragile 
I am haunted by the fact that i no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains .PERIOD 
And i am reminded that throughout the world ,COMMA there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them as potent as the micronesian navigators that are going dismissed .PERIOD that this is a testament to brilliant :COLON brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly ,COMMA 
Youtube cares deeply about the rights of content owners ,COMMA but in order to give them choices about what they can do with copies ,COMMA mashups and more ,COMMA we need to first identify when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site .PERIOD 
Because sony music had registered chris brown's video in our content id system within seconds of attempting to upload the video ,COMMA the copy was detected ,COMMA giving sony the choice of what to do next 
The video's inspired over 26000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why has no one ever solved this problem before 
But it's not just about dollars and impressions 
♫ billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of carnegie hall ♫ ♫ famous jazz singer gone ,COMMA awol ♫ ♫ must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ on a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ she was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear .PERIOD ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫ ♫ but love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ by daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ over the frozen river home ♫ ♫ me and johnny walker .PERIOD ♫ ♫ see in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ billie time ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says ♫ ♫ this time it's love ♫ so i really consider myself a storyteller ,COMMA 
Since the dawn of human history ,COMMA we've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art ,COMMA writing poems ,COMMA singing songs ,COMMA scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper ,COMMA gossiping with friends .PERIOD this is nothing new 
It's been running for about a year and a half 
And i'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then ,COMMA visualized .PERIOD so this is ,COMMA we feel fine 
The dots exhibit human qualities ,COMMA they kind of have their own physics ,COMMA and they swarm wildly around ,COMMA kind of exploring the world of life .PERIOD 
And then they also exhibit curiosity 
There's also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds 
And then one by one in reverse chronological order ,COMMA they excuse themselves ,COMMA entering the scrolling list of feelings 
I feel invisible to you 
I feel in love with carolyn .PERIOD i feel so naughty 
This is in response to what's beautiful miss world 
And it caused me to wonder about our world today 
And those are the questions that inspired my new project ,COMMA which is debuting here today at ted ,COMMA 
It's called universe ,COMMA revealing our modern .PERIOD mythology 
This is the universe of 2007 .PERIOD the last two months 
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe 
So we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama 
You can see that this is an important story .PERIOD there are a lot of things in its orbit .PERIOD if we open this up ,COMMA we get different perspectives on this story .PERIOD 
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be 
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world ,COMMA and then see ,COMMA what the constellations of those might look like 
We're facing this problem 
There is the problem 
And you know ,COMMA going back ,COMMA maybe 10 years in time ,COMMA when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine 
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything 
This is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA all the data is inside .PERIOD so i can start rotating .PERIOD i can look at it from different angles .PERIOD and i can see that this woman had a problem 
And one of the applications that we've been working on -- and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide -- is the application of virtual autopsies .PERIOD 
So this is from a virtual autopsy 
The person was killed by stabs in the heart ,COMMA but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs .PERIOD 
Here's another case that i think is interesting 
During a physical autopsy .PERIOD if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments ,COMMA that's actually quite hard to do 
So if you have the opportunity ,COMMA please try it out 
It's really a hands-on experience 
And this is a bit of science fiction now ,COMMA so we're moving into really the future 
And he's also hearing our instructions ,COMMA when we tell him to do things 
And in just a second here ,COMMA you will see -- okay ,COMMA here motts now move your left foot 
I can look inside of it 
And here it is here is the nose of the bear 
Well ,COMMA 80 percent of the men in lesotho ,COMMA worked in the mines .PERIOD over the border ,COMMA in brutal conditions ,COMMA 
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village 
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang ,COMMA and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe .PERIOD 
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this .PERIOD but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know 
And there've been bangs in the past ,COMMA and there will be bangs in the future 
What about africa 
It's still going on 
What about africa's capacity to do something about these problems 
Well ,COMMA here's the number of physicians in africa 
And while i was busy working -- i was working on these colliding worlds ,COMMA in the day ,COMMA 
And we got lots of applicants 
You have to rethink ,COMMA what is the university for 
No droning on at the chalkboard 
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 .PERIOD am 
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa's development ,COMMA because in those areas ,COMMA scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage 
They'll publish be invited to conferences 
And aims has done extremely well .PERIOD 
Five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one in the us or europe ,COMMA 
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital .PERIOD 
Here are the current students at aims .PERIOD there are 53 of them from 20 different countries ,COMMA including 20 women ,COMMA 
So now i'm going to get to my ted business 
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .PERIOD 
And she's now at aims 
And our wish has two parts .PERIOD one is a dream and the other's a plan .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african 
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills .PERIOD 
Over the last year we've been visiting sites in africa ,COMMA looking at potential sites for new aims centers .PERIOD 
So we have political support right across the continent 
But nobody was really worried about this 
This is a quote ,COMMA actually from alan turing in 30 years ,COMMA it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person 
This was in 1946 ,COMMA and now in 2007 ,COMMA it's still not true .PERIOD 
That's how much power this computer uses 
Rory is a graduate student at stanford 
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second ,COMMA which is actually about very similar to what blue gene does 
And let me just summarize so the bottom line ,COMMA the brain processes information using 100000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have 
So this clip is from the pbs series ,COMMA the secret life of the brain 
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now ,COMMA as you're watching this 
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor 
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one and the absence of current to represent a zero 
But when it's open ,COMMA because these ions have to line up and flow through one at a time ,COMMA you get a kind of sporadic ,COMMA not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current 
In fact ,COMMA there's about 12 .PERIOD electrons can all be flowing this way ,COMMA 
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections 
This is kareem's dark eyes .PERIOD and that's the white background that you see here 
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve 
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
And i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it 
I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive ,COMMA what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy ,COMMA 
But today ,COMMA the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it ,COMMA as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA why is it so important 
Now ,COMMA the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is 
It depends only on the mass of the object ,COMMA 
There are big ones .PERIOD there are little ones 
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy .PERIOD just to give you a sense of scale ,COMMA 
So at the center there ,COMMA that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from 
So you can't see the black hole itself ,COMMA but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light .PERIOD we see 
And if there is a supermassive black hole ,COMMA what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet 
And we live in the middle of it .PERIOD so when we look towards the center ,COMMA we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA or line that defines the plane of the galaxy ,COMMA 
It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit 
So this is great ,COMMA because remember ,COMMA my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume 
So i want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible 
Because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible 
And that buys us about a factor of 20 
So without this technology ,COMMA you can't see the stars 
And this one ,COMMA this one goes around in a human lifetime ,COMMA 
And the truth is ,COMMA i'm not quite there .PERIOD 
But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass .PERIOD 
Likewise for the young stars ,COMMA or in contrast ,COMMA the young stars ,COMMA they just should not be there 
Using observations that are not the ones i've shown you today .PERIOD we can actually figure out which ones are old ,COMMA and which ones are young 
The old ones are red 
He didn't read a note ,COMMA and he was profoundly hearing impaired 
And the thing about classical music that what and how it's inexhaustible 
And a tough ,COMMA slouchy kid got up to bat ,COMMA and he took a swing and really connected 
Brah dada dadadadah 
And whether we call them 440 per second ,COMMA a or 3729 b ,COMMA flat -- trust me ,COMMA that's right -- they're just phenomena 
And in the 17th century ,COMMA it was more like this 
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition 
So in the first eight centuries ,COMMA or so of this tradition ,COMMA the big 'what' was to praise god 
The 'how' was a style called polyphony ,COMMA music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in ptolemy's geocentric universe .PERIOD 
Ah ,COMMA avaricious heaven 
And the chords ,COMMA it turned out were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions ,COMMA 
It's just these two notes in the middle 
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues ,COMMA like gripping ones of culture ,COMMA such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality 
What happens when the music stops 
Where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK what's left 
It's the passing on part .PERIOD it's the 'why' part of it 
At the same time technology by taking over the role that notation had always played shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way ,COMMA over to the instinctive side 
What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music 
Nobody knows 
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers ,COMMA parents ,COMMA performers -- to be explorers together 
You can start anywhere ramble a bit 
Then these two fellows came along ,COMMA and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight 
But unfortunately ,COMMA it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys .PERIOD 
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this ,COMMA either 
If you'd loan me your gulfstream ,COMMA i'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt 
The story starts with just a single person ,COMMA a child behaving a little .PERIOD strangely 
They're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges 
It's based on hundreds of hours of research of practice ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA here's an example -- pre-internet -- of this machine in action ,COMMA 
I mean ,COMMA you might just be a kid with a webcam ,COMMA but if you can do something that goes viral ,COMMA you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people 
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not -- it can still really make your day 
In fact ,COMMA my colleague ,COMMA june cohen has taken to calling it radical openness ,COMMA because it works for us each time 
By giving away our tedx brand ,COMMA we suddenly have a thousand-plus live experiments in the art of spreading ideas 
We're a social species 
And that's why what i'm excited about .PERIOD and what i think is under-reported ,COMMA is the significance of the rise of online video 
He's a unicyclist 
Jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer-reviewed research on .PERIOD video 
Why do people like watching tedtalks 
500 years ago ,COMMA it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage 
I mean ,COMMA today ,COMMA one person speaking can be seen by millions ,COMMA shedding bright light on potent ideas ,COMMA creating intense desire for learning and to respond -- and in his case ,COMMA intense desire to laugh ,COMMA 
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and crucially ,COMMA to respond completing the cycle 
And so ,COMMA as we've thought about this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's become clear to us .PERIOD what the next stage of ted's evolution has to be 
They used the same trash to form green manure .PERIOD 
Thank you 
The name abegg -- abegg is ,COMMA actually a-b-e-g-g .PERIOD and that's the main theme in the melody 
What i do first is ,COMMA i make a lot of little musical ideas -- you can just improvise here at the piano -- and i choose one of those to become my main theme ,COMMA my main melody ,COMMA like the abegg that you just heard 
So ,COMMA for inspiration ,COMMA i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky ,COMMA and all the great romantic composers 
And once i realized it ,COMMA there's a parallel between creating music and creating art ,COMMA because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing ,COMMA it's your character -- you want to decide who do you want to draw ,COMMA or if you want to draw an original character 
Like am i going to use one page 
Am i going to use a two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect ,COMMA i guess 
Instead ,COMMA i'd like to try something called improvisation 
And that's a huge amount of data 
And the more technical topics ,COMMA such as architecture materials and strangely enough ,COMMA men ,COMMA those are not good topics to talk about 
Ingenious tedtalks ,COMMA much more this green color ;SEMICOLON etc .PERIOD et 
Now since this is tedactive ,COMMA and i learned from my analysis that i should actually give you something ,COMMA i will not impose the ultimate or worst tedtalk on you .PERIOD but rather give you a tool to create your own 
And i call this tool .PERIOD the tedpad 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you combine this very simple ,COMMA very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics ,COMMA some of which we were just hearing about again ,COMMA i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being in happiness ,COMMA in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA i can't in the time i've got give huge numbers of examples .PERIOD but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change 
And this is so obvious in a way ,COMMA because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop ,COMMA the way we travel ,COMMA the way that business is done 
We want to get people to be more energy ,COMMA efficient 
Obviously here we have jfk with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation ,COMMA ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country ,COMMA an incredibly noble sentiment 
But when he made that speech ,COMMA what could you do to build the stronger better society 
And i think an even more wonderful speech ,COMMA which i'm going to read a big chunk of which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money and more that we should try and measure than money 
Some say up to five tons 
They're fantastic creatures 
So they were incredibly important animals 
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language 
And most of what we do know ,COMMA is based on their habit of coming to the surface 
And we try to guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface ,COMMA 
And we tagged them very simply ,COMMA not very hi-tech ,COMMA with a big long pole .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA sharks ,COMMA fish are underwater .PERIOD most of the time 
And here's a couple of maps that we've done 
That one you can see that we tagged both off kerry 
So he did another study using microsatellites ,COMMA which are much more expensive ,COMMA much more time consuming .PERIOD and to his surprise came up with almost identical results 
And it's thought ,COMMA maybe it was a bottleneck ,COMMA a genetic bottleneck thought to be 12000 years ago .PERIOD and this has caused a very low diversity 
But the average of all ,COMMA these studies came out -- the mean is about 5000 ,COMMA which i personally don't believe ,COMMA but then i am a skeptic 
In fact of those 20000 8000 were thought to be females 
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail .PERIOD 
And some are caught in nets .PERIOD in trawls 
And in about half an hour ,COMMA we got five samples .PERIOD five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark .PERIOD slime sampling system 
And i was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins .PERIOD 
And what you're trying to look at is the males have claspers ,COMMA which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark 
And you just want to learn as much as you can ,COMMA as soon as you can 
Philosophers ,COMMA dramatists ,COMMA theologians have grappled with this question for centuries .PERIOD what makes people go wrong 
So when i read ,COMMA robert louis stevenson ,COMMA that wasn't fiction .PERIOD 
And apparently ,COMMA he disobeyed god ,COMMA and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority .PERIOD 
I became an expert witness for one of the guards ,COMMA sergeant chip frederick .PERIOD and in that position ,COMMA i had access to the dozen investigative reports 
I had access to him ,COMMA i could study him have him come to my home get to know him do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple 
Why tier 1-a was the center for military intelligence 
That's one of the visual illustrations of evil ,COMMA 
Who are the bad apples ?QUESTIONMARK well that's a bad question .PERIOD 
And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual -- the bad barrel 
And social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that i discovered when i became an expert witness for abu ghraib ,COMMA 
This is stanley milgram little jewish kid from the bronx .PERIOD and he asked the question could the holocaust happen here ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA 
He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room 
And so he's the modern ,COMMA lucifer effect ,COMMA a man of god ,COMMA who becomes the angel of death 
It was a real cop car ,COMMA it was a real policeman ,COMMA and there were real neighbors in the street who didn't know that .PERIOD this was an experiment 
Do they kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate .PERIOD 13 
If you give people power without oversight ,COMMA it's a prescription for abuse .PERIOD they knew that ,COMMA and let that happen 
The answer is nobody .PERIOD and i think nobody on purpose .PERIOD 
Banality of heroism is ,COMMA it's ordinary people who do heroic deeds 
He was a low-level private ,COMMA and that stopped it was .PERIOD he a hero .PERIOD no 
She came down ,COMMA saw that madhouse and said ,COMMA you know what it's terrible ,COMMA what you're doing to those boys 
So the psychology of heroism is -- we're going to end in a moment -- how do we encourage children in new hero courses ,COMMA that i'm working with .PERIOD matt langdon -- he has a hero workshop -- to develop this heroic imagination ,COMMA this self-labeling ,COMMA i am a hero in waiting and teach them skills 
Wesley and the guy -- 20 and a half inches height ,COMMA 
A half an inch would have taken his head off 
Take path one ,COMMA you're going to be a perpetrator of evil .PERIOD 
Path two ,COMMA you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction ,COMMA 
We should ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA because without having this possibility of conscious minds ,COMMA we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity .PERIOD we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world 
So much for the wonder ,COMMA now ,COMMA for the mystery 
And in that image there ,COMMA you see a variety of islands of what i call image-making regions in the brain 
You have the green ,COMMA for example ,COMMA that corresponds to tactile information ,COMMA or the blue ,COMMA that corresponds to auditory information 
But what about the self 
And for a long time ,COMMA people did not even want to touch it ,COMMA because they'd say ,COMMA how can you have this reference point ,COMMA this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ,COMMA 
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day ,COMMA 
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord 
It developed in collectives of human beings 
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made 
And if we are interested ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in the fact that anti-gravity is pulling galaxies away from the earth ,COMMA why should we not be interested in ?QUESTIONMARK what is going on inside of human beings ?QUESTIONMARK 
When i was just a little girl .PERIOD my mom started what is now the longest-running women's film festival in the world .PERIOD 
Fishnet stockings 
I thought they were really hot 
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness 
And one of our biggest successes is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of iowa who say i googled .PERIOD jessica simpson and stumbled on your site 
We don't want one face 
Thank you 
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed 
Which brings me to my third paradox ,COMMA 
You may have guessed by now ,COMMA i did not light myself on fire .PERIOD 
Cornel west says ,COMMA of course it's a failure 
She was talking about board meetings ,COMMA she was founding peace organizations ,COMMA she was coordinating carpools ,COMMA she was consoling friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .PERIOD 
And surely ,COMMA at three and four years old ,COMMA i was listening to the soothing sound of her voice .PERIOD but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist ,COMMA work 
Know thyself 
And we feel like we have to get far far away to a secluded retreat ,COMMA leaving it all behind .PERIOD 
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle 
You may ,COMMA or may not have noticed that i'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead ,COMMA 
Let me show you what it looks like 
Or what if i can take that information and put it into an organic shape up on the screen ,COMMA 
I may also be interested in knowing how focused i am .PERIOD so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side ,COMMA 
And that was responsiveness 
We then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you ,COMMA there's an even more valuable application than that 
In the original zen bound game you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad 
You have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing -- not just how much rope you used ,COMMA or what your high score is ,COMMA but what was going on inside of your mind 
The way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different are challenged with 
Thank you 
So i used to get my eyes tested just for fun 
So let me just tell you the great part of all of this 
And so when i heard that eye specialist tell me all the things a big fat ,COMMA no everybody imagines i was devastated .PERIOD 
The first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying over beside me ,COMMA 
And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad .PERIOD and i would drive 
Oh ,COMMA for the love of god ,COMMA 
I just was so -- how do i tell him 
And then he said to me ,COMMA what did you want to be when you were little 
I know this run so well ,COMMA by the back of my hand ,COMMA 
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with 
And you know ,COMMA the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers 
And nobody can tell me .PERIOD no 
Yes ,COMMA you can say i can't be an archeologist 
I'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant 
And i never thought about noes anymore ,COMMA or not seeing ,COMMA or any of that kind of nothing 
And consequently ,COMMA we can see the result all around us 
I hope it's not the curb cut between the chuck e ,COMMA cheese .PERIOD and the target store because that's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for 
This is the other side of the building 
And what is the message that is coming ,COMMA what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building ?QUESTIONMARK and how is it informing us about who we are 
You know ,COMMA this is a building designed like a dvd player

And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb :COLON the country villa along the railroad line ,COMMA which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city ,COMMA but to return to the countryside .PERIOD every night ,COMMA 
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule 
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head .PERIOD i can't see 
So they take the first one that comes along often 
We're going to have to do something else .PERIOD instead ,COMMA

Biodiversity the living fabric of this planet is not a gas 
And if you look at the species level ,COMMA you saw about fish 
And at this rate at which we are losing fish ,COMMA it is a human problem of enormous dimensions .PERIOD a health problem of a kind ,COMMA we haven't seen before 
The green represents the percentage 
The reason this is happening boils down in my mind to one basic problem ,COMMA which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .PERIOD 
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth ,COMMA simply because it is in the common wealth ,COMMA it's common goods .PERIOD 
It causes pollutants being issued ,COMMA which have an economic cost health cost .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
When we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level ,COMMA we don't include our biggest asset at the country level .PERIOD 
When we measure corporate performances ,COMMA we don't include our impacts on nature .PERIOD and what our business costs society 
That has to stop 
So clearly ,COMMA there was a problem with deforestation .PERIOD 
And i couldn't answer because neither of these companies good ,COMMA though they are ,COMMA and professional ,COMMA though they are do not calculate or disclose their externalities .PERIOD 
That's an example ,COMMA i think for us to look at ,COMMA and for us to draw comfort from 
If more companies did this ,COMMA and if more sectors engaged this ,COMMA as sectors ,COMMA you could have analysts ,COMMA business analysts ,COMMA and you could have people like us ,COMMA and consumers and ngos ,COMMA actually look and compare the social performance of companies

A bit like inflation ,COMMA you over-issue currency ,COMMA you get what you see .PERIOD declining prices 
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations ,COMMA what we have done is we've made an ethical choice 
I decided when i was asked to do this that what i really wanted to talk about was my friend richard feynman 
Richard feynman was a very complex man .PERIOD 
He was a man of many ,COMMA many parts 
It may still exist .PERIOD i don't know 
But it was really brutal 
But the amazing thing was -- feynman had to leave a little early 
Sometimes i would win ,COMMA mostly he would win ,COMMA but we both enjoyed them 
And he said ,COMMA leonardo were you closer to your mother ,COMMA or to you father when you were a kid 
Being dick ,COMMA he of course wanted to check this 
There went that theory down the trashcan of history 
But let me tell you a little bit about feynman .PERIOD the physicist 
He would try to visualize it guided by a small number of simple principles 
It was so simple .PERIOD in fact ,COMMA that i suspect a really smart high school student who didn't even have calculus could understand what he wrote down 
You simply take the proton ,COMMA and you hit it really sharply with an electron 
So i think i'll just finish up by saying ,COMMA i actually don't think feynman would have liked this event .PERIOD 
Thank you 
When this trailer showed up at my shop in berkeley ,COMMA i'd actually never stepped foot in an airstream trailer or any other trailer

Welcome to five dangerous things .PERIOD you should let your children do 
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot 
So ,COMMA where does this trend stop 
And yeah ,COMMA they're going to cut themselves 
So ,COMMA practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes ,COMMA which have to do with visual acuity ,COMMA 3d understanding and structural problem solving .PERIOD so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability 
Number four -- deconstruct appliances 
And it's fun for the whole family 
Narrator ,COMMA we are all aware of the risk of cancer ,COMMA but there's another disease that's destined to affect even more of us .PERIOD arthritis ,COMMA 
This is the field of biologic replacements where we replace worn-out parts with new ,COMMA natural ones ,COMMA 
And it works not just for my wife ,COMMA but certainly for other patients 
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue 
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement 
The space age began 50 years ago in october .PERIOD and that’s exactly what sputnik looked like 
They would bring them back and mount them 
So that’s for fun 
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own guttenberg in 1455 
In 1455 nobody could read 
But why is this so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK here’s the quick story 
That is why the printing press succeeded .PERIOD and that is why martin luther nailed his 90 theses to the door ,COMMA because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .PERIOD 
Instead of showing an object from the stage ,COMMA i’m going to do something special for the first time 
We are going to show ,COMMA actually what the library looks like .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
And all throughout the library are different objects ,COMMA different spaces .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA looking at them ,COMMA you would see a machine and a molecule 
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet 
What that means is ,COMMA a 200-megabyte file looks like this ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD ok .PERIOD 
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design 
So then i can add some color in with the background ,COMMA and add a bit more color in with the words themselves .PERIOD and this way working with the art director i'm able to bring it to just the right point that it's puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there's something they have to read -- but it's not impossible for them to read 
So i'm currently working on a book ,COMMA which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock-like grandeur .PERIOD 
I've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since 2005 
There's a longer story to this ,COMMA but i did get them all done in time ,COMMA and they were extremely well received 
I got an almost 100 percent response rate 
I had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter ,COMMA like a found fragment in their mailbox .PERIOD 
And i specifically wrote four pages that don't connect 
I'm certain i can see you blushing 
So ,COMMA i solicited friends to send me their used christmas cards ,COMMA and i made 500 of these 
What does it say 
So that's why i do what i do ,COMMA and why i spend so much time and effort on it ,COMMA and why i work in the commercial public sphere ,COMMA as opposed to the isolated ,COMMA private sphere of fine art .PERIOD because i want as many people as possible to see my work .PERIOD notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from it 
And i actually really feel that it's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way ,COMMA 
And i thank you for allowing me to show it to you

I got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard 
You have to be kind of smart ,COMMA and though i did not graduate from college doesn't mean i'm stupid ,COMMA because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .PERIOD 
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics ,COMMA 
I have been really lucky with this technology .PERIOD all of a sudden as it is ready .PERIOD the world is ready to accept it 
This unit that i played goes from about 200 hertz ,COMMA to above the range of hearing 
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that's about 100000 vibrations per second ,COMMA 
And the sound that you're hearing ,COMMA unlike a regular speaker on ,COMMA which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air ,COMMA 
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse 
We put it on a turret with a camera ,COMMA so that when they shoot at you ,COMMA you're over there ,COMMA and it's there 
I took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it ,COMMA and they laughed .PERIOD and then i took them back a demo ,COMMA and they bought 
So i've been really lucky as an inventor 
I've got a coke can opening .PERIOD that's right in your head .PERIOD that's really cool .PERIOD 
Appreciate it very much 
I thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials 
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials ,COMMA and there's a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job 
So that's the vision that i've been thinking about 
There's diatoms made out of sio2 ,COMMA and they're magnetotactic bacteria that make small ,COMMA single-domain magnets used for navigation 
And i was really fortunate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit ,COMMA and i really wanted to give him a periodic table .PERIOD 
What if he says ,COMMA 'oh i already have one' or 'i've already ,COMMA memorized .PERIOD it' 
Now if you take all billion viruses ,COMMA and you can put them in one drop of liquid ,COMMA you can force them to interact with anything .PERIOD you want on the periodic table .PERIOD 
So basically viruses can't replicate themselves .PERIOD they need a host 
And so through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking ,COMMA high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature .PERIOD basically at the bench top 
You can make lots of amplifications to it 
When you shine light on them ,COMMA you can see them bubbling 
In this case ,COMMA you're seeing oxygen bubbles .PERIOD come out 
The last example are solar cells 
And what we've found is through genetic engineering ,COMMA we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .PERIOD 
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house ,COMMA the basement .PERIOD the coffee shop ,COMMA the library 
And then you'll hear things like the train ,COMMA a plane ,COMMA a car -- so the commute 
Why is that happening 
You don't have a workday anymore .PERIOD you have work moments 
It's like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart ,COMMA and you walk in .PERIOD and your day is shredded to bits ,COMMA because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there ,COMMA and then something else happens and you're pulled off your work .PERIOD and you've got to do something else .PERIOD then you have 20 minutes .PERIOD then it's lunch .PERIOD 
I sat at my desk ,COMMA i used my expensive computer 
You might have a quick idea ,COMMA but to be in deep thought about a problem ,COMMA and really consider a problem carefully ,COMMA you need long stretches of uninterrupted time 
Now there are different kinds of distractions ,COMMA but there aren't the really bad kinds of distractions that i'll talk about in just a minute 
So sleep is about sleep phases ,COMMA or stages -- some people call them different things 
If you're interrupted and woken up ,COMMA you have to start again .PERIOD 
I don't think anyone would say ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA 
They'll also say -- sometimes they'll also say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i can't see the person ,COMMA how do i know they're working 
Which is ridiculous ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but that's one of the excuses that managers give 
No one cared about letting people take a smoke ,COMMA break for 15 minutes .PERIOD 10 years ago .PERIOD so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here ?QUESTIONMARK and there or twitter here ?QUESTIONMARK and there or youtube here and there 
Those are the real problems in the modern office today 
That's kind of bad 
And meetings are just toxic terrible ,COMMA poisonous things during the day ,COMMA at work .PERIOD 
What if they're doing important work 
If there are 10 people in the meeting ,COMMA it's a 10-hour meeting .PERIOD it's not a one-hour meeting 
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting ,COMMA which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes 
These things don't exist outside of the office 
I have about three minutes ,COMMA so that'll fit perfectly 
I don't know if people still do that 
So just the afternoon ,COMMA one ,COMMA thursday 
This is when people actually get stuff done is when no one's bothering them .PERIOD when no one's interrupting them 
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 am on monday ,COMMA just forget about them ,COMMA and things will be just fine 
And i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future ,COMMA 
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that 
So this is interesting to us ,COMMA because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value .PERIOD 
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys money .PERIOD and if they own one a mobile phone ,COMMA 
And a mobile phone ,COMMA it turns out is a great recovery tool 
But -- and it's a pretty big ,COMMA but -- we forget 
I think quite a nice feature 
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity .PERIOD but over time ,COMMA they gravitate there .PERIOD 
But the difference between this ,COMMA and that is there's no central authority ,COMMA trying to control this 
And ok ,COMMA if you break one of these things here ,COMMA you return it to the carrier 
They'll probably give you three new ones ,COMMA right 
It challenges the norms 
This is how it's shifting 
I'm just the messenger 
And companies like navigenics ,COMMA and dna ,COMMA direct and 23andme that are giving you your genetic profiles ,COMMA are giving some people a sense of gosh .PERIOD well ,COMMA what can i do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so my request is ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK let's make technologies that make people more human and not less 
I made a lot of mistakes and dumb decisions ,COMMA of course ,COMMA 
So let's say ,COMMA for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding ,COMMA and you're trying to get to the airport ,COMMA and you're stuck in terrible traffic .PERIOD and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight .PERIOD 
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have 
Odds are you're not going to care in five years 
It feels terrible ,COMMA regret feels awful 
And the thought was make it go away 
We just want it to vanish 
Make it go away ,COMMA make it go away 
In point of fact ,COMMA no insurance covers acts of idiocy 
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life that we desperately want to change ,COMMA and we cannot 
But first ,COMMA i want to say that the intensity and persistence with which we experience these emotional components of regret is obviously going to vary depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about 
The fda estimates that of all ,COMMA the americans who have tattoos ,COMMA 17 percent of us regret getting them 
Now ,COMMA in my case ,COMMA this really wasn't a problem because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself when you're 29 years old ,COMMA and you want your mommy ,COMMA because you don't like your new tattoo 
All right 
And what i loved about ,COMMA this image of the compass was that i felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image 
Even in wealthy countries ,COMMA it is common now to see inequality growing 
In the united states since 2001 ,COMMA we've had five years of economic growth .PERIOD five years of productivity growth in the workplace ,COMMA but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent 
It is also unstable 
Because primarily of the power of the internet .PERIOD people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money that can change the world for some public good .PERIOD if they all agree 
You saw one reference to that ,COMMA in what we were able to do with aids drugs 
When i got out of office and was asked to work first in the caribbean to try to help deal with the aids crisis ,COMMA generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year 
We need a movie on those six categories 
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains and to organize yourselves around it 
You think about whatever your life has been ,COMMA however ,COMMA many obstacles you have faced in your life ,COMMA at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted .PERIOD and the result you achieved 
As poor as haiti is in the area where farmer's clinic is active -- and they serve a catchment area far greater than the medical professionals ,COMMA they have would indicate they could serve -- since 1988 ,COMMA they have not lost one person to tuberculosis ,COMMA not one 
We're essentially implementing what paul farmer did in haiti ,COMMA he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems ,COMMA ensure that people who have aids or tb are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly who work on bringing about health education ,COMMA clean water and sanitation ,COMMA providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care ,COMMA if they have problems of the severity that require it 
The procedures that make this work have been perfected ,COMMA as i said by paul farmer and his team in their work in rural haiti over the last 20 years 
And the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it 
And then we have others working in these other related programs .PERIOD 
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay 
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for aids or tuberculosis .PERIOD 
Listen to this ,COMMA less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment .PERIOD 
We're now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda ,COMMA and our foundation folks to scale this system up 
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health administration and community health workers throughout the country to set up the information technology ,COMMA the solar energy ,COMMA the water and sanitation ,COMMA the transportation infrastructure .PERIOD 
I had a really hard time in school 
In fact ,COMMA my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .PERIOD 
I ran away 
And when the natural breeze isn't enough ,COMMA the kids deploy bubbles ,COMMA but not the kind of bubbles ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
They know they can control their world 
Landscaping 
They're part of the rice cycle ,COMMA and these skills will be valuable for them in their future .PERIOD 
The food is incredible 
Green school is a place of pioneers ,COMMA local and global .PERIOD 
The kids are from 25 countries 
You practice ancient balinese arts 
The kids love it 
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders 
The green school effect -- we don't know what it is 
And how did we do all this 
It's a double helix 
From the time ,COMMA the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs and floors 
You ruined my life ,COMMA but you gave me an incredible future 
And then a third attempt ,COMMA which also patched me back together pretty well until it failed 
I tried out various computer voices that were available online .PERIOD and for several months ,COMMA i had a british accent which chaz called sir lawrence 
There are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices .PERIOD and i've experimented with them 
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice 
But it wasn't that simple 
Or roger 20 ,COMMA 
This is the first version of my computer voice 
When i read something it will read in my voice 
The voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc 
I plan to use it on television ,COMMA radio and the internet 
People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems ,COMMA 
John hunter ,COMMA all my life ,COMMA i was a motormouth 
I doubt on that day ,COMMA 50 years ago ,COMMA they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished 
But that's not the point 
I have learned from wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning ,COMMA plato ,COMMA established forums ,COMMA message boards ,COMMA online testing ,COMMA email ,COMMA chat rooms ,COMMA picture languages ,COMMA instant messaging ,COMMA remote screen sharing and multiple-player games .PERIOD 
But online everybody speaks at the same speed .PERIOD

Let me tell you my story 
I came to london ,COMMA and i've seen performance by cirque du soleil .PERIOD 
I wanted my artistic statement ,COMMA my interpretation of reality 
The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece as one composition -- like music ,COMMA 
And design is responsible for this experience .PERIOD 
What really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too .PERIOD 
Same in poland ,COMMA plus 13 up to 35 percent ,COMMA raise of circulation after three years 
You can work for a small company in a boring ,COMMA branch 
So bear with me as i take you through this journey ,COMMA 
I was running across the street .PERIOD and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head .PERIOD 
And i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck ,COMMA and my mouth 
I had no idea what was going on ,COMMA but strangers intervened ,COMMA kept my heart moving beating 
I had lots of titanium put in me ,COMMA cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way 
And i needed that wisdom at that moment in my life 
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs 
So they figured not being able to see is one thing ,COMMA but they need to get me to talk 
The redundancy was actually good for me 
So everything is different when you're a sighted person ,COMMA because you take that for granted 
We didn't have words like crowd-sourcing and radical collaboration .PERIOD when i had my accident .PERIOD 
A peasant ,COMMA who was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from ,COMMA and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor ,COMMA clearly shot by a dueling wound .PERIOD 
Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother 
And the last words ,COMMA he said to his brother were don't cry for me .PERIOD alfred 
But a few years earlier ,COMMA while still at school ,COMMA he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time 
Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the large hadron collider in cern .PERIOD 
Artists too love to play around with symmetry .PERIOD 
Here is thomas mann ,COMMA talking about symmetry .PERIOD in the magic mountain 
And the gateway ,COMMA you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them 
And i said to professor kurokawa ,COMMA wow .PERIOD the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down ,COMMA 
Recently i took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips ,COMMA which my family love 
I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world .PERIOD we live in 
So they explored a more geometric art .PERIOD 
And the power of mathematics is often to change ,COMMA one thing into another ,COMMA to change geometry into language .PERIOD 
Actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept ,COMMA seventh century ad .PERIOD by the indians 
I can reflect it in the line through x or the line ,COMMA through y or the line through z ,COMMA 
So both of these objects have six symmetries 
So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work 
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries .PERIOD so ,COMMA why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries 
And using those rules ,COMMA he was able to say that there are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA only two objects with six symmetries 
And all the tiles match up again ,COMMA 
So there was a sixth of a turn ,COMMA a third of a turn where the z pieces meet 
How many symmetries does a rubik's cube have 
Rather than you all shouting out ,COMMA i want you to count .PERIOD how many digits there are in that number .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
Because this one i think there were a few here 
The people who just last sat down 
And i'd like to review ,COMMA just how unintended consequences play .PERIOD the part that they do 
But he did his best ,COMMA and he kept meticulous records that let him transform that branch of medicine .PERIOD 
So there were benefits in calamities -- benefits to pure science as well as to applied science and medicine 
There are two historians of business at the university of maryland ,COMMA brent ,COMMA goldfarb .PERIOD and david kirsch who have done some extremely interesting work ,COMMA much of it still unpublished ,COMMA on the history of major innovations ,COMMA 
They have combined the list of major innovations ,COMMA and they've discovered that the greatest number the greatest decade for fundamental innovations as reflected in all of the lists that others have made -- a number of lists that they have merged -- was the great depression 
So we see that sometimes ,COMMA as a result of these dislocations ,COMMA as a result of people leaving their original intended career and going into something else where their creativity could make a difference ,COMMA that depressions and all kinds of other unfortunate events can have a paradoxically stimulating effect on creativity 
We need to see what they can do for us 
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing 
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system ,COMMA 
Also just like paper ,COMMA around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later ,COMMA and i can do the same thing here .PERIOD and you know ,COMMA you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices .PERIOD 
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned ,COMMA 
The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there 
But i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth ,COMMA and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math ,COMMA but math in general 
And he said ,COMMA it's funny ,COMMA you ask that ,COMMA because it's actually called black box trading 
There's a company in boston called nanex ,COMMA and they use math and magic ,COMMA and i don't know what .PERIOD and they reach into all the market data ,COMMA and they find actually sometimes some of these algorithms 
And when they find them ,COMMA they pull them out ,COMMA and they pin them to the wall like butterflies 
Pragmatic chaos is like all of netflix algorithms ,COMMA trying to do the same thing .PERIOD 
Pragmatic chaos like all netflix algorithms determines in the end .PERIOD 60 percent of what movies end up being rented 
Wouldn't that be handy 
And it uses what's called a bin-packing algorithm 
And this is really where the wires come right up into the city 
But before i dive into those ,COMMA i want to admit that i am an optimist ,COMMA 
And part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past 
Another statistic ,COMMA perhaps my favorite is to look at childhood deaths 
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again ,COMMA 
Why ,COMMA well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths .PERIOD diarrhea ,COMMA pneumonia and malaria 
And the disease was all over the world 
And two tools helped bring the death rate down 
But malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact 
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it 
And bed nets are a great tool .PERIOD 
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective 
It involves communicators to keep the funding high to keep the visibility high ,COMMA to tell the success stories 
It involves social scientists ,COMMA so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets ,COMMA but 90 percent 
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on ,COMMA and we'd understand very well .PERIOD 
Let's start with why this is important 
Not only has that been weak ,COMMA it's getting weaker 
And the answer is no 
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .PERIOD 
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools ,COMMA some high schools -- and what goes on is great teaching 
If you have a kid who's behind ,COMMA you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept 
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book ,COMMA 
I only have three minutes ,COMMA so i'm going to have to talk fast ,COMMA and it will use up your spare mental cycles .PERIOD so multitasking may be hard 
So it's logical that you'd have one there on the minor road entering the major 
And so the question is ,COMMA what does that cost us 
That's just the gasoline cost .PERIOD there is also pollution ,COMMA wear on the car and time 
Discount that back to the present at five percent over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you look at what that adjacent property is worth ,COMMA you could actually buy the property ,COMMA cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line .PERIOD and then sell it off .PERIOD again .PERIOD 
And because we no longer need to use sunlight ,COMMA we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room 
And this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence 
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table ,COMMA 
But then we actually don't know that it's all out 
And we wait 
So now you're faced with telling your patient .PERIOD first of all that they may need another surgery ,COMMA or that they need additional therapy ,COMMA such as radiation or chemotherapy .PERIOD 
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface ,COMMA you'll still be able to see it 
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road 
So with our technology ,COMMA we can tell right away 
Nerves if they are injured ,COMMA can cause paralysis can cause pain 
But you know what these little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer that they are actually never seen 
People said we've been doing it this way for all these years 
But i went ahead .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA 
We have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing -- every single nerve -- nerves for urinary function around the prostate 
I have patients who would benefit from this 
I think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications .PERIOD 
And this takes the long-term steady ,COMMA courage of the day-in ,COMMA day-out struggle ,COMMA to educate to persuade and to win acceptance .PERIOD 
And that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today ,COMMA 
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs ,COMMA which then ,COMMA if they pass a certain threshold ,COMMA will go to thousands of downstream partners 
If we could activate cells ,COMMA we could see what powers they can unleash ,COMMA what they can initiate and sustain 
Now ,COMMA in the 20th century ,COMMA there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders .PERIOD and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders ,COMMA practically none of them can be considered to be cured .PERIOD 
There's one other magic trick ,COMMA you need to make this all happen .PERIOD and that's the ability to get light into the brain .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do we do this 
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear 
And over time -- in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA which is a good animal model ,COMMA commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone 
The animal will react by freezing ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA like a deer in the headlights ,COMMA 
Now i want to close on one story ,COMMA which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra-precise control ,COMMA can be used in the brain itself ,COMMA to make a new kind of prosthetic ,COMMA an optical prosthetic 
Maybe 100000 people have cochlear implants ,COMMA which allow them to hear 
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus ,COMMA which probably most of us around this room have ,COMMA and it doesn't have any symptoms ,COMMA which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain ,COMMA or the body 
And the retina ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a complex structure 
We're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina ,COMMA in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light ,COMMA sensitive 
So this pre-clinical study ,COMMA i think ,COMMA bodes hope for the kinds of things .PERIOD we're hoping to do in the future 
And by turning things off ,COMMA it's more or less a zero 
Does that mean that some day you could download memories ,COMMA and maybe upload them 
What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors 
And we looked at three different types of rooms 
Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings 
I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut ,COMMA 
And obviously ,COMMA i'm physically a very strong person as you can tell -- -- so i wasn't worried about carrying this thing .PERIOD 20 blocks 
People were out 
And i thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is the power of a city 
But the system itself of this city was thriving ,COMMA 
Everybody contributes a little bit 
Well ,COMMA it was the whole city 
So it's been a very optimistic time .PERIOD i think ,COMMA and i want to just talk about a few of those things 
That is -- you know ,COMMA there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that ,COMMA i think ,COMMA which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it .PERIOD and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link ,COMMA or not click on that link .PERIOD 
But it's still a very one-to-one kind of relationship 
About two months ago ,COMMA i had the great breakthrough -- one of my great kind of shining achievements -- which is that my website finally became a top result .PERIOD for steven johnson 
And in fact ,COMMA i think that's not entirely true anymore .PERIOD 
That little list there would change 
That's not necessarily something .PERIOD we didn't know already 
I had no idea 
But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there 
They're talking about slavery in 1860 
And ok ,COMMA i didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious .PERIOD 
I'll go very quickly 
It's caused a lot of controversy ,COMMA because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man ,COMMA one modem democracy ,COMMA where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard 
And the question was were the birds singing 
Well in my world ,COMMA this is a rubber duck 
That was a nice thing to get 
If the end game is global warming ,COMMA they're doing great 
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change which requires humility ,COMMA and in my business ,COMMA as an architect ,COMMA it's unfortunate the word humility .PERIOD and the word architect have not appeared in the same paragraph since the fountainhead 
There is an infinite game ,COMMA and we're playing in that infinite game .PERIOD 
And so we call it cradle to cradle .PERIOD and our goal is very simple .PERIOD 
This is what i presented to the white house 
So we've designed products and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million 
We can ask ourselves ,COMMA what is justice and is justice blind ,COMMA or is justice .PERIOD blindness 
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe 
Here's dr .PERIOD venkataswamy .PERIOD in india who's figured out how to do mass-produced health 
They become building steel 
My childhood summers were in the puget sound of washington among the first growth and big growth 
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the olympics .PERIOD so i have a lot of tree karma i am working off 
So all of a sudden ,COMMA here i am graduating from high school in 1969 ,COMMA and this happens ,COMMA and we realize that away went away 
Now ,COMMA if we look at the word competition ,COMMA i'm sure most of you've used it 
You know ,COMMA most people don't realize it comes from the latin competere ,COMMA which means strive together 
It means the way olympic athletes ,COMMA train with each other 
So we've been looking at the idea of competition as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together .PERIOD 
Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good .PERIOD because in our lexicon ,COMMA asphalt is two words .PERIOD assigning blame 
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition 
Customers 
Biotechnical nutrients -- the model u for ford motor ,COMMA a cradle to cradle car -- concept car 
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials go back to the industry forever .PERIOD some of the materials go back to soil -- it's all solar-powered 
We're doing 12 cities for china ,COMMA right now ,COMMA based on cradle to cradle as templates 
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing for 400 million people in 12 years ,COMMA 
We start to integrate commercial and mixed use .PERIOD so the people all have centers and places to be 
And then it makes natural gas ,COMMA which then goes back into the city to power the fuel for the cooking for the city .PERIOD 
And then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city where we've got farming ,COMMA because what we've done is lifted up the city ,COMMA the landscape into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings .PERIOD 
They're probably less cell dense 
And they're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do 
Because what we're trying to measure the rna -- which is the readout from our genes -- is very labile ,COMMA and so we have to move very quickly 
And then the laser actually cuts 
Now ,COMMA this may look like a bunch of dots to you ,COMMA but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass 
And when we take a sample ,COMMA and we hybridize it to it ,COMMA we get a unique fingerprint ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample ,COMMA 
So roughly we have 50 million data points for a given human brain 
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on 
Genes send the instructions to make proteins 
So drugs ,COMMA bind to proteins and either turn them off ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be 
One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can because it's a pattern matching exercise ,COMMA because there's unique fingerprint .PERIOD we can actually scan through the entire genome and find other proteins that show a similar fingerprint 
Now they can come in ,COMMA and they can start to get clues about activity 
And then we find some outliers some things that lie beyond the cloud .PERIOD 
And those genes are interesting ,COMMA but they're very subtle 
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type 
I think these resources are incredibly valuable 
And there is something else .PERIOD i believe in the back of your mind .PERIOD you also know ,COMMA 
And worst of all ,COMMA we will never know 
And the reason is that -- take africa ,COMMA for example ,COMMA 
Africans have already got a lot of aid 
We don't know 
And a third question education ,COMMA 
And in this way ,COMMA you can take the guesswork out of policy-making by knowing what works what doesn't work .PERIOD and why 
It's going from intention to action 
We cannot keep giving lentils to people 
We can just run an experiment 
Second thing is ,COMMA how about the use 
Well in business ,COMMA that's certainly not the way we would go about it 
Now i'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions .PERIOD 
So now i started from the big problem ,COMMA and i couldn't answer it 
In haiti about 200000 people died -- actually a bit more by the latest estimate ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA why is that 
With deworming ,COMMA you can get an extra year of education for three dollars 
So this evidence is powerful 
It can prompt action 
These economics ,COMMA i'm proposing it's like 20th century .PERIOD medicine 
Fantastic tales ,COMMA anecdotes from speakers 
And turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career 
And she said ,COMMA i want to write a case euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world .PERIOD 
The first thing that i saw was north america at night -- glowing in all its glory ,COMMA a warm feeling light 
Entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope 
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer 
So i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals ,COMMA or signs ,COMMA and winds of change that are sweeping .PERIOD this continent 
And let's start at the high level on the macro-factors .PERIOD 
Egypt from the 16 percent to about 84 percent 
But what were they there for to acquire assets 
Guarantee ,COMMA trust bank ,COMMA recently issued ,COMMA the first euro bond out of africa and this excludes south africa 
22 to 24 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as kuwait the same league ,COMMA as venezuela 
So let's unpack those very quickly ,COMMA and i'm going to move through these very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very fast ,COMMA because i can see that clock counting down 
What else is going on there ,COMMA egypt 
Close to the mediterranean near alexandria -- textiles ,COMMA petrochemicals 
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing 
What's going on in some of the other countries 
But in any investment decision ,COMMA the key question is :COLON what is my alternative investment 
Now when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things and countries in africa vis-a-vis other .PERIOD things comparisons become important ,COMMA 
In 1899 joseph conrad released the heart of darkness ,COMMA a tale of grim horror along the congo river ,COMMA 
Brain magic ,COMMA to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects ,COMMA 
So now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind .PERIOD once ,COMMA you know how 
No ?QUESTIONMARK but you're ok ?QUESTIONMARK yes ?QUESTIONMARK 
That is weird 
Thank you 
Now i'm going to give you some demonstrations up here ,COMMA live right .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
And let's see down at the end here .PERIOD can you also come up real ?QUESTIONMARK quick ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now it's very important for everybody here to realize i haven't set anything up with you guys 
You don't know what's about to happen .PERIOD is that agreed .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA would you mind just standing over here for a moment ,COMMA 
Your name is 
Ok ,COMMA a little bit closer come over -- they look really nervous up here .PERIOD 
Voodoo 
Besides who's next no ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
I want you to be aware of the sensations ,COMMA but don't say anything ,COMMA until i ask you and don't open your eyes until i ask you 
Yes or no ,COMMA did you feel anything 
Yeah ,COMMA i walk around nightclubs all night like this 
And can you take a seat right over here for me ,COMMA if you don't mind 
And i want you to hold it there just for a moment ,COMMA and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop 
Ok ,COMMA and only when you feel the pressure go back ,COMMA i want you to allow your hand to slowly drift back to the tabletop .PERIOD but only when you feel the pressure 
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop .PERIOD keep your eyes closed ,COMMA 
Can you stand up 
Imagine a connection between you and him 
Point directly at his forehead ,COMMA 
Now i want you to be aware that in a moment ,COMMA when i snap my fingers ,COMMA your eyes will open again ,COMMA 
It's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle 
You see ,COMMA psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes 
Be careful ,COMMA because it is sharp just hold on to it for a moment .PERIOD 
And i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side 
There's five letters in the title 
There's a k in his name there is a k 
You knew 
No one in the audience and just to help you out ,COMMA i'll block them from view .PERIOD so nobody can see what you're doing 
But i don't want you to know either .PERIOD so swivel around on your chair 
Your right hand is that -- no ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok ,COMMA tell me when to stop 
Yes ,COMMA there's one 
Ok ?QUESTIONMARK do you think it's here ?QUESTIONMARK yes or no ,COMMA 
Neither oh ok ,COMMA 
We're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments 
After 10 years of experiments ,COMMA i found it 
It can't be that important 
Turns out it wasn't so easy 
And when it's produced ,COMMA it has a three-minute half-life ,COMMA and degrades rapidly at room temperature 
Then i had to measure morality 
So i started smaller 
So poor countries are by and large ,COMMA low trust countries 
So we recruit some people for an experiment 
We give them lots of instruction ,COMMA and we never ever deceive them .PERIOD 
So think about this experiment for minute 
But why 
Two things 
I didn't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness .PERIOD 
I used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .PERIOD 
These include massage ,COMMA dancing and praying .PERIOD 
In this book ,COMMA smith argued that we are moral creatures ,COMMA not because of a top-down reason ,COMMA but for a bottom-up reason 
So if i do something that hurts you ,COMMA i feel that pain 
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara ,COMMA california 
Tell that guy to wait half an hour 
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop .PERIOD and i was the pigeon 
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths .PERIOD 
One is through improper nurturing 
So we've studied sexually abused women and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus 
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin 
So i think it tells us that we've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple ,COMMA connect us ,COMMA emotionally 
So my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr .PERIOD love 
We have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier .PERIOD 
And they're happier ,COMMA because they have better relationships of all types .PERIOD 
I'll play at these rock shows be on stage standing completely still ,COMMA and they're like ,COMMA what's she doing .PERIOD what's she doing 
So basically ,COMMA with both of your hands ,COMMA you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes .PERIOD when really it's continuously going 
Maybe we'll go into the next tune because i totally lost where this is going 
It was invented around the 1920s ,COMMA and the inventor ,COMMA léon ,COMMA theremin -- he also was a musician ,COMMA besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin ,COMMA i think when he was working on some shortwave radios 
And then also you're trying to stay very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes ,COMMA if you're holding a low note -- -- and breathing will make it 
And it's meant to kind of reflect how we engage with histories ,COMMA or stories on the internet ,COMMA in a less linear form ,COMMA 
He was sent in 1907 to palestine .PERIOD by the zionist organization to look at areas for jewish settlement and acquire land for jewish settlement .PERIOD 
During the course of this trial ,COMMA all of the rabbits died ,COMMA except for a few ,COMMA which were euthanized .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when you look at a detail of this work ,COMMA you can see the man on the upper-left is the father of the woman sitting next to him 
During the time i was in bosnia the mortal remains of zumra's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave 
However ,COMMA the other individuals are represented by these blue slides ,COMMA which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals 
There's also parents who participated who wouldn't let their children participate ,COMMA because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves .PERIOD 
It was released in poland ,COMMA to create friction between frank and hitler so that hitler would imagine frank was trying to usurp his power .PERIOD 
Again talking about fate ,COMMA i was interested in the stories ,COMMA and fate of particular ,COMMA works of art .PERIOD 
Chapter 12 ,COMMA highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making ,COMMA but becomes their own 
I'm not quite sure whether i really want to see a snare drum at nine o'clock or so in the morning ,COMMA 
And it sounds quite simple .PERIOD but actually it's quite a big .PERIOD big job .PERIOD 
I will follow the instructions ?QUESTIONMARK the tempo markings ,COMMA the dynamics 
But here i'm being told that the piece of music is very quick 
Just the basic feeling 
We have to listen to ourselves ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA 
And i just feel at last one with the stick .PERIOD and one with the drum .PERIOD 
Not just translate them ,COMMA but interpret them 
Can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger ,COMMA there 
Every single one of us ,COMMA depending on where we're sitting will experience .PERIOD this sound quite quite differently .PERIOD 
Do you see what i mean .PERIOD so because of this explosion ,COMMA in access to sound ,COMMA especially through the deaf community ,COMMA this has not only affected ,COMMA how music institutions how schools for the deaf ,COMMA treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course ,COMMA being a participator of music ,COMMA that definitely is the case as well .PERIOD 
May be great there ,COMMA but terrible up there 
We just -- we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that that's what deafness is about 
In a year's time ,COMMA it could be two extra steps .PERIOD 
For me as a musician ,COMMA who deals with 99 percent of new music .PERIOD it's very easy for me to say .PERIOD oh ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i like that piece .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA i don't like that piece ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA 
And please try to create that through your clapping .PERIOD try just -- please try 
Very good snow .PERIOD snow have you ever heard snow 
Evelyn glennie .PERIOD well then stop clapping .PERIOD try again .PERIOD 
See you're awake 
However ,COMMA not one of you got out of your seats to think ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK how can i clap ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA maybe 
I may feel sorrowful ,COMMA or happy ,COMMA or exhilarated ,COMMA or angry ,COMMA when i play certain pieces of music ,COMMA but i'm not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .PERIOD 
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound ,COMMA because they're hearing the contact of the stick on the drum ,COMMA or the mallet on the bit of wood ,COMMA or the bow on the string ,COMMA etc .PERIOD or the breath that's creating the sound from wind ,COMMA and brass 
It's a video game move from star fox 
And we've gone from one board to 48 boards 
What the site's known for ,COMMA because it has this environment is it's fostered the creation of a lot of internet phenomena ,COMMA viral videos and whatnot ,COMMA known as memes 
And so there are three that i want to show you specifically 
It is where a third of all ,COMMA the traffic is going 
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the internet 
So we've got this activist group ,COMMA that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site .PERIOD 
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat 
We're sacrificing a lot of that ,COMMA and i think in doing so moving towards those things ,COMMA we're losing something valuable ,COMMA 
You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA you never know some of them -- we've got people in 75 countries out there watching 
Don't tell 
And saying ,COMMA whatever you like ,COMMA i think is powerful 
And the thing is ,COMMA i didn't make it into that presentation ,COMMA because i can't read to you anything that they said ,COMMA more or less 
Okay ,COMMA well 
You've got this surprising semi-underground influence ,COMMA but it's not making you a lot of money yet 
Yeah ,COMMA they still didn't know what to think of that ,COMMA though ,COMMA 
Within five 10 million years of the bolide impact .PERIOD we had a whole variety of animals going into the water .PERIOD why didn't they do that 
You want to measure it by diversity ,COMMA 
This slide was shown before this is the famous jurassic bird archaeopteryx .PERIOD 
If we could roll that first video clip 
But one with an immense chalkboard in the middle ,COMMA with lots of little areas of dinosaur rock .PERIOD if you could survive an expedition 
And the kinds of teams ,COMMA they bring in 
So you are finding yourself also in an amazing cultural milieu 
You're really rubbing shoulders with the world's last great nomadic .PERIOD people 
Here's the animal that was causing it trouble 
It is an incredible view of life .PERIOD and it really began when we began to understand the depth of time ,COMMA 
We prototyped by cat-scanning ,COMMA the brain out of this animal 
Now this field is just -- and of course ,COMMA science in general -- is just -- adventure 
Narrator ,COMMA if they can just land it this croc will provide useful data ,COMMA helping paul in his quest to understand sarcosuchus .PERIOD 
I've got it ,COMMA i've got the back legs 
Paul sereno ,COMMA let's get this tape measure on him ,COMMA put it right there 
Wow ,COMMA 
Anyway ,COMMA you find other things too .PERIOD 
These are all landlubbing animals .PERIOD there's a couple of choices 
And you take those four instances and you realize you have a complex problem 
They did it within two or three degrees of the pole to maintain similarity between continents 
Now we have divergence over time ,COMMA but we've created the third dimension of area 
I was a total failure in school ,COMMA not really headed to graduate high school 
What about all the kids like me that were in school -- kids like some of you out there -- that were in school and didn't get a chance and will never get a chance to participate in science and technology 
Because when you go out there as a scholar ,COMMA and you try to find out longitudinal studies ,COMMA track records like that ,COMMA there essentially are very few if none 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
And as a little girl ,COMMA i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful ,COMMA trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us ,COMMA enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy ,COMMA or two 
I almost lost it this week 
Leo ,COMMA this is cookie monster 
We looked at psychological involvement -- how much empathy did you feel for the other person .PERIOD 
We looked at their desire to cooperate ,COMMA 
Today we know that families are living further and further apart ,COMMA and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds .PERIOD over distance 
And as grandma-bot ,COMMA she can now play really play with my sons ,COMMA with her grandsons ,COMMA in the real world with his real toys .PERIOD 
Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface ,COMMA ran exactly the same dialogues 
The quality of advice was identical .PERIOD 
We've invited a lot of kids into this space ,COMMA and they think it's pretty cool .PERIOD 
That's her competition 
Paula radcliffe ,COMMA the one person ,COMMA who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of derartu tulu's under-underdog hands ,COMMA suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back 
They're not doing 26 miles ,COMMA they're doing 100 150 miles at a time ,COMMA and apparently without injury without problems 
And if you know it ,COMMA then you are smarter than anybody else on planet earth 
Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .PERIOD 
The only problem is ,COMMA the first edged weapons only appeared about 200000 years ago ,COMMA 
We're not fast 
Her uterus would be torn 
Then you go beyond 26 miles into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans -- remember pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles -- you get to 50 and 100 miles .PERIOD and suddenly it's a different game .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA emily baer -- 500 runners -- she finishes in eighth place ,COMMA in the top 10 ,COMMA even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race -- and yet beat 492 other people 
And you'll get slower and slower ,COMMA until eventually you're back to running the same speed .PERIOD you were at age 19 
Now ,COMMA i defy you to come up with any other physical activity -- and please don't say golf -- something that actually is hard -- where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers .PERIOD 
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal 
Well ,COMMA if that's true a couple other things had to be true as well ,COMMA 
The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word pack 
You need to have those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill ,COMMA and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved 
You can't be hauling all your crap around trying to chase the antelope 
He pissed me off ,COMMA let him go chase his own antelope .PERIOD 
Geronimo used to say that my only friends are my legs ,COMMA i only trust my legs .PERIOD 
That's because an apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles across the desert ,COMMA engage in hand-to-hand combat ,COMMA steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home 
I didn't do yoga .PERIOD i'm not ready 
So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from 
I show a number of photographs and films ,COMMA but i also make television programs books and some advertising ,COMMA all with the same concept ,COMMA 
I was fascinated by this phenomenon .PERIOD so i wondered ,COMMA could one erase the image of diana actually quite crudely and physically 
Momentum was being built 
I then went on wondering ,COMMA whether i could actually replace her image ,COMMA so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in or existed in the public imagination .PERIOD 
So this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband ,COMMA and this was a sequence of images 
All this imagery was creating a lot of fuss ,COMMA and i was cited as a disgusting artist .PERIOD the press were writing about this giving full pages about how terrible this was 
But then this changed suddenly 
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day ,COMMA and they were saying ,COMMA there's this great image of the queen sitting outside william hill .PERIOD 
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself 
And me as the queen 
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about marilyn -- the biggest icon of all -- and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth ,COMMA and only showing certain angles to create a reality that obviously is completely constructed .PERIOD 
I did an advertising campaign for schweppes ,COMMA which is coca-cola .PERIOD and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities .PERIOD 
Tony blair and cherie ,COMMA and again ,COMMA the legalities -- we had to be very careful 
And the press were interviewing ,COMMA and i was signing my book 
And in fact ,COMMA george bush .PERIOD and tony blair are having great fun during all of this 
So there was a lot of meaning in my life ,COMMA because i was performing this type of research during the day ,COMMA 
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place .PERIOD 
Our left hemisphere is all about the past ,COMMA and it's all about the future 
It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world 
I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you 
And i looked down at my body ,COMMA and i thought ,COMMA whoa ,COMMA i'm a weird-looking thing .PERIOD and it was ,COMMA as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality ,COMMA where i'm the person on the machine ,COMMA having the experience to some esoteric space where i'm witnessing myself having this experience .PERIOD 
I can't define where i begin ,COMMA and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall ,COMMA 
And then i would wait for what i call a wave of clarity ,COMMA 
And so i say to him -- clear in my mind ,COMMA i say to him .PERIOD this is jill ,COMMA i need help 
Nirvana i found nirvana .PERIOD and i remember thinking ,COMMA there's no way i would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body 
Two and a half weeks ,COMMA after the hemorrhage ,COMMA the surgeons went in ,COMMA and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers 
I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres ,COMMA the more peace ,COMMA we will project into the world ,COMMA and the more peaceful ,COMMA our planet will be 
In africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored 
No ,COMMA you will die .PERIOD 50 percent will die within 24 hours if not treated 
If you cannot secure the parents ,COMMA you cannot guarantee the security of the african child 
These are just for information ,COMMA hypertension ,COMMA diabetes ,COMMA obesity ,COMMA lack of exercise ,COMMA the usual suspects 
So they spend their money trying to fix those problems .PERIOD 
So for a radiopharmaceutical in the us -- that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we're finished manufacturing it in-house ,COMMA we come at a price of about two dollars 
This is at the heart institute .PERIOD the doctors from anywhere can log in 
They'll give me that information ,COMMA and we'll make the care of the patient better 
Because if you can't get it in nashville ,COMMA you can travel to birmingham ,COMMA two hours away ,COMMA and you'll get it if you can't get it in cleveland .PERIOD you can go to cincinnati .PERIOD we don't have that luxury .PERIOD so we have to make it happen 
So we emphasize training training is critical 
Sharon lazarus .PERIOD i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean since the past two years ,COMMA i received training at this institution .PERIOD 
I think i'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is 
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes ,COMMA because art and classes like that ,COMMA those are the classes where i excelled 
I thought everybody thought in pictures 
Ok ,COMMA there is my childhood church .PERIOD that's specific .PERIOD there's some more fort collins ?QUESTIONMARK 
But one of the things that really worries me is ,COMMA where's the younger version of those kids going today ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then there's a verbal mind .PERIOD they know ,COMMA every fact about everything 
And i came in half an hour beforehand so i could have it put on and kind of get used to it ,COMMA and they got it bent .PERIOD so it's not hitting my chin 
Because think about it ,COMMA an animal is a sensory-based thinker ,COMMA not verbal -- thinks in pictures ,COMMA thinks in sounds thinks in smells ,COMMA 
Are they friend or foe is there anybody ?QUESTIONMARK he can go mate with 
There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant 
Now ,COMMA this ability to put information into categories ,COMMA i find a lot of people are not very good at this 
I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that 
Is it a minor problem with something simple .PERIOD i can fix 
Yeah ,COMMA i'm a million-mile flyer .PERIOD 
I do lots and lots of flying .PERIOD and if i was at the faa ,COMMA what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of 
It would be their airplane tails 
I was a goofball student .PERIOD when i was in high school ,COMMA i just didn't care at all about studying until i had mr .PERIOD carlock's science class 
And they're not going down the right path 
But you know what i was getting work experience 
In other words ,COMMA use that fixation in order to motivate that kid ,COMMA that's one of the things we need to do 
The pattern thinkers ,COMMA they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians ,COMMA your software engineers ,COMMA your computer programmers ,COMMA all of those kinds of jobs 
Because the thing about being autistic is ,COMMA i had to learn social skills like being in a play 
I cannot emphasize enough ,COMMA what my science teacher did for me 
Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA you've got to look at age 
How many cattle got poked with the prodder ,COMMA 
Temple can i just say it's an absolute delight to have you at ted 
Okay ,COMMA 
Bye-bye 
When they were a bunch of kids ,COMMA they were kind of ,COMMA very imaginative ,COMMA very adventurous ,COMMA as they were trying at caltech to mix chemicals and see ,COMMA which one blows up more 
So that's what we call our first five employees during the tea break .PERIOD you know ,COMMA in here 
And that was done over a period of a couple of years .PERIOD and now we are the leading organization ,COMMA you know ,COMMA exploring space on all of your behalf 
But even when we did that we had to remind ourselves ,COMMA sometimes there are setbacks ,COMMA 
But then also just to celebrate that ,COMMA we started an event at jpl for miss guided missile 
Maybe they're right - i doubt it 
So next time you are really depressed ,COMMA look in the mirror ,COMMA and you can look and say ,COMMA hi ,COMMA i'm looking at a star here 
So it is a dynamic planet and activity is going on as we speak today ,COMMA 
As i told you ,COMMA geologists ,COMMA love craters ,COMMA 
If you were there ,COMMA you wouldn't do it yourself 
And that's what we found out it turned out that every once in a while ,COMMA there are dust devils which come by on mars ,COMMA as you are seeing here .PERIOD and when the dust devil comes over the rover it ,COMMA just cleans it up 
Yeah ,COMMA 
It's the first mission that's going to try to land near the north pole of mars .PERIOD and it's the first mission that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water on the surface of another planet .PERIOD 
The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the sun ,COMMA 
The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2600 degrees fahrenheit ,COMMA 
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart 
We kick them ,COMMA we hit them .PERIOD we drop them just to make sure we understand how where would they break 
And i know ,COMMA many of you kind of last time afterwards ,COMMA said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags 
It's real stuff 
So the idea is by watching saturn ,COMMA we're actually watching our solar system in real time ,COMMA being formed on a smaller scale .PERIOD so it's like a test bed for it .PERIOD 
Now you think that those rings are very large objects 
That was [unclear] also -- you know ,COMMA because we were worried about the risk of it ,COMMA but it worked pretty well 
So people believe now that titan is most likely what we call a pre-biotic planet ,COMMA because it's so cold ,COMMA organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material ,COMMA and therefore life could have evolved on it .PERIOD 
So here we have a cycle of a planet ,COMMA which is like our earth ,COMMA but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material 
And being the current day .PERIOD of course ,COMMA we started our own facebook group 
Now ,COMMA why am i telling you this story ?QUESTIONMARK and what does this have to do with the future of health 
What i'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies ,COMMA 
And coming up next month is actually future med a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .PERIOD 
These mobile phones have over 20000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there's one out of the uk ,COMMA 
Let's start with faster 
We can look inside with real time fmri -- in the brain at real time ,COMMA 
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte ,COMMA or 800000 ,COMMA books 
And now ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we're in the era of the ipad ,COMMA even the ipad .PERIOD 2 
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different 
Consumers now can buy basically hundred-dollar devices ,COMMA like this little fitbit .PERIOD 
So a few examples we're now in the era of fantastic voyage ,COMMA the ipill 
And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies ,COMMA and at the point of care ,COMMA 
My data indicates that i've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration ,COMMA a kind of blindness 
I'm at almost twice the risk for type ii diabetes ,COMMA 
It might change my behavior 
We can capture that information 
This has been called by lee ,COMMA hood ,COMMA the father of the field .PERIOD p4 medicine 
How about more targeted therapies for cancer ,COMMA 
Now i'll close with regenerative medicine 
Geron just last year started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries 
Still a phase i trial but evolving 
I thought i would read poems .PERIOD i have that relate to the subject of youth and age 
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ,COMMA half a long century gone .PERIOD and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar 
It's a longer poem 
It's called the neighbor 
Her shadow once fumbling the chain on her door ,COMMA then the door slamming fearfully shut ,COMMA only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does day and night into the hall 
My thinking we'd meet recognize one another become friends that i'd accomplish a penance .PERIOD 
Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell .PERIOD 
Medea she was next time .PERIOD i saw her 
My holding the door

The dance of our glances ,COMMA the clash ,COMMA pulling each other through our perceptual punctures ,COMMA then holocaust ,COMMA holocaust ,COMMA host on host of ill ,COMMA injured presences ,COMMA squandered ,COMMA consumed 
The dance of our glances ,COMMA challenge ,COMMA abdication ,COMMA effacement ,COMMA the perfume of our consternation .PERIOD 
Forever with grace 
But i'm afraid that ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me .PERIOD 
Special ,COMMA big tits says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand 
But forget her breasts 
The display was a photo ,COMMA men and women stripped naked .PERIOD some trying to cover their genitals ,COMMA others too frightened to bother ,COMMA lined up in snow ,COMMA waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch 
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them 
The truth is that we know that the images themselves ,COMMA don't change the world ,COMMA but we're also aware that since the beginning of photography ,COMMA images have provoked reactions in people ,COMMA and those reactions have caused change to happen .PERIOD 
It changed our view of the physical world 
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in iraq than virtually any other single act .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA these images became the voices of protest themselves .PERIOD 
I was the only human being in an area one-and-a-half times the size of america ,COMMA five-and-a-half thousand square miles .PERIOD 
Ben i've read somewhere that at minus 40 ,COMMA exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute .PERIOD so how do you answer the call of nature ?QUESTIONMARK 
Third one ?QUESTIONMARK how do you top that ?QUESTIONMARK what's next 
I was 23 years old .PERIOD no one ,COMMA my age had attempted anything like this ,COMMA and pretty quickly almost everything that could have gone wrong .PERIOD did go wrong .PERIOD 
I had frostbite in my left big toe .PERIOD 
You can just see -- there's a nine and a string of zeros here .PERIOD 
I dialed three numbers .PERIOD i dialed my mum .PERIOD

There are huge areas of open water ,COMMA just south of your position 
Antarctica ,COMMA if you include the ice shelves ,COMMA is twice the size of australia -- it's a big place .PERIOD 
And they turned around headed back to the coast ,COMMA and all five of them died on the return journey .PERIOD 
Where was this guilt trip coming from 
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly 
And he pulled the whole mean down destroying my statistical significance of the test 
So i looked carefully at this guy 
And i'm sure that it's something that we all recognize ,COMMA and we see that it happens 
And that's a much much more difficult lesson to take into account 
In my mind ,COMMA i was actually a knight trying to help science move along 
I mean ,COMMA this is all very depressing ,COMMA right -- people have conflicts of interest .PERIOD we don't see it .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of hiv for 15 years ,COMMA worked on four continents ,COMMA and you're looking at her 
And so everyone lined up ,COMMA all the smackheads in a row ,COMMA and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit ,COMMA and he went down and started injecting people 
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high 
So ,COMMA what's that about is it like you get a better high ?QUESTIONMARK if you share or something 
So she was making a politically rational decision 
I've always been a bit curious about that ,COMMA because i think stigma is a bad thing .PERIOD whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing .PERIOD but we'll leave that be 
Of course ,COMMA you can't get hiv just by having unprotected sex 
And again ,COMMA it's because of an alignment of the incentives 
And actually clients don't want to go home with a drip either 
He's from haiti ,COMMA and he has aids 
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids ,COMMA and rightly so ,COMMA 
We've got the tools ,COMMA the knowledge and the cash and commitment to preventing hiv ,COMMA too 
There are as many different ways of being rational ,COMMA as there are human beings on the planet ,COMMA and that's one of the glories of human existence .PERIOD 
Ten years ago exactly i was in afghanistan 
Would you like to see civil ,COMMA war ,COMMA sectarian killing 
They found something called facebook 
This is what they were telling .PERIOD this is their propaganda 
And this is how the revolution was born in tunisia .PERIOD 
But we found that these people in the street ,COMMA all of them are our reporters ,COMMA feeding our newsroom with pictures ,COMMA with videos ,COMMA and with news 
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people 
Be aware of these people who [are] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization .PERIOD 
They have been detached from their people from the masses .PERIOD and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other 
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom ,COMMA and to tell them make your best not to switch off the cameras at night .PERIOD because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well 
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world ,COMMA 
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the west -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest ,COMMA or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security 
Is this a story-of-the-year ,COMMA a story-of-the-decade or something more 
In my opinion ,COMMA these people are much more wiser than not only the political elite ,COMMA even the intellectual elite ,COMMA even opposition leaders including political parties .PERIOD 
Thank you so much

It was hard on the cats ,COMMA but it made a great little instrument 
And if you don't know what you're doing your hands are bleeding in no time .PERIOD 
Good news :COLON chariot's coming .PERIOD 
And i don't want it to leave me behind 
Now ,COMMA my mother hoped that we learned from that ,COMMA the value of hard work 
No ,COMMA we learned something else 
The first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again ,COMMA 
But that day in the cotton field out there picking ,COMMA when those people started singing ,COMMA i realized i was in the very heart of real music .PERIOD and that's where i've wanted to be ever since 
Good news :COLON chariot's coming .PERIOD 
It was a few years ago ,COMMA but i sort of remembered this story ,COMMA and i told it at a concert 
My mom was in the audience 
I just wanted ,COMMA you boys to learn the value of hard work 
And i don't want it to leave me behind 
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues .PERIOD 
They were about my age 
It had three chemicals .PERIOD we were really surprised to see :COLON sulfur :COLON potassium nitrate and charcoal .PERIOD 
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard ,COMMA 
We have about 120 million dollars ,COMMA and we want to do it .PERIOD well ,COMMA 
The first thing that anybody who knows science and has been around science is that the stuff you learn in school .PERIOD as a scientific method is wrong .PERIOD there is no method 
I’m not going to read them all to you ,COMMA because i’m not in teacher mode .PERIOD 
And i want to talk about three stages in that evolution 
In that year ,COMMA we are not available for any of our clients 
We are totally closed 
Quite the similar idea ,COMMA then a perfume packaged in a book in a die .PERIOD cut 
I likely already look forward to the weekend on thursdays .PERIOD 
Europe and the us didn't really feel enticing ,COMMA because i knew them too well .PERIOD so asia ,COMMA it was 
So i looked for furniture 
So one of the things that we pursued in bali was pieces of furniture 
And i think ,COMMA by the time ,COMMA this lamp came about .PERIOD i had finally made peace with those dogs 
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in bali 
His latest numbers are fairly impressive .PERIOD 
So i became my own intern 
I had fun 
Financially seen over the long term ,COMMA it was actually successful 
We were asked to design an identity for casa da musica the rem koolhaas-built ,COMMA music center in porto ,COMMA in portugal 
It has a more transparent identity 
Some of you might have seen it 
So after eight hours ,COMMA that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .PERIOD 
So i'll just give you my message up .PERIOD front try not to go extinct 
People ask me a lot -- in fact ,COMMA one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like dinosaurs so much 
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had 
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs 
And they thought about it ,COMMA and they even wrote papers about it ,COMMA where are the little dinosaurs 
First off ,COMMA scientists have egos and scientists like to name dinosaurs 
So this is where people went astray again ,COMMA 
But i have a museum ,COMMA and i collect dinosaurs ,COMMA and i can saw mine open 
And if you cut into an older dinosaur ,COMMA it's very massive 
So ,COMMA here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head ,COMMA no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD 
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of ,COMMA looked alike 
Dracorex is the littlest one ?QUESTIONMARK stygimoloch is the middle size one .PERIOD pachycephalosaurus is the largest one 
But it didn't give them a clue 
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum ,COMMA 
And then as they grow older ,COMMA the horns grow forward 
If you look along the edge of the frill ,COMMA they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles ,COMMA and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD 
And we get rid of anatotitan .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA real easy to say that tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus .PERIOD and therefore we can take out another dinosaur 
Now as you can imagine ,COMMA this is not very popular with fourth-graders 
This is soft sell for 42nd street 
They weren't doing their primary work ,COMMA which was for the government ,COMMA while they were helping us with this 
And many musicians ,COMMA choose to use the theater glass walls totally open 
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small-scale performances .PERIOD they asked us to bring an intimacy 
And this is a mockup that is in salt lake city ,COMMA that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale 
Chris has been so nice 
So nice all week ,COMMA he's the kind of man you could say to chris .PERIOD i'm really sorry ,COMMA i've crashed .PERIOD your car 
And you know that chris would say thank you 
Emmanuel ,COMMA absolutely 
So that's going to look pretty shabby now ,COMMA 
So what i thought i'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is what i can do is to launch today .PERIOD the first ted global auction 
And he'll say you're offering me things that are infinitely variable 
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link ,COMMA 
This man has swum around the north pole .PERIOD what more evidence do you want 
No 
Alright ,COMMA it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain' .PERIOD you know ,COMMA i wrote to him ,COMMA just before i left office .PERIOD i said ,COMMA 'can i rely on your support for the next month' .PERIOD and he wrote back ,COMMA he said ,COMMA 'no ,COMMA you can't' ,COMMA which kind of surprised me because i'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before .PERIOD 
When you think what's happened to financial services ,COMMA and you see what's happened to the economy ,COMMA you think ,COMMA well ,COMMA there is a man who delivers on his promises 
And you know iceland ,COMMA it was never going to cut it 
Luckily ,COMMA somebody like george bush was really helpful 
He summed it up ,COMMA really at a dinner 
And then you're now .PERIOD well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that's what this is about 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i'm sorry about that 
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
So he comes over to this country ,COMMA and he says ,COMMA we need a big fiscal stimulus 
He goes to prague ,COMMA he says ,COMMA we believe in a nuclear-free world .PERIOD 
Do you remember that george bush ,COMMA a nu-ca-ler .PERIOD 
Who said ,COMMA reach out and touch 
So nelson ,COMMA how would you like a nice water feature 
And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person ,COMMA 
And it has close to 1200 such plants for 300 occupants 
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen going up by one percent .PERIOD if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours ,COMMA 
And the study showed that compared to other buildings ,COMMA there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent ,COMMA respiratory systems by 34 percent ,COMMA headaches by 24 percent ,COMMA lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent 
Why is this important 
So ,COMMA how do you feel about that -- the whole -- ma ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it's pretty irritating actually ,COMMA because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing 
And no guy ever gets criticized ,COMMA but that's the least of it 
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world ,COMMA and also how you felt about yourself as a mother ,COMMA a grandmother ,COMMA nurturing 
And so how did you handle that 
Because in her lifetime -- ma ,COMMA that would be so 
Thank you for joining us today ,COMMA 
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from dna 
And if you buy all of this ,COMMA and you think life is about computation as i do ,COMMA then you look at big questions ,COMMA through the eyes of a computer scientist 
This is exactly analogous to the question .PERIOD what's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word 
And just as he's writing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bacteria that will be smaller .PERIOD he's writing genomes that will work .PERIOD we could write smaller programs that would do what microsoft word does .PERIOD 
Now these are big questions in computer science 
That holds the long strand like this 
I wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye ,COMMA down the nose up the nose ,COMMA around the forehead ,COMMA back down and end in a little loop like this 
It's got a needle like a record needle that goes back and forth over the surface bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface 
She wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami ,COMMA a beautiful rendition of china ,COMMA which even has taiwan .PERIOD and you can see ,COMMA it's sort of on the world's shortest leash ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is just a single switch ,COMMA and you need half a billion for a computer .PERIOD so we have a long way to go 
The dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works 
The fact is that it does not scale 
So now we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise 
You can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation ,COMMA and you'll get 96 rather than 32 
Here is a dna origami rectangle .PERIOD and here are some tiles growing from it 
So it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago ,COMMA and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things .PERIOD so i think we made a lot of progress 
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors 
What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light .PERIOD asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
Therefore it would be too risky to release these animals ,COMMA both for the released ,COMMA and for the natural populations ,COMMA 
So this is not new people have been doing this around the world 
So these genes are indeed ,COMMA going back to the populations 
So i say ,COMMA let's study more ,COMMA let's shed light on this issue .PERIOD let's do whatever we can 
This song kind of came out of all of that 
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims .PERIOD saving life .PERIOD 
And the other is moksha-yug access ,COMMA which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i'm exploring 
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .PERIOD 
Now let me ask you another question 
But you also don't have the time resources ,COMMA expertise or wherewithal to fight .PERIOD this 
Like a bribe buster service ,COMMA or 1-800-fight-bribes ,COMMA or wwwstopbribesorg or wwwpreventcorruptionorg ,COMMA 
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more 
A set of people actually say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA let me just grant it to them and run away from it 
But the one thing i want you to notice about them is this ,COMMA even though this is a very long list .PERIOD there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings ,COMMA 
And yet ,COMMA when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were ,COMMA like ,COMMA they encountered mike ,COMMA who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because mr .PERIOD jones was out of his bed ,COMMA getting a little exercise trying to build up his strength ,COMMA walking slowly ,COMMA up and down the hall 
And then there was luke who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice .PERIOD because the man's father who had been keeping a vigil for six months ,COMMA didn't see ,COMMA luke ,COMMA do it the first time and his father was angry .PERIOD 
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule ,COMMA as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives 
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page ,COMMA but dancing around them ,COMMA inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation .PERIOD and the people at hand 
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims 
Dad being an academic had no idea that mike's hard lemonade contained alcohol .PERIOD 
And they were ready to let the kid go 
When things go wrong .PERIOD as of course they do we reach for two tools to try to fix them .PERIOD 
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book .PERIOD 
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster .PERIOD 
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page .PERIOD 
We need more rules for the bankers ,COMMA god knows 
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed 
They said ,COMMA if we paid you six weeks' salary every year ,COMMA would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community 
We see this in medicine ,COMMA 
I don't know how many of you remember this another moral hero .PERIOD 15 years ago ,COMMA aaron feuerstein ,COMMA who was the head of malden mills in massachusetts -- they made polartec -- the factory burned down ,COMMA 
And a bonus he's discovering is he's actually going to make even more money 
In many ways ,COMMA this is the perfect example 
So there's a lot here at ted ,COMMA and at other places to celebrate 
There are ordinary heroes 
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work 
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom .PERIOD 
I think there is reason for hope 
Thank you 
A few years ago ,COMMA i was visited by the guy that runs darpa .PERIOD the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities ,COMMA probably wouldn't take the risk of doing 
Now ,COMMA we've got f18s and f22s .PERIOD and if somebody loses an arm ,COMMA we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it .PERIOD 
If it's the raisin ,COMMA they won't drop it .PERIOD 
I told them they're nuts .PERIOD 
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful 
I went back ,COMMA and i started putting a team together .PERIOD the best guys i could find with a passion to do this 
We walked into walter reed ,COMMA and i could not have been more wrong 
I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears ,COMMA or i can give you power .PERIOD i can't give you both 
I lost my right arm ,COMMA but i'm a lefty .PERIOD 
So we went back 
So we went back and we've been working harder yet ,COMMA 
And he was there ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we needed to come 
He's got no arms 
Who is going to pay for it 
Those are tough questions 
I don't know the answers 
What do we need to do ?QUESTIONMARK there's very polarized answers to that question too ,COMMA and i don't have any answers to that 
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary 
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be 
And we ought to give it to them 
That one was way more difficult than i had expected 
When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him ,COMMA and there was no brain damage .PERIOD 
So i took that as a challenge ,COMMA basically ,COMMA 
And i stayed inside of that water tank ,COMMA hoping my core temperature would start to drop 
So i realized that was completely not going to work 
So i went to talk to a doctor friend ,COMMA and i asked him ,COMMA how could i do that 
Then i actually started thinking about liquid ,COMMA breathing 
You blow in and out 
And you're really ridding your body of co2 
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person 
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months 
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value .PERIOD 
And i started to really adapt my body 
I assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center .PERIOD and if i stayed there a week ,COMMA not eating ,COMMA i would get comfortable in that situation ,COMMA and i would slow my metabolism ,COMMA which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it 
And i thought everything seemed to be on track 
And by seven minutes ,COMMA i had gone into these awful convulsions .PERIOD 
This was a different record .PERIOD this was a pure o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes .PERIOD 
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15000 feet .PERIOD 
But for tv ,COMMA they wanted me to be upright ,COMMA so they could see my face .PERIOD basically ,COMMA 
That made me extremely nervous raising the heart rate 
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down 
And i started having ischemia to the heart ,COMMA 
My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50 to 150 to 40 to 20 to 150 again ,COMMA 
So i let my feet out ,COMMA and i started floating to the top 
They had doctors with the pst ,COMMA you know ,COMMA so sitting there waiting 
As a magician ,COMMA i try to show things to people that seem impossible 
And then he stopped walking in front of him was her 
Sure she had aged a little 
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him ,COMMA because she was a keen amateur pornographer .PERIOD 
And that provides the ground for a type of action ,COMMA because consensus of each moment ,COMMA allows us to act 
We have three critical terms economy ,COMMA civil society and the state 
We propose 10 
The least important form of capital in this project is financial capital -- money 
Now the issue that should concern us here -- and that's the challenge that i would like to pose to this group -- is ,COMMA again ,COMMA it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a bs degree ,COMMA 
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down 
So when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan ,COMMA it's because of that legacy 
Look ,COMMA there's a very little known fact countries that have a legal ,COMMA average income per capita of 1000 dollars .PERIOD don't produce drugs .PERIOD 
Cotton does not compete with opium .PERIOD a t-shirt does 
I'm all for it .PERIOD after all ,COMMA i raised a lot of it 
And then i'll let you in on a secret ,COMMA which is why i am an incurable optimist .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps 
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society ,COMMA who are the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism .PERIOD 
It will cause rising seas .PERIOD it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands 
For some it will lead to anger ,COMMA religious and sectarian violence and terrorism .PERIOD 
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for .PERIOD and it could be 10 times that 
Enough of the bad news ,COMMA human beings have always risen to the challenge 
20 years ago ,COMMA there were three and a half million 
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
All throughout the technology world ,COMMA we're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome .PERIOD 
More reasons to be optimistic in the '60s ,COMMA and i am a creature of the '60s .PERIOD there was a movement 
And on july 7th ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA i learned only yesterday .PERIOD there will be global live earth concerts 
Now that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest ,COMMA the most 
We visited every house in india ,COMMA searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses once every month for nearly two years 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
In the history of our planet ,COMMA there have been three great waves of evolution 
But we had to do it ,COMMA the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way ,COMMA and then breeding them 
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards ,COMMA 
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid ,COMMA created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama 
They did it with puppies ,COMMA 
And so some states have decided to allow them .PERIOD some states have decided to ban them 
And before you get too worried about it here in the united states ,COMMA the majority of food ,COMMA you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it 
This is prometea ,COMMA the first cloned horse 
These were the first cloned calves ,COMMA the first cloned grey wolves .PERIOD and then finally ,COMMA the first cloned piglets :COLON alexis chista ,COMMA carrel ,COMMA janie and dotcom 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species 
And now ,COMMA using a joystick ,COMMA they can send this creature around the lab and control ,COMMA whether it goes left or right ,COMMA forwards ,COMMA or backwards .PERIOD 
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal 
And he used that ,COMMA as the it piece of a mechanism ,COMMA which ran a flight simulator ,COMMA 
I don't know ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding 
This is a mouse .PERIOD created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts ,COMMA 
This is what frankenstein's lab looks like 
We are not only already using these things in animals ,COMMA some of them we're already beginning to use on our own bodies .PERIOD 
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents 
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book on the origin of species ,COMMA published 150 years ago ,COMMA 
Now ,COMMA what is so interesting ?QUESTIONMARK and to some the extent ,COMMA what's a bit infamous about the origin of species is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .PERIOD 
If only darwin had nasa 
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation ,COMMA 
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution .PERIOD 
So living at the equator ,COMMA we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful ,COMMA complex ,COMMA ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen .PERIOD 
Major moves outside of our equatorial homeland ,COMMA from africa ,COMMA into other parts of the old world ,COMMA and most recently into the new world 
But it's all uva .PERIOD and significantly that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin 
Humans have been on the move for a long time ,COMMA 
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people ,COMMA voluntary movements in the last 5000 years 
And not all these moves were voluntary 
Evolution helps us 
But we need to think about how he compares ,COMMA in terms of his pigmentation ,COMMA to other people on earth ,COMMA 
They also run the risk of vitamin d deficiency ,COMMA if they have desk jobs ,COMMA like that guy ,COMMA 
Darwin ,COMMA i think would have appreciated this ,COMMA even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life ,COMMA 
Well ,COMMA the topic i'm going to discuss is one ,COMMA which is in a certain sense ,COMMA very peculiar ,COMMA because it's very old 
Now ,COMMA why do i show a cauliflower ?QUESTIONMARK a very ordinary and ancient vegetable 
If you try to weigh it -- of course ,COMMA it's very easy to weigh it ,COMMA and when you eat it ,COMMA the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface 
If you cut with a sharp knife ,COMMA one of the florets of a cauliflower .PERIOD and look at it separately ,COMMA you think of a whole cauliflower .PERIOD but smaller 
Now ,COMMA what did humanity do with that 
Well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA it's good in many ways .PERIOD 
It used to be very time-consuming ,COMMA but now it's nothing 
Anatomists were arguing very much about that 
This cloud is completely 100 percent artificial 
And the only part ,COMMA which is natural is a number ,COMMA the roughness of the cloud ,COMMA which is taken from nature 
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent ,COMMA which was absolutely amazing .PERIOD that man can invent things that nature did not know .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane 
I read the book that mr .PERIOD eiffel wrote about his tower .PERIOD and indeed it was astonishing .PERIOD how much he understood 
Then i was telling my assistant ,COMMA i don't see anything can you paint it 
It was very easy ,COMMA and you can write many books very fast about it 
In a way ,COMMA it's the story of my life 
If you could find something new anything ,COMMA you will get your career made 
It's so complicated 
Obviously from extraterrestrials 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
In 1984 in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity .PERIOD nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth ,COMMA ethiopia 
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north ,COMMA people could not access or entitle themselves to that food .PERIOD 
Most africans today ,COMMA by far are farmers 
It also has very high cost implications 
Speaking of risk we have seen that price volatility of food crops in africa is the highest in the world 
In the american ,COMMA midwest ,COMMA farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the chicago market 
What's really important is that the ecx will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country ,COMMA using vsat technology ,COMMA to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers ,COMMA 
And they come to the market ,COMMA knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium 
We believe that the winds of change are here ,COMMA and that we can do it 
We believe that the stakes are high ,COMMA but that the returns will be even greater 
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than south africa's grain production .PERIOD and in fact ,COMMA ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in africa .PERIOD 
It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen and present my proposal to build a 6000-kilometer-long wall across the entire african continent .PERIOD 
The threat is desertification 
It is always the same .PERIOD never the same endlessly fascinating 
One billion grains of sand ,COMMA come into existence in the world .PERIOD each second ,COMMA 
Just south of the sahara we find the sahel 
Now ,COMMA there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down 
Inside of the dunes ,COMMA we find shade 
Here i am playing the part of the mad scientist working with the bugs at ucl in london ,COMMA trying to solidify them 
Well ,COMMA i was inspired for my architectural form ,COMMA by tafoni ,COMMA which look a little bit like this .PERIOD this is a model representation of it ,COMMA 
These are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto 
That's not true at all 
So there it is -- architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself .PERIOD 
My design ,COMMA as it takes you down the rabbit hole ,COMMA is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world .PERIOD 
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd is effectively a civilization starter kit ,COMMA 
He was talking about the space aliens ,COMMA 
I have never built an atomic pile 
Think about it 
I was pretty good at the video games .PERIOD i was not very good at the other part .PERIOD so i stayed alone with the cosmos 
Now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans ,COMMA 
I went with my friend .PERIOD tim mcgonigal who sat on my left 
I remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle ,COMMA an ace bandage and she had crutches 
I was starting high school at the time ,COMMA i would say she was a junior ,COMMA but i had never seen her before .PERIOD she didn't go to my school 
I mean ,COMMA i liked him a lot better than the sandworms 
Except for the girl 
And the way i remember it ,COMMA the movie featured these details 
But i was exhausted and dog-bitten .PERIOD and so i said ,COMMA no 
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes ,COMMA either catherine would come back to the hotel ,COMMA or she would never come back to the hotel 
But he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me 
I mean ,COMMA somebody pays you to go around and travel ,COMMA and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet 
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod ,COMMA 
It's a little hard to understand that because you can go to a costco in the united states and buy cheap fish 
The trophy fish were so big that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it 
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little tiny fish 
You can see the rows in the bottom ,COMMA the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn 
It was when i was on holiday last early autumn ,COMMA in france ,COMMA 
This is from the coast of brittany ,COMMA which is being enveloped in this green ,COMMA algal slime 
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously ,COMMA 
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries ,COMMA of the sardines of california or in peru ,COMMA or whatever those slow down and those fisheries collapse 
Now i haven't got anything against efficiency 
In the world i describe to you ,COMMA we have to be right over here at the right-hand side ,COMMA at six grams of carbon 
So i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics ,COMMA 
So it looks a little bit like this 
That's called the circular flow of the economy .PERIOD 
They want to hunker down ,COMMA they want to look to the future 
Are we these novelty-seeking ,COMMA hedonistic ,COMMA selfish individuals 
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human ,COMMA recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt's fragile ,COMMA altruist within 
And we're going to do it 
We're just going to click on naturejobsuk 
And this too requires investment ,COMMA investment -- for example ,COMMA in places -- places where we can connect places where we can participate ,COMMA shared spaces ,COMMA concert halls ,COMMA gardens ,COMMA public parks ,COMMA libraries ,COMMA museums ,COMMA quiet centers ,COMMA places of joy and celebration ,COMMA places of tranquility and contemplation ,COMMA sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship in michael .PERIOD sandel's ,COMMA lovely phrase .PERIOD 
Chris anderson :COLON while they're taking the podium away .PERIOD just a quick question .PERIOD 
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing 
But it has to have political leadership 
The napalm is burning there quite nicely 
Oil doesn't sink .PERIOD it floats 
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment .PERIOD it hits the water 
It triples the amount of oily ,COMMA messy goo that you have in the water ,COMMA and it makes it very hard to handle 
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics ,COMMA it's absolutely explosive 
They have a eureka moment ,COMMA when we suddenly understand oil in a different context ,COMMA 
You might notice that many gas pumps ,COMMA including this one are designed to look like atms .PERIOD 
Early journalists looked at these spills ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA this is a filthy industry 
And the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild-east of oil industry ,COMMA and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company ,COMMA a multinational 
And then there's this guy .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing 
They really influence people 
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period 
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms 
And these guys ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA if they were in the us ,COMMA they might be actually here in this room 
And then the guy in the exxon uniform stepped out ,COMMA and we realized it was okay ,COMMA 
So what i'm going to talk to you about now is what do we have to do this time ?QUESTIONMARK 
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel .PERIOD and these molecules 
Cynthia schneider ,COMMA these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society .PERIOD 
People become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA who fan out over the countryside ,COMMA campaigning for their candidate 
One of them lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar ,COMMA a very conservative part of the country 
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value .PERIOD 
And then a thought came across my mind .PERIOD if things go pear-shaped on this swim ,COMMA how long will it take for my frozen body to sink ,COMMA the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean 
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water ,COMMA from the himalayas ,COMMA 
I carried on for another five or six strokes ,COMMA and then i had nothing in my body .PERIOD and i went down to the bottom of the lake 
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have 
And there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt .PERIOD everest ,COMMA 
Take some time to rest and think about things 
I say i do hardware because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do 
So this talk is going to be about ,COMMA how do we make things ?QUESTIONMARK and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future 
And i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues ,COMMA i have and said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA well ,COMMA if i have to talk about the future ,COMMA what is it 
Literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program ,COMMA 
And this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology ,COMMA 
Took me six years at mit and about that many pages to describe what i was doing .PERIOD and it took him one page .PERIOD and so this is our muse tucker 
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins 
These are little mechanical computers 
These are five-state state machines 
In a neutral state ,COMMA they won't bind at all .PERIOD 
So now i'm going to show you the hands-free ,COMMA autonomous self-replication .PERIOD 
So neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday ,COMMA i believe ,COMMA but i'll show you again 
And how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary ,COMMA condition ,COMMA 
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species 
And the correlation ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn't really all that difficult to figure out .PERIOD if you think about it 
And we're basically using mobility to get the access .PERIOD we need 
And it is possible ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to increase the density of the communities around us 
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air ,COMMA in the process of using our cities .PERIOD 
Because right now our economy by and large operates as paul .PERIOD hawken said by stealing the future ,COMMA selling it in the present ,COMMA and calling it gdp .PERIOD 
President clinton if you're here .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA why has violence declined ?QUESTIONMARK no one really knows .PERIOD but i have read four explanations ,COMMA all of which i think have some grain of plausibility .PERIOD the first is ,COMMA maybe thomas hobbes ,COMMA got it ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was solitary ,COMMA poor ,COMMA nasty ,COMMA brutish and short ,COMMA not because he argued ,COMMA humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative ,COMMA but because of the logic of anarchy ,COMMA in a state of anarchy .PERIOD there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively ,COMMA before they invade ,COMMA you more .PERIOD recently ,COMMA thomas schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement being a good american .PERIOD he has a pistol in the nightstand ,COMMA pulls out his gun ,COMMA and walks down the stairs .PERIOD 
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible ,COMMA and therefore ,COMMA it would lead to a state of peace eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in europe coincided with the rise of centralized states .PERIOD 
This was an argument from the political scientist ,COMMA james payne 
Because we have been doing something right ,COMMA and it sure would be good to find out what it is 
We learned it in college 
We have liberia ,COMMA we have congo 
Income per person ,COMMA i can put that here 
That's why we are so scared about flu .PERIOD isn't it 
And especially ,COMMA it's interesting to see china and the united states during 200 years ,COMMA because i have my oldest son now working for google after google ,COMMA acquired this software 
Mao tse-tung eventually brought health to china ,COMMA and then he died .PERIOD and then deng xiaoping started ,COMMA this amazing move forward 
And i come now into projections ,COMMA but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because -- that's where the projections are ,COMMA not valid any longer 
East europe ,COMMA latin america .PERIOD and oecd countries 
It's lincoln here advancing them 
And we have countries all this way .PERIOD 
And what has happened in the world 
We used to boast about fast social progress ,COMMA 
That's where we were 1900 
And you can see ,COMMA it's not that easy that it is war ,COMMA which caused this 
And here in zambia ,COMMA there is peace .PERIOD 
If i split tanzania in its income ,COMMA the richer 20 percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one 
And it's really different within each country

We have seen it here in mozambique 
That used to be the illegal diamond trade from the unita-dominated area .PERIOD in angola ,COMMA 
Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies ,COMMA and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries 
I am a reformed marketer ,COMMA and i now work in international development 
He said ,COMMA there's just not in demand 
And as a marketer ,COMMA i found that curious

They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv ,COMMA put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .PERIOD 
And so the lesson is this ,COMMA it doesn't really matter what you're selling .PERIOD you just have to think about ,COMMA who is your customer ,COMMA and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior 
It was before the avian flu had reached europe 
I'll see what i can do .PERIOD ok ,COMMA 
Generations go by somebody says ,COMMA hey ,COMMA why don't we put it on a stick ?QUESTIONMARK 
Just absolutely delights the little ones 
Point is ,COMMA there's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds .PERIOD 
A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics ,COMMA and so on in everyday life ,COMMA often leads to cooperation .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way ,COMMA because when you think of non-zero ,COMMA you think win-win ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's good .PERIOD well ,COMMA there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat ,COMMA 
I have a whole global governance sermon that i will spare you right now ,COMMA because i don't think that's going to be enough .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA although it's essential 
That is to say -- -- thank you .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD that is to say ,COMMA remember ,COMMA my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self-interest 
Doing the best i can ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
It was kind of along these lines ,COMMA and the allegation was that i have ,COMMA quote ,COMMA affection for terrorists 
And a kind of saving higher moral level ,COMMA something that kind of literally saves the world 
Yahweh is our savior means ,COMMA he has saved the nation of israel ,COMMA which at the time was a pretty high-level social organization 
I am very ,COMMA very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they're reflecting on my glasses .PERIOD 
Because despair ,COMMA civil war hunger and famine ,COMMA although they're part and parcel of our african reality ,COMMA they are not the only reality 
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship ,COMMA 
Support private investment in africa ,COMMA both domestic and foreign 
Which country is that 
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy .PERIOD it lies with international donors .PERIOD 
The imf ,COMMA the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens ,COMMA and therefore what our governments are doing ,COMMA because they depend on aid is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens 
They talk to international donors 
Where has all the aid gone 
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent ,COMMA what do i mean 
The editor of discover told us 10 of them .PERIOD i'm going to give you the eleventh 
So they came to me -- cnn -- and they said ,COMMA professor seligman ,COMMA would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look .PERIOD doctor seligman ,COMMA we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium 
Not good enough ,COMMA and that's what i'm going to be talking about 
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage 
And starting about six years ago ,COMMA we asked about extremely happy .PERIOD people 
That's what aristotle was talking about 
The first life is the pleasant life ,COMMA and it's simply as best we can find it .PERIOD it's having as many of the pleasures as you can as much positive emotion ,COMMA as you can and learning the skills -- savoring ,COMMA mindfulness -- that amplify them ,COMMA that stretch them over time and space .PERIOD 
In two of the three great arenas of life .PERIOD by the time ,COMMA len was 30 ,COMMA len was enormously successful ,COMMA the first arena was work .PERIOD 
It turned out that -- len grew up in long island ,COMMA and he played football and watched football ,COMMA and played bridge -- len is in the bottom ,COMMA five percent of what we call positive affectivities .PERIOD 
When he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 930 in the morning ,COMMA time stops for him ,COMMA and it stops till the closing bell ,COMMA 
And we think there's a recipe for it ,COMMA and it's knowing what your highest strengths are ,COMMA 
Just one example ,COMMA one person .PERIOD i worked with was a bagger at genuardi's 
Her highest strength was social intelligence ,COMMA so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day 
Now obviously she failed 
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness 
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction ,COMMA and who you never properly thanked 
I hope all of you have such a person 
But they were empty 
And so the parallel thing holds with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design .PERIOD i believe 
So in conclusion ,COMMA the eleventh reason for optimism .PERIOD in addition to the space elevator is that i think with technology ,COMMA entertainment and design .PERIOD we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet 
And if technology can in the next decade or two increase the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life and the meaningful life ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD 
Here's an example 
Four years ago ,COMMA i was at the beach with my son ,COMMA and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches .PERIOD 
So this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists ,COMMA working at the very top of their craft -- except one 
But to be a great photojournalist ,COMMA you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you 
But the centerpiece species of zakouma ,COMMA are the elephants 
And instead created a story that touched our audiences ,COMMA deeply 
Instead of just knowledge of this park ,COMMA he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants ,COMMA the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts ,COMMA 
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned 
We also want to look for solutions 
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply 
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun 
Thank you 
And my father was a soldier .PERIOD and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher 
For three times i applied to biomedical science ,COMMA to be a doctor .PERIOD 
With the end of the dictatorship regime of mobutu ,COMMA sese seko that most of you know ,COMMA life became very ,COMMA very difficult 
So they started fleeing from the east to the west .PERIOD 
All my friends said we are leaving ,COMMA because we are a target 
But i'm not going to the east ,COMMA because i don't know swahili 
Because he's pygmy .PERIOD he knows how to track elephants in the forest 
They came to told me ,COMMA i have to save him 
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral ,COMMA killing animals ,COMMA the logging timbers .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
That is coltan extraction gold .PERIOD mining .PERIOD 
We have to do it because to let our movement advance 
After a week we celebrated the birthday of that okapi ,COMMA they killed an elephant ,COMMA just 50 meters to the area where the zoo where okapi was born .PERIOD 
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium ,COMMA because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants .PERIOD 
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild ,COMMA or is it a game 
And they can't go even to university 
Thank you .PERIOD thank you 
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real ,COMMA digital human face .PERIOD 
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike aliens and dinosaurs ,COMMA we look at human faces .PERIOD every day 
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds ,COMMA 
If we zoom in on this photograph ,COMMA right here we can see ,COMMA it's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA to get a nice image of her facial texture ,COMMA 
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here 
And thank you very much .PERIOD 
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point ,COMMA 
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places ,COMMA 
Next year ,COMMA i'll be leading an international team to j2 .PERIOD 
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .PERIOD 
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo 
One is how do you do science ?QUESTIONMARK autonomy underground ,COMMA 
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist 
If it passes the microscopic test ,COMMA we go for a collection 
No hands at the wheel 
This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own 
That's more than you pay for ted ,COMMA if google dropped their sponsorship 
There is a place where you can 
If we're going to get that and make that gas station possible ,COMMA we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space .PERIOD 
It has never been done 
I like this equipment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and i really value it .PERIOD so we're not going to burn the gear 
And i'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within .PERIOD and to follow the ted commandments ,COMMA that is ,COMMA actually something that creates a near-death experience ,COMMA but near-death is good for creativity .PERIOD 
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis .PERIOD you know ,COMMA who am i ?QUESTIONMARK why am i this particular person ?QUESTIONMARK why am i not black like everybody else ?QUESTIONMARK 
I used to draw ,COMMA i thought i would be an artist 
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon ,COMMA you begin to think very much about everything 
So in quantum mechanics ,COMMA of course you have dark energy and dark matter .PERIOD 
And that's what i look for in my work ,COMMA a personal meaning 
And they also have to make a living ,COMMA and people need to be fed 
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said ,COMMA human rights in burma 
This leads to this question .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA i was writing a story that included some kind of detail ,COMMA period of history ,COMMA a certain location 
Especially when good things happen ,COMMA and in particular ,COMMA when bad things happen 
But i do think there's a kind of serendipity ,COMMA and i do want to know what those elements are .PERIOD so i can thank them ,COMMA and also try to find them in my life .PERIOD 
Is it because i had the filter that i have such a strong coincidence .PERIOD in writing about these things 
It takes a while ,COMMA but i have to let go of them and just go there and be there 
And the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread ,COMMA no one wanted it 
And when i talk about it ,COMMA i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation ,COMMA and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score 
Well ,COMMA this tv-industrial complex ,COMMA informed my entire childhood and probably yours 
And i ignored every message because i don't have a pain reliever problem .PERIOD 
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because i always have 
Consumers don't care about you at all ,COMMA they just don't care 
Because people saw it and said -- i didn't know that was there -- and they noticed it 
And the thing is people in the fashion business know ,COMMA what it's like to be in the fashion business -- they're used to it 
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way 
How to understand that it's not about interrupting people with big full-page ads or insisting on meetings ,COMMA with people 
He lived in paris last year he sold 10 million dollars' worth of french bread 
It was neat .PERIOD it was remarkable ,COMMA and slowly it spread from one person to another person ,COMMA until finally ,COMMA it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in paris 
They would ignore the geeks ,COMMA and god forbid ,COMMA the laggards 
To make a product to market an idea to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn't have a constituency with an otaku ,COMMA is almost impossible 
Krispy kreme has a strategy ,COMMA and what they do is they enter a city .PERIOD they talk to the people with otaku ,COMMA and then they spread through the city to the people who've just crossed the street 
They're made from cremains 
Oh ,COMMA you like my ring .PERIOD it's my grandmother 
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry 
The first one is design is free .PERIOD when you get to scale 
And the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them 
Silk put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section 
For the people who were there and looking at that section ,COMMA it was remarkable 
And i wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things .PERIOD i was seeing underwater .PERIOD incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .PERIOD 
And the ice that is there is quite thin .PERIOD 
These are the tuna ,COMMA the billfish and the sharks 
But the truth is ,COMMA we're way too efficient at catching them ,COMMA and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .PERIOD 
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process 
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because currently on planet earth ,COMMA we're killing over 100 million sharks .PERIOD every single year 
But before i went out to photograph this component ,COMMA i sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i think there's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark 
One of the locations was this place called tiger beach in the northern bahamas .PERIOD where tiger sharks aggregate ,COMMA in shallow water ,COMMA 
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead ,COMMA an animal that really hadn't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .PERIOD 
But this is crucial habitat ,COMMA and it's where they spend the first two three years of their lives ,COMMA until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .PERIOD 
I actually jumped in and photographed this ,COMMA and with the fisherman's permission ,COMMA i cut the turtle out ,COMMA and it was able to swim free 
But you know ,COMMA thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate .PERIOD and the species' future is in great danger .PERIOD 
You can see the coal burning plant in the background 
I went down there in the winter time 
And these are animals that had never seen humans before .PERIOD and i was one of the first people they probably had ever seen 
For example ,COMMA they hoped that certain species of fish like the new zealand snapper would return .PERIOD because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .PERIOD 
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population ,COMMA low and behold ,COMMA kelp forests emerged in shallow water .PERIOD 
And that's because the urchins eat kelp 
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color 
The ocean is indeed ,COMMA resilient and tolerant to a point ,COMMA but we must be good custodians .PERIOD 
But i'm moving past malthus ,COMMA because i think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment .PERIOD 
And the world's population expected to top out at something ,COMMA hopefully a bit less than 10 billion late .PERIOD this century 
But look what happened in europe after the plague :COLON rising wages ,COMMA land reform ,COMMA technological innovation ,COMMA birth of the middle class ,COMMA and after that ,COMMA forward-looking social movements like the renaissance and later the enlightenment ,COMMA 
Because transitions are dangerous times 
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions 
I was walking in the market one day with my wife and somebody stuck a cage in my face ,COMMA 
So we're in east borneo .PERIOD this is the place where i started 
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .PERIOD 
And once the soil gets dried ,COMMA you're in a dry season -- you get cracks ,COMMA oxygen goes in flames ,COMMA come out .PERIOD and the problem starts all over again .PERIOD 
This is what it looked like for three months 
We lost all the crops .PERIOD no children gained weight for over a year .PERIOD they lost 12 iq points .PERIOD it was a disaster for orangutans ,COMMA and people 
That was why i put it as a single point up there 
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen ,COMMA and without those microorganisms ,COMMA you won't have any performance at all 
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space 
In the beginning ,COMMA maybe pineapples and beans and corn in the second phase ,COMMA there will be bananas and papayas later on there will be chocolate and chilies 
And that's green .PERIOD if you look from the tower -- this is ,COMMA when we start attacking the grass 
Air ,COMMA humidity is up 10 percent 
Each of the families that have sold their land .PERIOD now get a piece of land back 
If one member trespasses the agreement ,COMMA and does cut down trees ,COMMA the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him .PERIOD 
In north sulawesi ,COMMA it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there .PERIOD so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system .PERIOD 
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project 
Now ,COMMA i think the real key to doing it to give a simple answer is integration ,COMMA 
There's no matter of scale .PERIOD it's not a question of scale .PERIOD it's not a question of financial resources ,COMMA 
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city ,COMMA 
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave 
He's a very demanding person 
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks 
So in a city you have to work fast 
And we cannot have all the answers 
You see ,COMMA he's right 
He said ,COMMA there are two types of people in this world .PERIOD those who divide the world into two types ,COMMA and those who do not 
If you said to them don't do this anymore ,COMMA they'd wonder what you were talking about 
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves 
It means challenging what we take for granted things that we think are obvious 
He said ,COMMA this in december 1862 to the second annual meeting of congress 
I ought to explain that ,COMMA i have no idea what was happening at the time 
So no doubt ,COMMA something fascinating was happening in december 1862 ,COMMA which the americans among us will be aware of 
You know what it means 
But our minds are still hypnotized by them ,COMMA and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them 
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches 
She doesn't see the point 
It has multiple functions 
Everybody who's spoken at ted has told us implicitly ,COMMA or sometimes explicitly ,COMMA a different story that life is not linear .PERIOD it's organic 
I don't mean you shouldn't go to college ,COMMA but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go .PERIOD now 
You know ,COMMA to me ,COMMA human communities depend upon a diversity of talent ,COMMA not a singular conception of ability 
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels ,COMMA you know ,COMMA with their resumes ,COMMA flipping through and saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA this is it 
I was very struck by natalie merchant's songs ,COMMA last night ,COMMA recovering old .PERIOD poems ,COMMA 
It's axiomatic ,COMMA why not us 
They went on to describe me as america's greenest ceo 
And theft of our children's future ,COMMA would someday be a crime 
According to paul and anne ehrlich and a well-known environmental impact equation ,COMMA impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population ,COMMA affluence and technology 
Paul and anne ehrlich's environmental impact equation ,COMMA i is equal to p times a times .PERIOD t ,COMMA population ,COMMA affluence and technology 
And i reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes and get rid of t1 ,COMMA altogether ,COMMA we could reduce our impact to zero ,COMMA including our impact on the climate 
Fossil fuel usage is down ,COMMA 60 percent per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables 
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business ,COMMA which we acquired in 1993 right here in california city of industry ,COMMA where water is so precious 
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that's 74000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills ,COMMA closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago ,COMMA 
Costs products ,COMMA people marketplaces -- what else is there 
But the marketplace was down 36 percent 
We can see our way now clear to the top of that mountain 
Who is that person 
And we're all acutely aware .PERIOD what's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet ,COMMA 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song ,COMMA or for free ,COMMA 
The arts reformation ,COMMA like the religious reformation ,COMMA is spurred in part by technology .PERIOD with indeed ,COMMA the printing press really leading the charge on the religious reformation ,COMMA 
This group ,COMMA others have called the pro ams ,COMMA amateur artists doing work at a professional level .PERIOD 
But i want to be clear ,COMMA just as the religious reformation ,COMMA did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood .PERIOD i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA i think ,COMMA rather than being annihilated ,COMMA the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been 
I salute all of you as activists in that quest ,COMMA and urge you to embrace and hold dear ,COMMA the arts in your work ,COMMA whatever your purpose may be 
Thank you 
Manchester craftsmen's guild is named after my neighborhood 
Built in a tough neighborhood ,COMMA where people have been given up for dead 
My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on ,COMMA you have to look like the solution and not the problem 
And now that i'm giving speeches at conferences like ted ,COMMA i got put on the board of the carnegie museum 
Well ,COMMA i think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .PERIOD 
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz -- and john heinz had 600 million dollars .PERIOD and at the time i had about 60 cents 
So at my school ,COMMA we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city ,COMMA because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs ,COMMA but it's better for their heads .PERIOD 
I've actually eaten seven of those baskets ,COMMA and they're very good 
Remember i'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics 
Let me show you what these people do 
We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery .PERIOD so i designed this thing 
So he jumped in the van ,COMMA he went to miss jones' house and said ,COMMA miss jones .PERIOD i knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening ,COMMA but you probably didn't have a ride 
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents 
She said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i work for a company called hewlett-packard 
And i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's an easy solution to that problem .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA because i heard you built the center ,COMMA and i didn't believe that you did it .PERIOD and i wanted to see for myself 
Well ,COMMA we did win .PERIOD and our name was literally in lights over madison square garden 
And that was our first recording studio ,COMMA which was the broom closet .PERIOD 
And this is what i want to do when i grow up 
This is in a place called san francisco 
And i said ,COMMA herbie this is my concept of a training center for poor people 
And now i really want to build one 
And i promised these people that i was going to build this thing ,COMMA and we're going to build it all right .PERIOD 
And i said ,COMMA if i can follow that music ,COMMA i'll get out into the sunlight ,COMMA and i'll be ok ,COMMA 
And i don't think i'm crazy 
So 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being 
At the best you're 10 percent human ,COMMA but more likely about one percent human ,COMMA depending on which of these metrics you like 
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live 
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium ,COMMA a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean named vibrio fischeri 
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room .PERIOD and this is what we see 
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously ,COMMA 
The question that we had is how can bacteria ?QUESTIONMARK these primitive organisms tell the difference from times when they're alone and times when they're in a community ,COMMA and then all do something together 
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean 
And then as the cells grow ,COMMA they're all releasing that molecule into the environment .PERIOD so there's lots of molecule there 
But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence .PERIOD 
This is the vibrio fischeri molecule 
So then we started to look at other bacteria ,COMMA and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered 
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria 
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages 
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other 
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language that allows it to count its own siblings ,COMMA 
Anywhere on your body ,COMMA it looks pretty much like this .PERIOD and what i hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there 
Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics 
And so now ,COMMA of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .PERIOD 
The first one is we've targeted the intraspecies communication system .PERIOD 
I hope that what you've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other 
This is exactly what happens in your body 
But then to finish with a plug for all ,COMMA the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the earth .PERIOD we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules 
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you ,COMMA keeping you healthy 
So ,COMMA i'm really a basic scientist ,COMMA not a clinician ,COMMA but in the last year and a half ,COMMA i've started to switch over to use what we've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices .PERIOD and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this 
It's really our first foray into this 
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means baby's face .PERIOD and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses ,COMMA it knows that what was out there was a baby's face ,COMMA and if it got a different pattern ,COMMA it would know that what was out there was say a dog ,COMMA or another pattern would be a house 
So this is what we've been working on .PERIOD and this is what our prosthetic does 
So a completely blind retina ,COMMA even one with no front-end circuitry at all ,COMMA no photoreceptors .PERIOD can now send out normal signals signals that the brain can understand 
And so with the standard method ,COMMA the cells do fire ,COMMA they just don't fire in the normal firing patterns ,COMMA because they don't have the right code .PERIOD 
This is just actually the first one that we tried 
So it's different from the motor prosthetics where you're communicating from the brain to a device here .PERIOD we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood and be understood by the brain 
You can just call it out 
Who else 
The worst flute players 
Actually that was aristotle's answer too ,COMMA 
Peter the greatest benefit to all 
The greatest benefit to all 
All right 
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD 
And the point the essential nature of musical performance ,COMMA is to produce .PERIOD excellent music 
Suppose you were on the supreme court 
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case 
Raise your hand ,COMMA and we'll try to get you a microphone 
That's part of the game of golf ,COMMA 
Charlie ,COMMA what do you say to warren 
Warren ?QUESTIONMARK i am not a golfer 
He wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent .PERIOD 
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement ,COMMA that is ,COMMA what distinguishes games from productive activity ,COMMA it is quite impossible to say that any of a game's arbitrary rules is essential 
First ,COMMA no real sports fan would talk that way 
On the face of it ,COMMA it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness ,COMMA what's an unfair advantage ?QUESTIONMARK 
So if golfing is the kind of game ,COMMA that can be played while riding around in a golf cart ,COMMA it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer .PERIOD the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes ,COMMA 
How many here favor the first policy .PERIOD the state should recognize traditional marriage .PERIOD only 
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together ,COMMA and actually talk about this a bit more than we do 
That was easy .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ok ,COMMA hands up anyone in the audience who's not sure ?QUESTIONMARK whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA a lot of people said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA city boys have no business telling us rural types .PERIOD what to do with our time 
It's a global trance 
But the question is ,COMMA are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite ,COMMA namely ,COMMA leaving aging as it is 
People worry about overpopulation ,COMMA they say ,COMMA well ,COMMA if we fix aging ,COMMA no one's going to die to speak of ,COMMA or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st .PERIOD giles carelessly 
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things 
But it isn't 
So these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live in terms of remaining life expectancy as measured by their health ,COMMA for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive ,COMMA 
But if you're only 50 ,COMMA then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense ,COMMA in terms of your youthfulness ,COMMA both physical and mental .PERIOD and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA if you're a bit younger than that ,COMMA then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes 
And that's quite a thought 
So in other words ,COMMA we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan ,COMMA starting from the point that we started the therapies 
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes .PERIOD and of course that has enormous implications 
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology .PERIOD the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life .PERIOD starting before we're born 
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate 
So these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago ,COMMA and that is pretty good news ,COMMA because it means that you know ,COMMA we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years .PERIOD so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done .PERIOD 
And you know what happened 
But i mean ,COMMA look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in iraq ?QUESTIONMARK 
And i think we know how to do it ,COMMA and i'll stop there 
Audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases .PERIOD so that individuals live long enough to procreate .PERIOD 
If i project that that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i don't crash on my motorbike 
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price and no reserve 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends ,COMMA including president obama ,COMMA 
I'm here to tell you the story of audur capital ,COMMA which is a financial firm founded by me and kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 ,COMMA just over a year before the economic collapse hit 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence .PERIOD 
So we like to see profits ,COMMA plus positive social and environmental benefits .PERIOD when we invest 
Now that we've had all that happen ,COMMA and we have all this data out there telling us that it's much better to have diversity around the decision-making tables ,COMMA will we see business and finance change 
I want to see more revolutionary thinking ,COMMA and i remain hopeful 
For me ,COMMA it was the start of a long journey ,COMMA but i decided that day to matter 
External debt -- something that i can tell you a long story about ,COMMA because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically 
Because we are confronted with a challenge 
We need to bring it back to say ,COMMA what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want 
And i want to tell you something 
The issue is not that 
She was three years old ,COMMA and i was 15 
Now ,COMMA i put my sister on my back -- burning -- and i walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back ,COMMA 
In about two to three hours ,COMMA she started to move 
You know ,COMMA we have to use it .PERIOD well ,COMMA 
For which many people even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs 
They are just discovering 
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go 
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations with the international organizations ,COMMA and with our private sector ,COMMA 
Aid cannot solve our problems .PERIOD i'm firmly convinced about that 
In fact ,COMMA the chinese minister of finance said to me when i asked him ,COMMA what are we doing wrong in nigeria 
Infrastructure :COLON infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline 
And i repeat it for the continent 
And lastly ,COMMA what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid ,COMMA government ,COMMA private sector and the african as an individual 
I will say ,COMMA though ,COMMA that ,COMMA after having done surgery a lot ,COMMA it's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument .PERIOD 
And i'll tell you that most scientific studies of music ,COMMA they're very dense .PERIOD and when you actually go through them ,COMMA it's very hard to recognize the music in it 
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change .PERIOD in concentration ,COMMA 
Charles limb .PERIOD this is a plastic midi piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments .PERIOD 
And so what we did was ,COMMA we brought professional jazz players to the nih .PERIOD and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left ,COMMA the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same ,COMMA exact chord changes 
And i've listened to that solo 200 times ,COMMA and i still like it 
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity .PERIOD 
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity ,COMMA and i'll summarize that for you here 
Now ,COMMA these are multifunctional areas of the brain 
The fact that we do it over and over again ,COMMA lets you acclimate to your surroundings ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA how do you study rap scientifically 
With this big screen ,COMMA you can all rap with me .PERIOD okay ,COMMA 
He's just memorized ,COMMA a rhyme for us 
And what we see we do see language areas lighting up ,COMMA but then -- eyes ,COMMA closed -- when you are free-styling versus memorizing ,COMMA you've got major visual areas lighting up 
You have heightened brain activity when you're doing a comparable task when that one task is creative .PERIOD and the other task is memorized .PERIOD 
I mean don't get me wrong .PERIOD calculus is an important subject .PERIOD 
And every student who studies math science engineering economics ,COMMA they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college 
It's understanding data 
Look the world has changed from analog to digital 
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain ,COMMA and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity .PERIOD the brain surface is highly folded 
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex ,COMMA so that we can map the signals closer to its source ,COMMA and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .PERIOD 
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .PERIOD 
With neutral .PERIOD there's nothing in particular that evan needs to do 
It takes eight seconds to do this ,COMMA and now that that's done .PERIOD we can choose a movement-based action .PERIOD 
So evan ,COMMA choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .PERIOD 
So the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen ,COMMA and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he's doing that 
The first time nothing will happen ,COMMA because the system has no idea how he thinks about pull 
So one ,COMMA two three go 
Okay ,COMMA 
Ah ,COMMA good job 
That's really amazing 
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions ,COMMA we do that all the time .PERIOD so you can visualize it 
So i'd like to show you a few examples ,COMMA because there are many possible applications for this new interface ,COMMA 
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic ,COMMA but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets .PERIOD 
We could spend hours going over this 
It creates a very high peak power .PERIOD and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things .PERIOD in particular ,COMMA it lets you find hemozoin 
And using both this technique and other optical techniques ,COMMA we think we can make those diagnostics 
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria ,COMMA a way in acute cases ,COMMA to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .PERIOD 
You can give drug administration 
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data 
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed 
So that sets the stage on which you do this 
Now one of the ways you can make them not fly ,COMMA is with ddt 
In 1935 ,COMMA there were 150000 cases a year of malaria in the united states ,COMMA but ddt and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it .PERIOD 
Audience ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nathan myhrvold ?QUESTIONMARK okay ,COMMA so our legal department prepared a disclaimer .PERIOD and here it is 
Now after thinking about this a little bit ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser 
We have the device over here 
Now that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine .PERIOD and let me show you how it works 
This is very satisfying 
It grows and is nurtured 
Basically a restaurant just like any other 
Chairs recycled and recyclable 
I was experimenting with these -- i don't know if you can see it -- but there's a work surface there 
This is the kitchen ,COMMA which is in the same room 
Rather than me ,COMMA putting a dish down ,COMMA they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted 
This is the waste room 
In here ,COMMA i have produce and boxes that are unavoidable 
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside ,COMMA pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism .PERIOD it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof ,COMMA and that in turn is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant ,COMMA cooling them or heating them ,COMMA as the need may be 
In the canal ,COMMA which is just outside the restaurant .PERIOD there is hundreds of meters of coil piping 
He's growing all his own fruit ,COMMA and that's fantastic 
So you've got to watch your space for that 
Okay ,COMMA so this is my next project 
I mean ,COMMA the whole thing is is super-sustainable 
And no one's doing that just yet ,COMMA 
This is a herd ,COMMA and it is built ,COMMA according to genetical codes .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it's a new invention of the wheel 
In fact ,COMMA this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach ,COMMA you will notice it's very hard to do 
Ok ,COMMA good 
So ,COMMA as soon it has been to the sea ,COMMA it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here ,COMMA and it knows always where it is on the beach .PERIOD so it's very simple brain 
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal 
We did haemophilus influenzae .PERIOD and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism ,COMMA that of mycoplasma genitalium 
In 2003 ,COMMA we published our first success 
So ,COMMA ham smith and clyde hutchison ,COMMA developed some new methods for making error-free dna at a small level .PERIOD 
And we can walk through the reasons for that .PERIOD but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from ,COMMA whereas the larger ,COMMA faster-growing cell takes only two days 
It's an amazing step forward ,COMMA but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast .PERIOD 
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning ,COMMA how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them 
We narrowed it down to one fragment .PERIOD we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene 
We got a text from dan saying that now the first blue colonies existed 
So early on ,COMMA we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was synthetic 
It's significant to us 
So when you see how long it took to get an h1n1 vaccine out ,COMMA we think we can shorten that process .PERIOD quite substantially 
You may have heard about the koran's idea of paradise being 72 virgins ,COMMA and i promise i will come back to those virgins 
It's just 29 words in arabic ,COMMA but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation 
But all is not lost in translation 
And that number 72 never appears 
There are no 72 virgins in the koran 
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens ,COMMA and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile .PERIOD female workers 
Here's my study site .PERIOD this is really a picture of ants .PERIOD and the rabbit just happens to be there .PERIOD 
Ants never make more ants .PERIOD colonies make more colonies .PERIOD 
And this shows a recently virgin queen .PERIOD here's her wings .PERIOD 
She lays eggs ,COMMA she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg ,COMMA then it's a larva ,COMMA 
So things happen to an ant colony 
When it rains in the summer ,COMMA it floods in the desert 
And that's the process that i call task allocation 
That is that there are chambers inside ,COMMA they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it 
And finally ,COMMA the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage 
So an ant starts out somewhere near the queen 
The queen's in there somewhere .PERIOD she just lays eggs 
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens isn't true -- you know ,COMMA even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do .PERIOD there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest 
We started out with model airplane paint .PERIOD and then we found these wonderful little japanese markers ,COMMA and they work really well ,COMMA 
And so just to summarize the result .PERIOD well ,COMMA it turns out that yes ,COMMA the different tasks are interdependent 
And the second result ,COMMA which was surprising to a lot of people was that ants actually switch tasks .PERIOD 
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life .PERIOD 
This process changes with colony age ,COMMA and it changes like this 
Instead something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older .PERIOD 
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts ,COMMA the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks .PERIOD in deciding what to do 
And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads ,COMMA and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate .PERIOD 
So i want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out first of all ,COMMA showing you the nest entrance 
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope .PERIOD it's down inside the nest 
Each ant ,COMMA then ,COMMA as it comes back ,COMMA in is contacting other .PERIOD ants ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA what's interesting about this system is that it's messy 
Again ,COMMA i don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision ,COMMA and efficiency of clockwork 
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero this internet of devices 
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully ,COMMA this is a raw material 
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically ,COMMA where you write a code ,COMMA much like protein folding ,COMMA that specifies their structure 
But i had a problem once i had all these machines .PERIOD i was spending too much time teaching students to use them .PERIOD 
When a user screams into scream buddy ,COMMA their scream is silenced 
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll .PERIOD dec is now twice bankrupt .PERIOD you don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy ,COMMA because you can buy it 
And the way you close ,COMMA it is not it for the masses .PERIOD but it development for the masses 
You can see it in their face .PERIOD just this joy of i can do it 
We designed a network sensor ,COMMA and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab 
This is late at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 11 o'clock at night .PERIOD and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time 
And again ,COMMA that was just for the joy of it .PERIOD 
And then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas 
We're learning more from them than we're giving them 
I was showing my kids in a fab lab ,COMMA how to use it 
Real invention is happening in these labs .PERIOD 
Pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers ,COMMA 
It was there ,COMMA because they wanted to find animals in the mountains ,COMMA but it outgrew it .PERIOD so they built this extraordinary village for the lab 
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough ,COMMA you can solve the problems 
The message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren't just technical sinks .PERIOD they're sources 
That has got to be stopped 
Somehow that doesn't seem right 
So here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight ,COMMA importing 12 .PERIOD and from the 12 ,COMMA five comes from opec .PERIOD 
Now i had people in washington last week told me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel ,COMMA 
We're headed to natural gas 
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it 
Natural gas will fit all of those 
It will replace or be able to be used for that 
So i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas 
And where i've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks ,COMMA 
There are eight million of them 
I'm back to theorist again ,COMMA 
So there's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan .PERIOD other than i'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers 
Thank you 
That'll make you abandon something 
I'm a geologist ,COMMA got out of school in '51 .PERIOD and i've been in the industry ,COMMA my entire life 
I'm not a big natural gas producer 
You've made the money you need 
Does that make sense 
The government is not successful on these things 
But chris ,COMMA i think where we're headed the long-term ,COMMA i don't mind going back to nuclear 
There isn't anything wrong with nuke 
Tbp ?QUESTIONMARK fracking :COLON what is fracking 
I mean seriously ,COMMA the department of energy did not have anything to do with fracking 
The first frack job was in '47 
There's no problems 
If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution .PERIOD are you ready to invest in those technologies ,COMMA even if they aren't maximized for profits ,COMMA they might be maximized for the future health of the planet 
When you think about resilience and technology ,COMMA it's actually much easier 
The internet was also very real .PERIOD this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other .PERIOD it's a big deal 
People on the east coast in 1849 ,COMMA when they first started to get the news ,COMMA they thought ,COMMA ah ,COMMA this isn't real .PERIOD 
You had dotcom fever .PERIOD and you had gold fever .PERIOD 
And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half ,COMMA because they were afraid they wouldn't come back 
They had bad burn rate .PERIOD in the gold rush ,COMMA a very bad burn rate .PERIOD 
This is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year 2000 
Bride #1 :COLON you said you had a large selection of invitations .PERIOD clerk ,COMMA but we do 
Husband #2 :COLON not for another 15 minutes .PERIOD announcer :COLON after all ,COMMA it's your special day 
Ourbeginningcom ,COMMA life's an event ,COMMA announce it to the world 
So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic .PERIOD and that analogy is the electric industry 
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital ,COMMA build out 
Well ,COMMA it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down 
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top .PERIOD 
And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning 
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code .PERIOD after they got there 
Because you know ,COMMA resilience -- if you think of it ,COMMA in terms of the gold rush ,COMMA then you'd be pretty depressed ,COMMA right now ,COMMA because the last nugget of gold would be gone 
She -- but you know ,COMMA if you really do believe that it's the very ,COMMA very beginning ,COMMA if you believe it's the 1908 hurley washing machine .PERIOD then you're incredibly optimistic .PERIOD and i do think that that's where we are 
The golden rule is great .PERIOD i'm a big supporter of both 
In the beginning ,COMMA there was compassion .PERIOD and i mean ,COMMA not just when human beings first showed up ,COMMA but actually even before that 
I warned you ,COMMA this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy 
Now ,COMMA there's more good news that came along later in evolution ,COMMA a second kind of evolutionary logic ,COMMA 
And so you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies 
So i hope i've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world 
Basically ,COMMA a zero-sum game is the kind ,COMMA you're used to in sports where there's a winner and a loser .PERIOD 
Either way ,COMMA your fortunes add up to zero .PERIOD that's a zero-sum game .PERIOD 
Now if you're playing doubles ,COMMA then the person on your side of the net ,COMMA is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you ,COMMA because every point is either good for both of you -- positive win-win -- or bad for both of you ,COMMA it's lose-lose .PERIOD 
The deployment of the golden rule .PERIOD most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels 
With zero-sum channels ,COMMA you would expect something else 
But it may ,COMMA and the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness ,COMMA these webs that can be these channels for compassion 
That's the story of civilization ,COMMA 
And also sometimes people don't recognize the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world .PERIOD 
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum ,COMMA relationships economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on .PERIOD in this regard ,COMMA 
If there's one thing i can encourage everyone to do ,COMMA politicians religious leaders and us .PERIOD it would be what i call expanding the moral imagination -- that is to say your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances .PERIOD 
Once upon a time i did a book called how buildings learn 
So the design problem for today ,COMMA is going to be ,COMMA how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this ?QUESTIONMARK so it can really tick ,COMMA save time beautifully for 100 centuries .PERIOD 
And it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about ,COMMA what does deep time do to a building 
This is the parthenon ?QUESTIONMARK it's only 2450 years old ,COMMA and look what happened to it 
And now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for 
Underground in a place that's really solid 
It's right on the eastern border of nevada ,COMMA 
It starts with the image .PERIOD the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal ,COMMA at the end of the journey 
The labyrinth is a concept ,COMMA it's like a twilight zone .PERIOD it's a place where it's difficult ,COMMA where you get disoriented ,COMMA maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it ,COMMA if you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration 
The hillis algorithm .PERIOD 10 factorial gives you that number 
Something you didn't expect that caps ,COMMA what you did expect 
And then how about a memento number ,COMMA seven ,COMMA 
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions 
People think they're just the size of shrubs ,COMMA but that's not actually true 
That's interesting 
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line .PERIOD due east into the range ,COMMA into very interesting territory -- except that as you'll see when we go inside in a minute ,COMMA we were hoping for limestone ,COMMA but in there is just shale 
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring 
You may recognize a couple of the miners there 
And alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine .PERIOD it's a mile deep .PERIOD 
Kurt bollacker ,COMMA and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station 
But there's no bears ,COMMA and there's no poison oak ,COMMA and there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here's a potential approach .PERIOD 
You need to come up the lincoln canyon 
It's a secret passage .PERIOD it's like something from tolkien 
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next thing i hear is ,COMMA i've made it to the top .PERIOD you can see all of creation from up here .PERIOD 
In fact there he is .PERIOD that's alexander rose 
This discovery changed ,COMMA everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them 
So ,COMMA even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA the clock will keep perfectly good time .PERIOD 
So here we're looking from the south look north 
Over on the eastern side it's gentle ,COMMA as you can see 
And that's not snow -- that's what the white limestone looks like 
Another is the experience in the mountain 
And the third is the experience from the mountain ,COMMA which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny ,COMMA and if you look off to the right out there ,COMMA 15 miles across to the schell creek range ,COMMA 
This is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA let's take one more look at the mountain itself .PERIOD 
And this stone takes a perfect polish 
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain 
And often i'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting ,COMMA or pretty or functional in some way that i'd never seen happen before .PERIOD 
I don't know where inspiration comes from 
And i think about ,COMMA you know their roles and about how you have to like ,COMMA watch what your daughters look at 
So actually check this out 
I was dating .PERIOD this guy ,COMMA right 
I was dating this guy ,COMMA and it was going on for about a year right 
And i kind of try not to look back ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
And frankly ,COMMA i don't really know what to call myself 
Too much time on computer bridge ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA like that's ?QUESTIONMARK so somehow ,COMMA like about ten years ago ,COMMA i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a tv studio ,COMMA like for a day ,COMMA show some kind of day talk show 
Because it's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place 
Hi there 
Rod cutting hair 
Just checking ,COMMA because some people want to look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA aggressively ugly 
A oh no ,COMMA we're just staging .PERIOD rod :COLON we're just staging it 
I'll tell you that i cook a lot also ,COMMA i love to cook 
This is what i've been doing ,COMMA because i think it's the most fun thing in the world 
It's got a lot of different things on it 
Yeah ,COMMA but i can never find buttermilk ever .PERIOD 
Chef for cream 
Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around 
Have you ever looked at the arab uprisings and thought ,COMMA how could we have predicted that 
But i believe now that we're moving into a new age .PERIOD and that age the new york times dubbed recently as the age of behavior 
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave 
If we look at islamists if we look at the phenomenon of far-right fascists ,COMMA one thing they've been very good at one thing that they've actually been exceeding in ,COMMA is communicating across borders ,COMMA using technologies to organize themselves to propagate .PERIOD their message and to create truly global phenomena .PERIOD 
But having been born in essex at the age of 16 ,COMMA i joined an organization 
By the age of 24 ,COMMA i found myself convicted in prison in egypt ,COMMA being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments ,COMMA being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience .PERIOD 
The age of behavior where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances .PERIOD 
In certain countries .PERIOD mosque minarets are being banned .PERIOD 
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind 
So the ideas and the narratives of al-qaeda ,COMMA come to your mind immediately 
One of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently ,COMMA 
To go around saying that i believe democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at as a form of political organizing ,COMMA is associated with extremism .PERIOD 
When talking about those reasons ,COMMA let's break down certain preconceptions ,COMMA 
But without freedom of speech ,COMMA you can't have free and fair elections 
In the '80s and '90s when islamism started in the region it spread across the mena region ,COMMA as a whole 
Now that's a big claim .PERIOD i'm going to try to back it up 
Slow ,COMMA text-based conversations ,COMMA then real-time voice based conversations 
He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them ,COMMA 
But they weren't given that choice because their own citizens beat them to the punch .PERIOD 
Essentially to say ,COMMA we will do anything to placate you ,COMMA just please stop protesting in public 
And so the protest kept going 
And so they began to arrest the protesters ,COMMA 
All of that is over 
He had said ,COMMA in january that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons .PERIOD 
It was senator obama when they created it ,COMMA they changed the name later ,COMMA 
He had to issue a reply 
And he said ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA i have considered the issue 
Media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was ,COMMA as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away ,COMMA 
That's the media environment .PERIOD we've got 
And today ,COMMA after the global economic crisis ,COMMA there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene 
The first to my mind is what i call as the ideas that have arrived 
We thought of people as a liability 
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy 
And the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strategic asset 
One is the question of education ,COMMA 
The third thing is again ,COMMA cities 
But today ,COMMA finally ,COMMA after economic reforms and economic growth ,COMMA i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth .PERIOD cities are engines of creativity .PERIOD cities are engines of innovation ,COMMA have finally been accepted 
A lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things ,COMMA 
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment ,COMMA the way we look at energy .PERIOD the way we create whole new paradigms of development .PERIOD 
Why does what's happening ?QUESTIONMARK 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you 
And that makes a huge difference 
When india was growing at about three 35 percent ,COMMA and the population was growing at two percent ,COMMA its per capita income was doubling every 45 years .PERIOD 
I've been there six times four times i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements .PERIOD twice .PERIOD i went with nasa doing remote sensing devices 
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit ,COMMA 
There were three other expeditions on the mountain ,COMMA an american team ,COMMA a new zealand team and an imax team 
And from there ,COMMA we climb up to camp two ,COMMA which is sort of the foreground 
If you notice the summit of everest is black 
This is not good weather to climb in .PERIOD so the climbers are just waiting ,COMMA hoping that the wind's going to die down 
The summit would be in the foreground 
But what happened that year was the wind ,COMMA suddenly and unexpectedly picked up 
I have an oxygen hose connected here 
Ok ,COMMA this is a view taken on the summit ridge ,COMMA itself 
But either way you fall for the rest of your life 
This is taken from camp three ,COMMA where i was 
So as the climbers came by me ,COMMA i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down 
His wife was home in new zealand ,COMMA seven months ,COMMA pregnant with their first child ,COMMA and rob asked to be patched into her that was done .PERIOD and rob and his wife had their last conversation .PERIOD 
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies 
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and try to revive them ,COMMA which is difficult to do at 21000 feet when the tent is freezing 
As i was taking care of these climbers we got a startling experience 
But beck wasn't dead ,COMMA he heard that ,COMMA but he was completely unable to move 
Now you go to this one ,COMMA and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up 
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this 
It's too cold ,COMMA he can't keep his metabolic fires going .PERIOD and you see ,COMMA there's no more red here .PERIOD his brain is quieting down .PERIOD 
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself 
He's not thinking about his family now ,COMMA and he's getting himself motivated 
A helicopter came in at 21000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history 
It's our trailer ,COMMA because i know ,COMMA obviously you guys are busy .PERIOD many of you may not have had a chance to see it 
If we could roll 
Michael moriarty's wife ,COMMA it's really hard for him to not have his dad 
They're shooting at me 
Deborah scranton ?QUESTIONMARK thank you .PERIOD 
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista .PERIOD software 
I mean ,COMMA we were there for an hour talking 
And it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about ,COMMA and hopefully to help with ,COMMA which is i think ,COMMA a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics .PERIOD 
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation 
It was mass casualties 
This is blood 
Five soldiers filmed the entire time 
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives -- the iraqis who work on the post ,COMMA 
And for me ,COMMA it's trying to bridge that disconnect .PERIOD 
I get -- i'm often asked ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for me ,COMMA what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film 
And he looked at me ,COMMA and i smiled ,COMMA and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes .PERIOD 
So when i talk about a disconnect ,COMMA it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier ,COMMA which there obviously ,COMMA are you know these days .PERIOD it's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front .PERIOD and everybody seemed involved 
Do you give money to any of the charities 
Do you really care 
And it was something called ecorock 
And they worked absolutely very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very hard 
That's the finished production line .PERIOD there 
We must change everything 
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound 
And i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom 
It is transparent made just for you 
This is a setup i put in a physics lab 
We need to reach a target inside the brain 
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain .PERIOD noninvasively ,COMMA with focused ultrasound ,COMMA in the '50s ,COMMA 
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed 
They were missing the vision 
It is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville ,COMMA using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .PERIOD 
We attach a transducer ,COMMA in this case to the brain ,COMMA but if it will be a different organ ,COMMA it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .PERIOD 
It's a target in the thalamus 
It doesn't do any damage ,COMMA but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees 
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .PERIOD 
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen ,COMMA then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here 
And you have to understand what is in people's mind when they are willing to take the risk 
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital 
So again ,COMMA this is an immediate relief .PERIOD 
I don't see without this nation ,COMMA taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen .PERIOD it will not happen 
And it's not just because of regulation ,COMMA it's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials .PERIOD and so on to make it happen ,COMMA 
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .PERIOD 
Women suffer from that disease ,COMMA 
In the fashion industry ,COMMA there's very little intellectual property protection 
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists to knock off these designs ,COMMA because they can't knock off the logo

It was a dialog with the context again .PERIOD 
Couldn't find it 
So 
And it's one of the nicest pieces i've ever made .PERIOD i think

Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I know ,COMMA bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes .PERIOD so i'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes ,COMMA which is charcoal .PERIOD 
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal .PERIOD 
After some time ,COMMA after setting it on fire ,COMMA you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln ,COMMA and then you end up with this carbonized material here 
However ,COMMA you can't burn this ,COMMA it's too fine .PERIOD and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking .PERIOD 
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes .PERIOD 
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal ,COMMA where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes .PERIOD and you have the extra step of cooking the binder ,COMMA this comes pre-briquetted 
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits 
They can generate income from this 
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal ,COMMA and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own 
I mean ,COMMA the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand .PERIOD and where when you work 10 hours a day ,COMMA you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month .PERIOD

Good-looking people are always judged as being more friendly 
This is an image of ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed 
So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium .PERIOD 
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives .PERIOD 
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer 
We still can't get rid of scars 
Whereas i felt that when you design you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing in 
Working within the united states ,COMMA most people look at poverty ,COMMA and they see the face of a foreigner ,COMMA but go live -- i live in bozeman ,COMMA montana -- go up to the north plains on the reservations ,COMMA or go down to alabama or mississippi .PERIOD pre-katrina .PERIOD and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries .PERIOD i've been to 
So in the past seven years -- this isn't just about nonprofit 
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller ,COMMA and that we have the opportunity -- not the responsibility ,COMMA but the opportunity -- to really get involved in making change 
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change ,COMMA we build that change .PERIOD 
And it wasn't doctors telling us this .PERIOD it was actual villagers that we were staying with 
We just don't know how to show this 
And on the fourth week ,COMMA the doctors come and they mow out an area ,COMMA put a tensile structure on the top .PERIOD and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers ,COMMA you cut down the clinic ,COMMA and you eat it .PERIOD it's an eat your own clinic 
And you have to keep the maintenance down 
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that doubled as an hiv/aids outreach center ,COMMA and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors

My late ,COMMA lamented friend bob nozick ,COMMA a fine philosopher ,COMMA in one of his books ,COMMA philosophical explanations ,COMMA is commenting on ,COMMA the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .PERIOD 
I'm sure that people here who work on say ,COMMA climate change and global warming ,COMMA or on the future of the internet ,COMMA encounter people who have very strong opinions about what's going to happen .PERIOD next 
But with regard to consciousness ,COMMA people seem to think each of us seems to think i am an expert 
No other ingredients at all ,COMMA we're just made of cells about 100 trillion of them 
The content -- there's color ,COMMA there's ideas ,COMMA there's memories there's history .PERIOD and somehow ,COMMA all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons 
So this is the problem .PERIOD so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you 
It's one that i predicted in the last page ,COMMA or two of my 1991 book ,COMMA consciousness explained where i said if you did experiments of this sort ,COMMA you'd find that people were unable to pick up ,COMMA really large changes 
And as i walked towards the picture ,COMMA i was expecting detail that wasn't there 
You're familiar with a more recent technology ,COMMA which is -- there you can get a better view of the blobs .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion

It's the same thing 
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all 
Is the shape on the left ,COMMA the same as the shape on the right ,COMMA rotated 
Yes 
And if you read that literature ,COMMA one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you're the subject in the experiment ,COMMA you don't know 
Well ,COMMA that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician ,COMMA 
How many of you see that sort of boundary with the necker cube ,COMMA floating in front of the circles 
Can you see it 
When you see the cube one way behind the screen ,COMMA those boundaries go away 
And i supposed that that was just a flat truth always true .PERIOD 
Let me just pause this for a second .PERIOD if i can 
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment

But again ,COMMA then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .PERIOD 
Sam ,COMMA this is a conversation ,COMMA i would actually love to continue for hours 
We don't have that ,COMMA but maybe another time thank you for coming to ted 
And then ,COMMA within zoology ,COMMA i took the course or the discipline of entomology ,COMMA the science of insects 
Because biological control phenomenon ,COMMA you can see it in your backyard .PERIOD 
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere 
So it's everywhere ,COMMA and we need to know how to exploit it 
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant 
Insects ,COMMA those six-legged organisms and spiders or mites ,COMMA the eight-legged organisms 
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf and on the middle cotton leaf ,COMMA and on the left ,COMMA a tomato leaf with these little stipplings 
By the way it's springtime now in israel ,COMMA 
When temperature rises sharply ,COMMA you can see those bad ones .PERIOD those aphids ,COMMA all over the plants ,COMMA in your hibiscus ,COMMA in your lantana ,COMMA in the young ,COMMA fresh foliage of the spring flush ,COMMA so-called 
This is all natural .PERIOD this is all natural 
Again ,COMMA we'll start first with the pest .PERIOD the thrips 
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults 
Many different parts 
By the way they have a very nice landscape -- you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley ,COMMA on the other hand and a good mild winter .PERIOD and a nice hot summer ,COMMA which is an excellent condition to mass-produce those creatures 
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals 
In this table ,COMMA you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .PERIOD 
But if we go ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to this place ,COMMA southeast israel ,COMMA the arava area above the great rift valley ,COMMA where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located ,COMMA especially under greenhouse conditions ,COMMA or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to eilat ,COMMA you see this just in the middle of the desert 
Step by step ,COMMA it does narrow 
So i'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers ,COMMA in israel and abroad ,COMMA really give nature a chance .PERIOD 
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ?QUESTIONMARK the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today ,COMMA because today ,COMMA as well ,COMMA there are some societies that have already collapsed ,COMMA such as somalia and rwanda ,COMMA and the former yugoslavia .PERIOD there are also societies today that may be close to collapse .PERIOD such as nepal ,COMMA indonesia and columbia 
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have 
Why did they all end up dead ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in my five-point framework .PERIOD the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment ,COMMA people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend .PERIOD and in the case of the viking norse ,COMMA the vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation ,COMMA which was a particular problem for them ,COMMA because they required forests to make charcoal to make iron .PERIOD 
Or again ,COMMA the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades ,COMMA maybe within a decade of the time .PERIOD when the soviet union was at its greatest power ,COMMA 
So this is a frequent theme societies collapse .PERIOD very soon after reaching their peak in power 
And i would expect that if our human civilization carries on ,COMMA then maybe in the next century ,COMMA people will be asking why on earth did these people today in the year ?QUESTIONMARK 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action 
One blueprint for trouble ,COMMA making collapse likely is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term interest of the society as a whole ,COMMA especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions where what's good in the short run ,COMMA for the elite is bad for the society as a whole ,COMMA there's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run 
So that's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions conflicts of interest 
Instead ,COMMA all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making .PERIOD and since we made the problems we can also solve the problems that then means that it's entirely in our power to deal with these problems .PERIOD 
So i think i'm actually the first one here -- i lead 
And meanwhile ,COMMA i use nonsense as you can see 
This was one of a series called zany afternoons which became a book .PERIOD 
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man 
There's moscow shirley hope ,COMMA they speak esperanto .PERIOD 
Those for example ,COMMA are mark iv british tanks from 1916 
Happy little story isn't it 
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there 
It's obviously modeled on the titanic .PERIOD 
I thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it .PERIOD 
This is the word side of my brain 
And then ,COMMA when it ran ,COMMA a lovely ,COMMA lady ,COMMA an old lady named mrs .PERIOD edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said ,COMMA she loved the cover .PERIOD it was so sweet 
Pretty elegant ,COMMA nothing like a crash to end .PERIOD a joke .PERIOD that completes my oeuvre .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA i'm going to show you again ,COMMA something about our diets ,COMMA 
There's six million species of insects on this planet ,COMMA six million species 
There was an estimation ,COMMA a conservative estimation ,COMMA a couple of years ago that the us economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .PERIOD 
Small animals eat insects .PERIOD 
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars .PERIOD locusts ,COMMA bee pupae -- delicacies 
You're eating at least 500 grams per year .PERIOD 
We're even doing this on purpose ,COMMA 
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth ,COMMA 
There was an fao conference ,COMMA last ,COMMA october ,COMMA that was completely devoted to this 
And we eat quite a lot of it 
In the developing world ,COMMA it's much lower 
So if you would be an entrepreneur ,COMMA what would you do 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor 
There are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them .PERIOD and one of them is here in the audience ,COMMA marian ,COMMA peeters ,COMMA who's in the picture 
Well ,COMMA in the netherlands ,COMMA we have an innovative minister of agriculture ,COMMA and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .PERIOD 
Reset the three minutes that's just not fair 
I would still be on my bad hip that was so disappointing .PERIOD 
Great excellent .PERIOD 
So no suddenly i wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list 
They were desperate for volunteers ,COMMA because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 ,COMMA 
So next thing ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i had my bright blue volunteer vest ,COMMA i had my photo id .PERIOD and i was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss 
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office 
But i'd like to ask you ,COMMA how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iphone 
You know ,COMMA i've always wanted one of these 
And this one ,COMMA this is a replica from a 15th-century device ,COMMA 
So tonight ,COMMA if it's clear ,COMMA you'll be able to see the summer triangle ,COMMA 
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device .PERIOD 
He would know what time the sun would rise .PERIOD and what time it would set 
Probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper .PERIOD and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket 
So ?QUESTIONMARK what does the astrolabe inspire 
And what we gain with a new technology ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is precision and accuracy 
I'm just going to show you how the robot works 
So even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this ,COMMA really ,COMMA we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot .PERIOD thus it's a biologically inspired robot .PERIOD 
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion 
We developed our adaptive gait planner 
Welcome to romela ,COMMA the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia ,COMMA tech 
This robot is an amoeba robot .PERIOD 
Robotic air powered hand with elastic ligaments 
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction ,COMMA 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in iraq ,COMMA you know the war zone ,COMMA there is roadside bombs .PERIOD currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed 
We actually have a fan club for the robot ,COMMA darwin dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence 
So based on that success ,COMMA the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics 
And thus darwin ,COMMA i was born in 2005 
Dennis hong ,COMMA so there is actually a competition called robocup .PERIOD 
We were the very first team in the united states that qualified in the humanoid robocup ,COMMA competition 
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states .PERIOD so stay tuned .PERIOD 
How do we develop these kinds of ideas 
We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments .PERIOD we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge .PERIOD 
We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind 
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity ,COMMA 
For us roboticists ,COMMA engineers and scientists .PERIOD these tools ,COMMA these are the courses and classes you take in class 
These are all the tools that we need 
Bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america .PERIOD 
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied ,COMMA and in use 
He was brought in in october 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system .PERIOD 
So in february of 2009 ,COMMA dr .PERIOD zullinger invited us project h design -- which is a non-profit design firm that i founded -- to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district ,COMMA and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district ,COMMA 
We now call this place home 
But beyond our personal reasons ,COMMA for wanting to be there ,COMMA there is a huge need 
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming .PERIOD and being a kid 
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer ,COMMA and we're helping dr .PERIOD zullinger develop ,COMMA some strategies around how we might connect the classroom .PERIOD and the home to extend learning beyond the school day .PERIOD 
So we thought what if you could bring back shop class ,COMMA but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed .PERIOD and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process .PERIOD 
So over the course of two semesters ,COMMA the fall and the spring ,COMMA the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4500 square foot studio/shop space 
So what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills ,COMMA so that she might give back in the most meaningful way ,COMMA 
So for him ,COMMA studio ,COMMA h offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect ,COMMA everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client .PERIOD 
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors ,COMMA about what kind of food ,COMMA they buy and from where ,COMMA and why -- that's a homework assignment 
Because when you zoom out that far you lose the ability to view people as humans 
If you are a blind child in india ,COMMA you will very likely have to contend with ,COMMA at least two big pieces of bad news 
So i felt that i needed to do two things 
Here's the eye with the opaque lens ,COMMA the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted 
In fact ,COMMA the story holds true .PERIOD even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation 
So the way we study that is ,COMMA let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity 
And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies ,COMMA but i want to highlight one particular one .PERIOD and that is image parsing into objects 
So any image of the kind that you see on the left ,COMMA be it a real image or a synthetic image ,COMMA it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column ,COMMA regions of different colors ,COMMA different luminances 
And nobody knows how this integration happens .PERIOD and that's the question we asked with project prakash ,COMMA 
Doctor ,COMMA what are their shapes 
Doctor now 
So we are creating dylan ,COMMA which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive and autonomously .PERIOD discovering what are the objects in this visual input ,COMMA 
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like 
What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input .PERIOD the baby very quickly is able to discover meaning in such input ,COMMA 
Even before the ball gets to a place ,COMMA the child is already looking there 
So to summarize prakash ,COMMA in its five years of existence ,COMMA it's had an impact in multiple areas ,COMMA ranging from basic neuroscience ,COMMA plasticity and learning in the brain to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism ,COMMA the development of autonomous machine vision systems ,COMMA education of the undergraduate and graduate students ,COMMA and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA he's thinking ,COMMA what am i getting myself into 
And he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA really you can 
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run .PERIOD at a collegiate level 
It was really really hot 
And it's the first -- i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio ,COMMA and i didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and i'd be kind of ,COMMA pistoning in the socket 
He kept me on the right track 
Everyone was taking pictures -- what is this girl running on 
I'm sitting there like ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my god 
So they call us out ,COMMA and you know -- ladies you have one minute 
And i had to think ,COMMA why did i do this 
You know ,COMMA show us more than one set of legs 
No ,COMMA these are my cosmetic legs actually ,COMMA and they're absolutely beautiful .PERIOD 
It has a shock absorber in it ,COMMA so it like shhhh makes this neat sound when you jump around on it ,COMMA all right ,COMMA 
In these 
For me ,COMMA while i'm such a serious athlete .PERIOD on the track ,COMMA i want to be feminine off the track .PERIOD and i think it's so important ,COMMA not to be limited in any capacity ,COMMA whether it's you know ,COMMA your mobility ,COMMA or even fashion 
I mean ,COMMA i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes i want ,COMMA the skirts i want -- and i'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people 
Two weeks ago ,COMMA aimee was up for the arthur ashe award .PERIOD at the espys ,COMMA 
They didn't even want to touch that one .PERIOD they just did it 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy 
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately ,COMMA my weight is a little higher than that .PERIOD but -- all about what happens 
So i think ,COMMA in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating 
It's the chore 
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means ,COMMA 
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor .PERIOD 
And i'll say ,COMMA hmm ,COMMA not sure ,COMMA i'll think about it roughly 
Well ,COMMA one of them is they say you need to get the basics .PERIOD first ,COMMA 
That somehow ,COMMA if you use a computer ,COMMA it's all mindless button-pushing ,COMMA but if you do it by hand ,COMMA it's all intellectual 
Might have been 50 years ago ,COMMA but it isn't anymore 
Why are we using computers to show a student ,COMMA how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ,COMMA 
Same principles applied -- calculations ,COMMA harder 
So the problem we've really got in math .PERIOD education is not that computers might dumb it down ,COMMA but that we have dumbed-down problems right now 
So ,COMMA if you go through lots of examples ,COMMA you can get the answer ,COMMA you can understand how the basics of the system work better 
So programming is the way i think we should be doing that 
This was an example i built for my daughter 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus .PERIOD and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides 
And yet ,COMMA that's a really important practical view of the world 
It's like the land and the king they're inseparable .PERIOD they are one 
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers 
And finally ,COMMA to pull out all the stops .PERIOD this is a system called urp for urban planners ,COMMA in which we give architects and urban planners ,COMMA back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use cad systems 
It projects down digital shadows as you see here 
There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate ,COMMA even though they don't know anything about urban planning to move a building .PERIOD you simply reach out your hand .PERIOD and you move the building 
This work is 15 years old .PERIOD 
And the great thing about it was that alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude ,COMMA the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film ,COMMA be believable ,COMMA that he allowed us to take on that design work .PERIOD as if it were an r&ampd effort ,COMMA 
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual 
People still reference those sequences in minority report ,COMMA when they talk about new ui design 
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the united states .PERIOD 
This is a system called tamper ,COMMA which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be 
We'll go over to jacques tati here and grab our blue friend ,COMMA and put him down on the table as well .PERIOD 
Let me leave with one final thought ,COMMA and that is that one of the greatest english language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift 
Can it be for every man ,COMMA or is this just for corporations and movie producers ,COMMA 
That's our goal entirely 
So this is the inevitability about it 
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig 
It was a wonderful experience 
You can just google it 
As i say ,COMMA in my book ,COMMA i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian .PERIOD 
The first thing i did was ,COMMA i got a stack of bibles .PERIOD 
I had christian bibles .PERIOD 
So i wanted to follow that rule 
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging 
But it's a big part of the bible .PERIOD so i figured i had to address it 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind 
And i explained my project and he said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i am an adulterer .PERIOD are you going to stone me 
They really did a fantastic job 
I wanted it to be about religion in america ,COMMA 
So this was very inspiring to me 
I recommend jim wallis and tony campolo ,COMMA 
They're very inspiring leaders ,COMMA even though i disagree with much of what they say 
And i would say ,COMMA but that's crazy 
The key is to pick and choose the right parts 
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion .PERIOD and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way ,COMMA and they'll say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA it's just cafeteria .PERIOD religion 
You're just picking and choosing 
The story starts in kenya in december of 2007 ,COMMA when there was a disputed presidential election ,COMMA and in the immediate aftermath of that election ,COMMA there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .PERIOD 
And she quickly said it's too much 
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform 
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large ,COMMA sometimes global projects ,COMMA 
And once they've done it ,COMMA they can do it again ,COMMA and they could work on getting it better 
Even with the sacred printing press ,COMMA we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .PERIOD 
So before i talk about what is i think the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi ,COMMA i want to talk about their shared source 
At pick-up time the teachers who have been with your children all day ,COMMA would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back 
Late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average ,COMMA and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine 
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones 
It's value created by the participants ,COMMA but enjoyed by society as a whole 
The goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants ,COMMA but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating ,COMMA 
We've got a choice before us 
And may it run forever ,COMMA because it gives people like me a living 
There were two sundays in between ,COMMA but of course ,COMMA sundays are church days .PERIOD so you don't play on sundays and one day it rained ,COMMA so they all sat around making friends with each other 
And then you worked out your strategy ,COMMA and you came and fought the next day ,COMMA and you went back home again ,COMMA 
Take a look ,COMMA you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there .PERIOD you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere because the bat hit the wall .PERIOD don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires ,COMMA 
As you can see ,COMMA you can play anywhere 
And we won this world cup in 1983 
And so we allowed multinationals into india ,COMMA 
We cut customs duties ,COMMA we reduced import duties ,COMMA and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets ,COMMA who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach .PERIOD every indian 
But what a game we had m .PERIOD s .PERIOD dhoni got it right in the air ,COMMA but misbah-ul-haq ,COMMA what a player 
A massive ,COMMA massive success ,COMMA india ,COMMA the world .PERIOD tt champions .PERIOD 
So it was a different india 
Now ,COMMA all of the sudden ,COMMA if you were to bowl a shot -- if mumbai were to bowl a shot ,COMMA for example ,COMMA they needn't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park ,COMMA or somewhere to source them .PERIOD they could go to trinidad .PERIOD 
So he played in hyderabad ,COMMA went straight .PERIOD after the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport ,COMMA sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in portugal .PERIOD second refueling in brazil ,COMMA he was in west indies in time .PERIOD 
They started going to the cricket to watch shah rukh khan 
For a long time ,COMMA india was this country of poverty ,COMMA dust ,COMMA beggars ,COMMA snake charmers ,COMMA filth ,COMMA delhi belly -- people heard delhi belly stories .PERIOD before they came 
Hopefully it'll make everyone richer ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA it'll make the game bigger .PERIOD and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business 
We all make decisions every day ,COMMA we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains ,COMMA from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic 
And surely ,COMMA if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times that would be a tremendous gift 
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet .PERIOD 
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy .PERIOD there are six sides to a die ,COMMA two sides to a coin .PERIOD 52 cards in a deck 
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter 
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery 
Well ,COMMA there are many answers .PERIOD but one answer surely ,COMMA is we see a lot of winners right ?QUESTIONMARK when this couple wins ,COMMA the lottery or ed mcmahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size ?QUESTIONMARK i don't know 
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost 
You can't say to yourself ,COMMA i'm as likely to win as anybody because you're not as likely to win as leroy .PERIOD 
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages .PERIOD even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period ,COMMA here's another nice example .PERIOD 
Here's a $2000 hawaiian vacation package ;SEMICOLON it's now on sale for 1600 
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal .PERIOD in other words ,COMMA a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal .PERIOD that was once a horrible deal 
Now ,COMMA just in case you're not getting it .PERIOD here's a schematic of what happened ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
The difference is that when you lost the ticket ,COMMA you say to yourself ,COMMA i'm not paying twice for the same thing .PERIOD 
Nonetheless ,COMMA their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience .PERIOD 
When you go to buy groceries with it ,COMMA it doesn't go .PERIOD i'm the money saved on the car stereo ,COMMA or i'm the dumb money saved on the car .PERIOD it's money 
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks ,COMMA it's worth 100 bucks .PERIOD no matter what you're saving it on .PERIOD people don't think that way 
Well ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA people are enormously impatient 
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months 
This is just a graph showing the results that i just suggested you would show if i gave you time to respond ,COMMA which is people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now or one month ,COMMA respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern .PERIOD when you push the entire decision off into the future ,COMMA a year 
What causes the bug is it ?QUESTIONMARK the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular 
I don't want to say -- please i'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying .PERIOD terrorism is fine ,COMMA and we shouldn't be so distressed 
What i'm saying is that surely rationally ,COMMA our distress about things that happen about threats ,COMMA should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come 
There's no question 
And so we evolved these responses 
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning 
That's what you think it is all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And as a result ,COMMA many people look at economists as stupid people 
It's the sequel to an inconvenient truth ,COMMA and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .PERIOD 
Or we can scroll through the pages at the bottom 
Mike matas .PERIOD and so throughout the whole book ,COMMA al gore will walk you through and explain the photos 
This photo ,COMMA you can you can even see on an interactive map 
And while it's playing ,COMMA we can pinch and peak back at the page .PERIOD and the movie keeps playing 
This is very strange for me ,COMMA because i’m not used to doing this .PERIOD i usually stand on the other side of the light .PERIOD and now i'm feeling the pressure i put other people into ,COMMA and it's hard 
So we’ll go with the first piece 
Court ,COMMA i don't want to get rid of you 
Boy ,COMMA look man ,COMMA reading don't feed no one 
Boy arguing with you is a waste of time .PERIOD marcus :COLON 
Marcus ,COMMA when a man resorts to profanities ,COMMA it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself 
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from hollywood ,COMMA to go and film something real 
The first piece was really ,COMMA there's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling .PERIOD she'll be happy .PERIOD there 
So that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece .PERIOD 
Commander soldiers ,COMMA you are going to fight a battle .PERIOD so you must get ready and willing to die 
C success .PERIOD the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun 
I don’t remember how we got there 
The injection made us not to have mind 
Various voices ,COMMA you will die .PERIOD you will die 
Onicha .PERIOD ezra 
Why you giving these to me 
Mr .PERIOD ezra .PERIOD gelehun ,COMMA please stand 
No ,COMMA we don’t 
Mr .PERIOD gelehun ,COMMA i'd like to remind you you're not on trial here today 
You are not on trial 
E ,COMMA so you are a liar 
Thank you 
In the process of my research ,COMMA i actually spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this 
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them 
Frank gehry :COLON i listened to this scientist this morning 
I mean ,COMMA it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time .PERIOD 
And i realized when i'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff .PERIOD and people would just look at me like i'd just landed from mars 
And like the playwright said the other day -- i could relate to him ,COMMA you're not sure 
Yeah ,COMMA 
There aren't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients 
If you think about the world ,COMMA and even just in this audience ,COMMA most of us are involved with buildings 
I knew craig and respected him 
I knew you'd ask that question 
I tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off ,COMMA and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't 
Siza on the other hand ,COMMA continued in portugal ,COMMA where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language .PERIOD that relates to that historic language 
I tried to get him a couple of jobs ,COMMA and they didn't pan out 
Where you it's like jazz .PERIOD you improvise .PERIOD you work together .PERIOD you play off each other .PERIOD you make something they make something 
Richard koshalek ,COMMA [unclear] starts from 2004 
You can come to the opening ,COMMA i'll invite you 
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at ted 
They came for three days 
You've all heard the frank lloyd wright story ,COMMA when the woman called and said ,COMMA mr .PERIOD wright ,COMMA i'm sitting on the couch ,COMMA and the water's pouring in on my head 
Rsw :COLON didn't get a laugh 
What do you bring to it ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's what reminded me of it 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor ,COMMA we went to the harbor commissioner 
We sat down ,COMMA and we had a drink of water ,COMMA and everybody was quiet 
So i got up 
They just brought us there to hustle this group ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to create a project 
Because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody .PERIOD so 
But reliable dutchman -- -- fantastic 
And this was the text -- in words as fashion the same rule will hold/ alike fantastic if too new or old/ be not the first by whom the new are tried/ ,COMMA nor yet the last to lay the old aside 
So it was going nowhere 
That's what happens 
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations ,COMMA 
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious 
But we don't have time 
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it ,COMMA and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive ,COMMA and i didn't want to be embarrassed .PERIOD so i worked very hard on this 
But i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to determine what art was 
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes 
And of course ,COMMA if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it ,COMMA in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up 
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways .PERIOD 
So this is the question ,COMMA my students ,COMMA and i wanted to get at 
What if we put holly into the same context ,COMMA as humans 
Because you know it's great for us ,COMMA but bad for humans ,COMMA 
They were these kind of weird things 
So the monkeys get really good at this 
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other often from us -- you know ,COMMA things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing ,COMMA but things we spontaneously saw 
We were a little impatient .PERIOD so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit 
Sounds great ,COMMA but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money .PERIOD 
Your other option is a bit safe ,COMMA your just going to get some money for sure 
So see what your intuition is here 
Most people say ,COMMA why should i be risky when i can get 1500 dollars for sure 
And now imagine that i have you make another choice .PERIOD but this time it's a little bit worse .PERIOD 
They actually tend to go a little risky 
And this means that sometimes we'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this 
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss .PERIOD 
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they're evaluating them in relative terms ,COMMA 
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases 
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero 
Now ,COMMA the monkeys meet two guys who aren't giving them bonuses ,COMMA they're actually giving them less than they expect .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know a little bad -- sorry ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD sorry .PERIOD 
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red ,COMMA when you're watching your house price ,COMMA go down ,COMMA you're not going to be able to see that in anything ,COMMA but old evolutionary terms .PERIOD 
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations 
We have this great north ,COMMA and there was a pretty small population .PERIOD and my father was an avid outdoorsman 
But what i think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that's happening .PERIOD and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines ,COMMA the untouched forest that i was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time that this has gone on for a long time ,COMMA and we're experiencing it in a different way .PERIOD 
This rebirth of grass ,COMMA and then i went out for years ,COMMA trying to photograph the pristine landscape 
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions .PERIOD 
But we've become totally disconnected from them 
That if we keep putting things through industrial and urban existence ,COMMA back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on 
Because i think everything that we're involved in -- our clothing ,COMMA our cars ,COMMA our roads ,COMMA and everything -- are directly a result .PERIOD 
I'm going to move to some pictures of china 
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long ,COMMA one of the largest reservoirs ever created 
And again the rebuilding of the city -- to me ,COMMA it was sad to see that they didn't really grab a lot of ,COMMA i guess what we know here in terms of urban planning .PERIOD 
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country ,COMMA 
So this is a pink uniform at this factory .PERIOD it's a shoe factory .PERIOD 
And they have dorms for the workers 
This is one with 45000 .PERIOD so every lunch ,COMMA there's about 12000 coming through for lunch 
They sit down ,COMMA they have about 20 minutes 
They're not getting enough ,COMMA so they're not going to move 
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level that i don't think any city has experienced 
In fact ,COMMA even shenzhen ,COMMA the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100000 people .PERIOD and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million 
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot .PERIOD 
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with china is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology 
But that is the trick that they've got right now that they're winning with is that they're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines ,COMMA and bringing all the components into play ,COMMA but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work .PERIOD they want to work 
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot .PERIOD 
There are 500 of these machines ,COMMA they're worth about 200000 dollars each 
So you have about 12 people running this ,COMMA and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines 
This was one of the biggest factories i've ever seen 
But this is what happens to most of the computers 
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems .PERIOD i'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world ,COMMA and will start to have a positive effect .PERIOD 
Some of you might know ,COMMA he's a tedster -- stephen sagmeister ,COMMA and i are working on some layouts .PERIOD and this is still in preliminary stages .PERIOD these aren't the finals ,COMMA but these images ,COMMA with worldchangingcom ,COMMA can be placed into any kind of media 
So we're looking at this as trying to build out 
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic 
That would be fantastic .PERIOD so those are my three wishes 
And i'd like to start at the very beginning ,COMMA 
The more stuff that's mine .PERIOD the better 
And of course it's your stuff if it's broken 
And they extract the metals by hand .PERIOD 
So about 20 years ago ,COMMA i literally started in my garage tinkering around ,COMMA trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other ,COMMA and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends in the mining world ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and in the plastics world ,COMMA and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world ,COMMA 
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant ,COMMA that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life .PERIOD our plants can make any type of plastic .PERIOD we feed them 
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics ,COMMA not only by type ,COMMA but by grade 
So i hope i've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life 
Mother nature wastes very little ,COMMA reuses practically everything 
And i hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that's a label i've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .PERIOD 
Now it was not always wonderful at that table .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing ,COMMA and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed ,COMMA except that daddy messed it up 
Now that's compassion 
So let me tell you ,COMMA i kind of look at the world .PERIOD this way 
I see -- always it stirs my heart -- a picture of dr .PERIOD martin luther king ,COMMA jr ,COMMA 
This is the picture ,COMMA they said ,COMMA it's going to be too volatile for you to go 
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself .PERIOD 
And whatever else is needed ,COMMA i will provide it and pay for it .PERIOD when i return 
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan .PERIOD 
But now to be a good samaritan -- and i always say ,COMMA and to be a good american -- for me ,COMMA is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care .PERIOD 
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly ,COMMA this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering ,COMMA but to all who sign the charter for compassion ,COMMA 
I just want to say my name is :COLON emmanuel jal :COLON 
And also telling it like now ,COMMA 
And also the easiest ,COMMA one was when i was doing it in form of a music 
I wanted to revenge for my village 
My every moment 
Run duck play dead and hide 
But still ,COMMA as i wonder ,COMMA i won't go under 
I was ready to eat 
Give us tools give the farmers tools 
And now we have a couple in university 
♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ♫ ♫ what would i be ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA yeah ?QUESTIONMARK ♫ ♫ yeah ,COMMA i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease .PERIOD ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refugee ♫ thank you 
We've used fear if you like to grab people's attention ,COMMA 
A deer freezes very ,COMMA very still poised to run away 
And i think that's what we're doing when we're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change 
And unsurprisingly ,COMMA people all around the world ,COMMA say that what they want is happiness for themselves for their families ,COMMA their children ,COMMA their communities 
Okay ,COMMA they think money is slightly important 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck 
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [the] western world -- a quarter of the resources 
What's happening in ,COMMA costa rica 
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources 
And so in strict happy-planet methodology ,COMMA we've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome .PERIOD we want to 
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 
And i put it to you that is not business as usual .PERIOD 
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing 
And the point of these is they are not quite the secrets of happiness ,COMMA but they are things that i think ,COMMA happiness will flow out the side from 
Keep building them 
The second one is be active 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness ,COMMA cognitive behavioral therapy ,COMMA [very] strong for our well being 
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .PERIOD 
All that being good and no real credit for it 
So i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA mom and dad what about santa claus 
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on christmas morning .PERIOD but only if all of us ,COMMA kids did not make a fuss 
There's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence .PERIOD our family was too strange and weird for even santa claus to come visit .PERIOD and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment ,COMMA this humiliation of rejection by santa who was jolly -- but let's face it .PERIOD he was also very judgmental .PERIOD 
They had to fit two criteria .PERIOD they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason and not yet seven 
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven ,COMMA and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against god and man and bill said ,COMMA so ,COMMA and then i said ,COMMA so ,COMMA you're six ,COMMA you have a whole year to do anything you want to .PERIOD and god won't notice it .PERIOD and he said ,COMMA so ,COMMA and i said ,COMMA so so everything ,COMMA and i turned to run ,COMMA i was so angry with him .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA listen ,COMMA the cut-off date to start .PERIOD kindergarten was september 15 .PERIOD 
So i took the bus downtown to get the new libra poster 
Now ,COMMA i was raised in the pacific northwest ,COMMA around a lot of church of latter-day saints people ,COMMA and you know i've worked with them ,COMMA and even dated them ,COMMA but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission .PERIOD and i guess i was sort of curious .PERIOD so i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA please come in .PERIOD and they looked really happy ,COMMA because i don't think this happens to them all that often 
And i sat them down ,COMMA and i got them glasses of water -- ok ,COMMA i got it .PERIOD i got them glasses of water .PERIOD 
And they told me this story .PERIOD all about this guy named lehi who lived in jerusalem in 600 bc ,COMMA 
I wanted to say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA don't start with this story 
I said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA come on .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 ,COMMA assuming they didn't die from exhaustion .PERIOD it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of god .PERIOD and they said ,COMMA no ,COMMA 
And they said ,COMMA oh -- hey ,COMMA well ,COMMA we also believe that when you go to heaven ,COMMA you get your body restored to you in its best original state 
Or if you'd gone blind ,COMMA you could see 
If someone came to my door and i was hearing catholic ,COMMA theology and dogma for the very first time ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA we believe that god impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse .PERIOD and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby .PERIOD and that's the son of god .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA i would think that's equally ridiculous 
Yes ,COMMA breast cancer 
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control ,COMMA i shed copious tears and asked my dear husband ,COMMA jayant 
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule ,COMMA 
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you ,COMMA so moves you that something even like cancer becomes insignificant 
It's the power of an image 
Nobody really did anything with it pretty much 
They brought all sorts of different computers with them 
So that in all that diversity ,COMMA if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this everything i looked into ,COMMA i had to connect to some new machine .PERIOD i had to learn to run some new program .PERIOD i would find the information i wanted in some new data format 
And that is what has made it most fun 
They're much more than we'd originally imagined when we put together the little initial website that we started off with 
One of the great -- yes ,COMMA a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great ted talks 
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed for various different countries in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality ,COMMA and he shot this thing animated through time 
So he'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world .PERIOD 
It had underground all the data ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK data is brown and boxy and boring .PERIOD and that's how we think of it ,COMMA isn't it 
In this case hans had put the data together .PERIOD he had found from all kinds of united nations ,COMMA websites and things 
We're using them for people ,COMMA we're using them for places .PERIOD we're using them for your products .PERIOD we're using them for events 
I wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago .PERIOD and soon after that things started to happen ,COMMA 
Ok ,COMMA we have to ask for raw data now 
Practice that it's important ,COMMA because you have no idea ,COMMA the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data ,COMMA and not give it to you ,COMMA even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer .PERIOD 
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half-formed ideas in their head .PERIOD they try to communicate those over the web 
And that is what linked data is all about 
You get this really huge power out of it 
Then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that i felt good about myself 
Right now ,COMMA as bill mcdonough has pointed out ,COMMA the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences 
And i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless .PERIOD and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go .PERIOD they had a diagnosis .PERIOD it made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where when we see when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision ,COMMA it stays on the periphery .PERIOD 
One day soon ,COMMA after that -- it was a friday -- at the end of the day ,COMMA i went down -- i was going down to the subway .PERIOD it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs .PERIOD 
And anyway ,COMMA the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off 
And then yes ,COMMA all these other ones as well .PERIOD i mean ,COMMA how do you do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
So i suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage .PERIOD since you asked the question 
So just help us with some of the numbers 
I mean ,COMMA how big is the group overall 
No ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA i think -- ca ,COMMA but is that your hair 
Ok ,COMMA 
Of course ,COMMA 
Yeah ,COMMA well ,COMMA 25 years earlier ,COMMA we'd launched the sex pistols' .PERIOD god ,COMMA save the queen .PERIOD and i'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us 
Well ,COMMA i got pulled out of the sea .PERIOD i think six times by helicopters so -- and each time i didn't expect to come home to tell the tale 
But the ends of all those balloon trips were ,COMMA you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time .PERIOD and on that particular occasion ,COMMA the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped and left me holding on for dear life .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA no ,COMMA i put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute ,COMMA looking at the swirling clouds below ,COMMA trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea ,COMMA which -- and it was a very ,COMMA very very lonely few moments 
The years -- and until i stopped looking at the polls ,COMMA you were sort of regarded as this great hero ,COMMA in the uk and elsewhere .PERIOD 
Ok ,COMMA this isn't exactly hardball ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 
Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school ,COMMA 
And generally the people would say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's bad news .PERIOD 
Did this really happen 
And making us go on wonderful ,COMMA long bike rides 
But is there a risk here 
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the uk .PERIOD 
We changed it to social diseases ,COMMA and people came along with acne and spots ,COMMA but nobody came with vd any more 
And john mortimer ,COMMA the playwright defended us 
So seriously ,COMMA is there a dark side 
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone 
I mean ,COMMA do you think about life balance ?QUESTIONMARK 
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people ,COMMA and therefore extreme responsibility .PERIOD i think goes with that wealth 
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the west ,COMMA get so excited about -- i mean ,COMMA they're used to having an idea getting stuff done .PERIOD and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world 
But i think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how and help governments approach things slightly differently .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA richard ,COMMA when i was starting off in business ,COMMA i knew nothing about it .PERIOD and i also was sort of -- i thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless ,COMMA and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding ,COMMA 
So i would like to thank you for that inspiration ,COMMA and for coming to ted today .PERIOD thank you 
I would say ,COMMA with a great smile ,COMMA i will definitely pass 
He just started asking ,COMMA where did you buy the radio ?QUESTIONMARK how much is it 
And he said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i teach at a college of arts 
It can be ruins ,COMMA or it can be music ,COMMA or it can be painting or drawing or writing ,COMMA whatever it is 
But it is just a kind of trace of that time ,COMMA 
So it took about 24 hours to get this line 
So what we see is just what we think often ,COMMA and most of the time we don't see what it is 
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know ,COMMA this is a work called light makes dark 
This is an exact negative 
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six seven months ,COMMA in the restroom ,COMMA when i was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor 
This is the work i made out of that material .PERIOD 
So i told them i'd like to start an air freshener company ,COMMA 
So i just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object ,COMMA and there 
Because as a visual artist ,COMMA if i'm seeing this ,COMMA and i'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 
It's the same in marketing 
It only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water 
Take bp -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand .PERIOD but then one little accident .PERIOD 
The same is true of marketing 
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force ,COMMA which is ultimately good for your brand 
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- vielle à roue 
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique ,COMMA 
And today ,COMMA the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music ,COMMA dance ,COMMA contemporary and world music -- in the uk in france ,COMMA in spain ,COMMA and in italy ,COMMA 
But the moment you fall in love ,COMMA you become extremely sexually possessive of them .PERIOD 
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving .PERIOD an intense craving to be with a particular person ,COMMA not just sexually ,COMMA but emotionally 
And then the very last question ,COMMA i would ask them -- i would always have to work myself up to this question ,COMMA because i am not a psychologist 
The motor of the brain ,COMMA it's a drive 
And in fact ,COMMA i think it's more powerful than the sex drive .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you can feel it when you're just driving along in your car ,COMMA 
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time ,COMMA thereby conserving mating time and energy 
They've got incredible people skills negotiating skills .PERIOD 
They're highly imaginative 
And -- basic math 
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression 
Indeed ,COMMA arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .PERIOD 
I even think that marriages might even become more stable ,COMMA because of the second great world trend 
It may decline some more 
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated so interesting so capable 
However ,COMMA there's always kinds of complications in this 
In these three brain systems :COLON lust ,COMMA romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together 
But i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate 
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love 
And wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome 
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .PERIOD 
They're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil .PERIOD 
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the big wants -- the big being the organization ,COMMA the system ,COMMA the country -- and what the small wants -- the individual ,COMMA the person 
Charlie ledbetter yesterday ,COMMA i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things 
And that's what i want to talk about today ,COMMA 
319 
I think something happens ,COMMA i think a head may appear in a second 
We showed them the whole cut ,COMMA and they were all completely .PERIOD what is this 
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed ,COMMA all day ,COMMA all you do is look at the roof ,COMMA and it's a really shitty experience .PERIOD 
It's a history of invention based around this 
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and i'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing 
Why do we line up ?QUESTIONMARK the square milk carton with the square fence 
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to 
We don't know why ,COMMA but we do 
So what is this ?QUESTIONMARK i hear you all ask ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA i don't 
So ,COMMA what seems like a very clunky product is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA incredibly useful .PERIOD 
These guys are using this very successfully .PERIOD 
How far you can anticipate ,COMMA what follows from it what are the threats ?QUESTIONMARK what are the possibilities ?QUESTIONMARK the challenges ,COMMA the opportunities 
And all the components are there ,COMMA which are now in common parlance ,COMMA in our vocabulary ,COMMA you know ,COMMA 30-odd years later ,COMMA wind energy .PERIOD recycling ,COMMA biomass solar cells .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA if in that bucky-inspired phrase ,COMMA we draw back and we look at planet earth .PERIOD and we take a kind of typical industrialized society ,COMMA then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings ,COMMA 44 percent ,COMMA transport ,COMMA 34 percent and industry 
If you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example -- and munich is not a bad example of that ,COMMA with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city ,COMMA which is really only twice as dense is only using one-tenth of the energy 
In other words ,COMMA you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous 
How does it affect the design of buildings 
The one example i take is a corporate headquarters for a company called willis and faber in a small market town in the northeast of england ,COMMA commuting distance with london .PERIOD 
This building was wired for change 
In other words ,COMMA we didn't have the technology to do .PERIOD what would be really interesting on that building 
And if i fast-forward in time ,COMMA what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory ,COMMA 
The library of the free university ,COMMA which opened last year is an example of that 
So it's not a kind of sacrifice ,COMMA quite the reverse 
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology ,COMMA the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit to transfer that information now directly into the factory .PERIOD 
For wind tunnels ,COMMA we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air ,COMMA and the many kilometers of cable and so on ,COMMA 
I mean ,COMMA major transformation ,COMMA 
It's been well known that the dead sea is dying 
How do you make them more friendly at that scale ?QUESTIONMARK 
Hong kong ,COMMA i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age ,COMMA because you always have a point of reference .PERIOD 
250 -- excuse me ,COMMA 50000 people working 24 hours ,COMMA seven days 
Contagious is a good word 
Laughter is contagious passion is contagious 
And that directly increased student wellbeing 
And that can't happen in a classroom 
And ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA this program is wonderful 
We have to start collecting from 555 
Kbs ,COMMA so ,COMMA the charter of compassion starts right here 
It was incredible 
Now i was paid in dollars as a consultant ,COMMA and i looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself ,COMMA is there a line in my return ,COMMA which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible 
I tried to convince myself that no no ,COMMA i have worked for the policy changes 
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma ,COMMA because i couldn't live with it any longer 
In fact ,COMMA they invite the honey bees through their colors and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves .PERIOD 
These are the three guiding principles of the honey bee network that whenever we learn something from people ,COMMA it must be shared with them in their language .PERIOD 
You cannot discriminate 
I'm so sorry to say that 
The rice that you ate in the lunch ,COMMA and you will eat today ,COMMA is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture .PERIOD millions of them every season ,COMMA in the paddy season ,COMMA when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water 
And feet in the water will develop fungus ,COMMA infections and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point .PERIOD 
And this is what he got painted 
There could be nothing more wrong than the maslowian model of hierarchy of needs .PERIOD because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA here's a model where a two-wheeler washing machine 
So it is better .PERIOD it is safer .PERIOD it is affordable .PERIOD it is energy-efficient .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ,COMMA 
For example ,COMMA cell phones .PERIOD we have 400 million cellphones in this country .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the eminent model ,COMMA the long-tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books .PERIOD for example ,COMMA having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model 
Look at what he is doing 
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy .PERIOD and freedom and flexibility 
And we have a very vibrant network in china ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world 
I can't change the condition of the road ,COMMA but i can make the cycle run faster .PERIOD 
And this is a donkey cart ,COMMA which they modified 
This is in china .PERIOD this girl needed a breathing apparatus 
There's a whole range of innovations that we have 
A car ,COMMA which runs on compressed air ,COMMA with six paisa per kilometer 
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner as opposed to a one-course meal .PERIOD but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people 
So in an indirect way ,COMMA you can see the sun 
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum 
They created this shade that you can see here which actually covers the sun ,COMMA but opens up to the good light from the sky .PERIOD 
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way 
This is richard kelly who was born 100 years ago ,COMMA which is the reason i bring him up now ,COMMA because it's kind of an anniversary year 
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space ,COMMA and helps you to get around 
These three distinct elements ,COMMA together ,COMMA make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better .PERIOD 
How do they share their culture 
The problem is ,COMMA though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but i can have four of these on my finger ,COMMA so you would not to be able to really see them 
So just to explain 
Why are all these motorways permanently lit 
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness .PERIOD 
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create ,COMMA so they really want to connect with it like here ,COMMA 
Where have they come from ,COMMA where are they going 
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness ,COMMA and the light 
They pointed out that i believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today ,COMMA they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff .PERIOD 
It really was a big idea in technology .PERIOD when we started applying it in the ibot ,COMMA for the disabled community 
The big idea here is ,COMMA i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA in that time ,COMMA 91 percent of america lived either on farms ,COMMA or in small towns 
So the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal .PERIOD it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage 
It all made sense with 91 percent of the people living there 
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air ,COMMA and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices ,COMMA particularly sitting in cities .PERIOD 
I don't look like a motor vehicle 
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter .PERIOD and i don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff 
Then she looks up ,COMMA she's looking up ,COMMA and she says ,COMMA and i'm 81 years old ,COMMA and i don't drive a car anymore .PERIOD 
We need water 
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing ,COMMA with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat ,COMMA then ,COMMA using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for 450 watts ,COMMA which is a little more than half of its waste heat .PERIOD it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool .PERIOD it 
So if we put this box on here ,COMMA in a few years ,COMMA could we have a solution to transportation ,COMMA electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds .PERIOD 
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important .PERIOD we'll typically do it twice .PERIOD once we want to do it .PERIOD first 
And then it's time to do it again ,COMMA last year ,COMMA 
After it falls below a critical price .PERIOD it will tend if it's successful to rise above a critical mass ,COMMA a penetration

This is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails 
Linux is another good example 
Two percent isn't 20 percent .PERIOD but in the car business ,COMMA which is slow moving .PERIOD that's huge .PERIOD that's arrival 
Free is something that comes with digital ,COMMA because the reproduction costs are essentially free .PERIOD it comes with ip because it's such an efficient protocol ,COMMA it comes with fiber optics ,COMMA because there's so much bandwidth 
It's an economic force .PERIOD it's a technical force .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA there could be a film's [unclear] there .PERIOD but it's basically every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage .PERIOD by 2008 .PERIOD it takes that entire element .PERIOD the physical element of songs off the table .PERIOD 
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about 
And by definition ,COMMA every one of you who is in this room ,COMMA must consider yourself a global soul ,COMMA a global citizen ,COMMA 
Even more problematic ,COMMA they're not listening to poor people themselves .PERIOD 
In 2002 ,COMMA i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india ,COMMA who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet 
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market ,COMMA had bypassed low-income farmers altogether ,COMMA despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day 
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers because these systems were both too expensive .PERIOD and they were constructed for fields that were too large 
In fact ,COMMA when you go back to the beginning ,COMMA there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet .PERIOD and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors ,COMMA agriculture ,COMMA 
Secondarily we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .PERIOD 
In arusha ,COMMA tanzania ,COMMA a to z .PERIOD textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with .PERIOD unicef ,COMMA with the global fund to create a factory that now employs 7000 people ,COMMA mostly women 
So that in the terrorist attacks of november ,COMMA they were the first responder ,COMMA and are now beginning to scale because of partnership 
President obama understands that 
It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban .PERIOD 
It was about 115 degrees ,COMMA 
And because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs ,COMMA i made a graph that moves .PERIOD and i talk about the makeup of me 
During the hurricane ,COMMA you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog .PERIOD updating it frequently ,COMMA this was possible ,COMMA because of the easy nature of blogging tools 
They sent a search party .PERIOD and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible .PERIOD peak 
And i won it ,COMMA i reached all of these people ,COMMA and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life ,COMMA everyday 
And then i wrote a post about a banjo 
And my husband -- this is my husband who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me you cannot buy a banjo 
And those people who know me understood my joke 
How much money does he spend on beer in a year 
And then i got people saying leave him 
And why are they reading this 
This is not science .PERIOD but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line 
This is the only picture i have .PERIOD and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs to think about the people who are on those $100 computers talking about who they are sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing 
And -- and so i printed out her -- or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family ,COMMA and they passed it out at her memorial service ,COMMA and even in her obituary ,COMMA they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life .PERIOD 
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design ,COMMA it's powered for ocean swimming 
It flies through the ocean .PERIOD on its pectoral fins ,COMMA gets lift powers its movements with a lunate tail 
This tuna symbolizes what's the problem for all of us in the room 
So take a look at that animal 
So in a program called tag-a-giant ,COMMA we've actually gone from ireland to canada from corsica to spain 
And that's the fisheries off the state of north carolina 
They're coming together that could be tuna sex -- and there it is 
So from data like this ,COMMA we're able now to put the map up .PERIOD and in this map ,COMMA you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging 
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into monterey 
We just need to put it together 
We have the technology that's shown us where it is 
Hi ,COMMA there ,COMMA i'm hasan .PERIOD i'm an artist 
Basically ,COMMA this is the fbi offices in tampa ,COMMA where i spent six months of my life -- back and forth ,COMMA not six months ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA 
Or questions ,COMMA such as -- actually ,COMMA during the polygraph ,COMMA which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was 
And it's like guys ,COMMA i travel a lot 
Don't want to make it look like ,COMMA i'm making any sudden moves 
And so i just kept doing this over and over and over 
Then i'd make websites 
So you can see delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta ,COMMA 
This was on delta 719 going from jfk to san francisco 
These are the airports that i hang out in because i like airports 
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data ,COMMA then you're basically replaying the roll of the fbi agent ,COMMA and putting it all together 
This is exactly where my old apartment in san francisco was 
And then sometimes you get this 
So there's multiple databases 
So there's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations .PERIOD empty gas stations .PERIOD 
At 156 pm was this one at 459 pm was this one 
Every few moments i shoot the image .PERIOD 
So by me ,COMMA putting all this information out there ,COMMA what i'm basically telling you is ,COMMA i'm telling you everything 
And the reason their information has any value is well ,COMMA because no one else has access to it .PERIOD 
And by me ,COMMA cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you ,COMMA the information that the fbi has has no value ,COMMA so thus devaluing their currency 
So in a way i'm glad that i'm completely obsolete 
And you know ,COMMA some of my friends have always said ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you're just paranoid .PERIOD why are you doing this 
So you can see that the homeland security likes to come by -- department of homeland security ,COMMA 
Bruno giussani :COLON hasan just curious 
So it's just become another day .PERIOD 
And everything's automated at the other end .PERIOD 
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage ,COMMA the fbi gets crazy .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it goes to the last point that i was at 
Hasan thank you very much .PERIOD 
You all know the truth of what i'm going to say ,COMMA 
But first see what a miserable lot ,COMMA we are 
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top 
And there you see it in relation to the measure of inequality .PERIOD i've just shown you which i shall use over and over again ,COMMA in the data 
That's very important in poorer countries ,COMMA but not in the rich developed world 
But in the more equal societies ,COMMA it rises to 60 or 65 percent 
This is violence 
There's a about a tenfold difference there ,COMMA log scale up the side 
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison 
Basically it's asking do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons ,COMMA or is there no relationship between the two 
One is that in graph after graph ,COMMA we find the countries that do worse ,COMMA whatever the outcome seem to be the more unequal ones ,COMMA and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries ,COMMA and japan 
It's not just one or two things that go wrong .PERIOD it's most things 
I am not talking about perfect equality .PERIOD i'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies 
It also leads to status insecurity ,COMMA 
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health ,COMMA in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system ,COMMA the cardiovascular system 
Thank you 
Well ,COMMA i didn't have that in mind .PERIOD so 
The acid will ruin the gold plating .PERIOD 
Beneath it is a wonderful knife 
No ,COMMA but is it fun 
So i type design emotion ,COMMA and my website wasn't first again ,COMMA 
It's so much fun to drive 
And then a psychologist alice isen did this wonderful experiment 
So ,COMMA she'd bring people into the room ,COMMA and there'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here .PERIOD 
You get a little problem ,COMMA you say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA i'll figure it out 
There's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain .PERIOD 
Behavioral is subconscious ,COMMA you're unaware of it 
Almost everything we do is subconscious .PERIOD 
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line ,COMMA 
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment 
The other neat thing 
So that's the new me 
The graph was interesting ,COMMA although you need to consider it carefully 
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms 
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools ,COMMA where the score was 30 percent .PERIOD and let's say took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing .PERIOD 
The last question is ,COMMA what everybody said ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office .PERIOD can you show me how to do it ?QUESTIONMARK and then somebody taught him 
He came there ,COMMA and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad 
I left the computer there with lots of cds -- i didn't have any internet -- and came back three months later ,COMMA 
And as soon as they saw me ,COMMA they said we need a faster processor and a better mouse .PERIOD 
So i said ,COMMA but how did you understand what's going on over there ?QUESTIONMARK 
So then i measured ,COMMA and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mispronounced ,COMMA but correct usage -- words like exit ,COMMA stop ,COMMA find save that kind of thing ,COMMA not only to do with the computer ,COMMA but in their day-to-day conversations 
This is the himalayas up in the north ,COMMA very cold .PERIOD 
I want to just cut this short ,COMMA we did this over and over again ,COMMA 
So if they have access to the computer ,COMMA they will teach themselves including intelligence 
But we got a clean learning curve ,COMMA almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school 
I'll leave it at that ,COMMA because i mean ,COMMA it sort of says it all doesn't it 
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital ,COMMA automatic ,COMMA fault-tolerant ,COMMA minimally invasive ,COMMA connected and self-organized 
And it's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage ,COMMA 
I negotiated with saddam's diplomats at the un 
I'd already served in germany ,COMMA norway various other places .PERIOD but i was posted to new york to serve on the un security council for the british delegation 
And there i dealt with things like the middle east ,COMMA peace process .PERIOD the lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later ,COMMA if you wish -- but above all ,COMMA my responsibility was iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons .PERIOD 
I decided to take a sabbatical ,COMMA in fact at the new school bruce 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff 
But in a way ,COMMA i've got used to the sensation of it 
A lot of my friends were still in it 
It was anarchy .PERIOD 
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy ,COMMA to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually can't stop that rampaging mob who's coming down the street 
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process ,COMMA which became known as the final status process of kosovo 
And i came to kosovo and advised the kosovo government 
If they can't do it who's left to deal with it 
So we will be bringing darfuri rebel groups .PERIOD the northern cypriots and the southern cypriots rebels from aceh and awful long ,COMMA laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world .PERIOD 
That is the politics of the 21st century ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA independent diplomat embodies that fragmentation ,COMMA that change that is happening to all of us 
Now today we're not talking about good and bad tv .PERIOD 
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom 
Is television ,COMMA literally functioning as our conscience ,COMMA tempting us and rewarding us at the same time 
We surveyed the top-20 nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows 
Viewers had responded dramatically 
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say my god ,COMMA i can comment on how i feel about the vietnam war about the presidency through television 
It can change us 
That's mapped against the red dot ,COMMA unemployment ,COMMA which is a simple bureau of labor department statistic 
We had the bursting of the tech bubble 
I can vote you off the island 
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive ,COMMA dominant tv ,COMMA mom ,COMMA 
Maude .PERIOD findlay ,COMMA the epitome of the irreverent 1970s ,COMMA who tackled abortion ,COMMA divorce ,COMMA even menopause on tv 
Murphy brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood ,COMMA 
This era's mom ,COMMA bree van de kamp 
So here's the metaphor i'm offering today 
Previous to this time ,COMMA i was very selfish and self-righteous 
And on this higher level ,COMMA he becomes loving and forgiving 
But here's the weirdest place of all war ,COMMA 
I passes insensibly into a we my becomes our and individual faith loses its central importance .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA profane is the opposite of sacred 
It just means ordinary or common 
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness 
I'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind 
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me is the staircase ,COMMA a feature of our evolutionary design 
Or is it a bug ?QUESTIONMARK a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- jill has a stroke ,COMMA and she has this religious experience .PERIOD it's just a mistake .PERIOD 
There's a mutation in the gene ,COMMA and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy 
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens .PERIOD from the defectors ,COMMA the cheaters 
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new .PERIOD superorganisms 
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are 
We're bees we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment ,COMMA 
We unleashed earth-changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort 
What's missing 
And that gives me hope ,COMMA because people are not purely selfish .PERIOD 
Every man is a piece of the continent ,COMMA a part of the main 
Thank you 
There was no more space in the house .PERIOD so i went out to the backyard ,COMMA and without any previous building experience and about 3000 dollars and some recycled materials .PERIOD i built this space 
There was enough space ,COMMA and i had control ,COMMA which was very important 
He won the silver medal for ireland in the 1992 olympics and he trains in this space he trains other people 
Museum quality 
I had requested slides ,COMMA kind of adamantly ,COMMA up till the -- pretty much last few days ,COMMA but was denied access ,COMMA to a slide projector ,COMMA 
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical ,COMMA situated next to each other .PERIOD 
So here's the first door ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you get the message 
This is for a book by metropolis ,COMMA 
When i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it .PERIOD he said ,COMMA no ,COMMA he said ,COMMA he didn't believe it was the end of print 
And also surprisingly ,COMMA it was done in kind of a cheap metal ,COMMA and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders 
And i thought ,COMMA you know what were they thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
Got no way of tracking it ,COMMA so i could be totally wrong 
I don't have the site .PERIOD it's just the piece itself 
I found out that's very true working on this campaign worldwide ,COMMA 
But anyway ,COMMA this is one of the ads i was most pleased with ,COMMA because they were all elaborately art-directed ,COMMA and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer 
In germany ,COMMA they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to ,COMMA because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference 
So i understand their logic ,COMMA i totally disagree with it .PERIOD i think it's a very small-minded approach .PERIOD the world is certainly much more global .PERIOD and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer ,COMMA though we'll never know 
Article on bryan ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in dingbat 
It's kind of horsey type ,COMMA but the texture -- the second plane ,COMMA not quite hitting ,COMMA there was something more enticing ,COMMA if that's the right -- it's not the right word -- but in this cover than time or newsweek 
It did not let up 
There were a lot of orphans made this day .PERIOD and here's a dead body being brought out 
This is my desktop 
This is -- i like found art .PERIOD hand lettering's coming back in a big way .PERIOD and i thought ,COMMA this was a great example of both 
But i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento .PERIOD a few years back 
And i remembered seeing this photograph of my father ,COMMA who was a test pilot .PERIOD and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot ,COMMA they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job 
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about 
Before that ,COMMA obviously technology didn't exist .PERIOD but obviously it did 
But it's still very ,COMMA very productive .PERIOD so i'm attempting to say ,COMMA if we take technology's view of the world ,COMMA what does it want 
And i think once we ask that question ,COMMA we have to go back actually to life ,COMMA because obviously ,COMMA if we keep extending the origins of technology ,COMMA far back ,COMMA i think we come back to life at some point 
Brian farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on earth 
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life 
And the last thing i bring back this nudibranch 
And so the general long-term trends of evolution are roughly these five :COLON ubiquity ,COMMA diversity ,COMMA specialization ,COMMA complexity and socialization .PERIOD now i took that and said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what are the long-term trends in technology 
That we see ,COMMA there's a general hammer ,COMMA and hammers become more and more specific over time .PERIOD 
There's obviously diversity huge numbers of things 
So the major trends in technology ,COMMA evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution .PERIOD the same drives that we see towards ubiquity ,COMMA towards diversity ,COMMA towards socialization ,COMMA towards complexity ,COMMA that is maybe not a big surprise .PERIOD because if we map out say the evolution of armor ,COMMA you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree .PERIOD 
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them 
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom ,COMMA those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made that does not happen in biology 
And when we take that we take this idea of what culture is doing ,COMMA and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating .PERIOD and changing the way in which evolution happens 
So all these steps in evolution are increasing ,COMMA basically ,COMMA the evolution of evolvability 
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking ,COMMA the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game 
And each time we make a new opportunity place ,COMMA we're allowing a platform to make new ones 
That's what technology wants 
I'm going my gosh ,COMMA i had never seen anything like this in my life 
And you walk up to the front of the tank ,COMMA then you realize that these animals all have different personalities ,COMMA some of them would hold their ground .PERIOD others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks .PERIOD and one in particular ,COMMA this amazing animal 
And what i learned in school though was really beneficial 
If you're a wildlife filmmaker ,COMMA and you're going out into the field ,COMMA to film animals especially behavior ,COMMA it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are how they work .PERIOD and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a bit about their behaviors 
So we created a way to find out ,COMMA and i got my first look at that famous beak in action ,COMMA 
And octopus are they live in all the oceans 
And as you go deeper ,COMMA that lovely ,COMMA blue water ,COMMA you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue 
And finally ,COMMA it's a rich lavender ,COMMA and after a couple of thousand feet ,COMMA it's ink black 
But we're just going to zip right past this area ,COMMA this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge ,COMMA which i think is even more extraordinary .PERIOD 
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart ,COMMA creating a rift valley ,COMMA 
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing 
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge .PERIOD 
But encouragingly ,COMMA i've seen just the opposite 
Well ,COMMA how it happened is the local community galvanized 
And these problems are so large and global ,COMMA and it's just overwhelming 
My answer to that is don't look at the big ,COMMA overwhelming issues of the world 
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment like those people changed the health of that bay 
I was afraid of womanhood ,COMMA 
Not that i'm not afraid now ,COMMA but i've learned to pretend 
I've learned to be flexible ,COMMA 
Back in the '50s and '60s ,COMMA when i was growing up ,COMMA little ,COMMA girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft ,COMMA and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be 
Now ,COMMA my mother was different 
And i just ate it up 
Because women are on the ground floor ,COMMA and we know the traditions so ,COMMA well ,COMMA we can bring a different voice to the table 
And then also my family was in chaos ,COMMA and i drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter .PERIOD 
But i feel blessed to be able to work with them 
Two hundred years ago ,COMMA the united states was less than a few percent urbanized 
It's now more than 82 percent 
Now listen to this every week for the foreseeable future ,COMMA until 2050 ,COMMA every week ,COMMA more than a million people are being added to our cities .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA cities despite having this negative aspect to them ,COMMA are also the solution ,COMMA 
So we have this kind of dual nature ,COMMA 
That's the quest 
So here's two questions that i have in my head .PERIOD when i think about this problem 
We use them metaphorically -- the dna of a company ,COMMA the metabolism of a city .PERIOD and so on -- is that just bullshit ,COMMA metaphorical bullshit ,COMMA or is there serious substance to it 
And if that is the case ,COMMA how come that ,COMMA it's very hard to kill a city 
You could drop an atom bomb on a city .PERIOD and 30 years later ,COMMA it's surviving 
This is just a tiny range ,COMMA actually it's us mammals .PERIOD we're one of these 
Rat that's a rat -- could have been you 
We're all pretty much the same 
And you see you're very familiar with this 
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe .PERIOD there's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .PERIOD 
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale 
And you're very familiar with these networks .PERIOD 
And here's the summary of what i'm saying 
Heart rates are slower .PERIOD you live longer diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Here it is ,COMMA which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita ,COMMA unlike biology -- higher wages ,COMMA more super-creative people per capita .PERIOD as you get bigger ,COMMA more patents per capita ,COMMA more crime per capita 
See companies they scale 
There it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning ,COMMA when companies are innovating ,COMMA they scale beautifully 
But you notice i've cheated ,COMMA because i've only gone up to '94 
And i put in front of them ,COMMA an authentic experience ,COMMA that allowed them to learn for themselves 
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful ,COMMA and they know what to do with it .PERIOD 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned ,COMMA and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school ,COMMA and when my father was in school ,COMMA and even when i was in school and to a moment ,COMMA when we have information surplus 
It asked them to create for themselves ,COMMA and it allowed them to fail process ,COMMA learn from 
Ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire 
This is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on tuesday .PERIOD when i asked the students to go to the polls ,COMMA 
There are words that we're truly afraid of 
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .PERIOD 
Regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine .PERIOD not too long ago ,COMMA 
And you can basically see that the richer a country is the older ,COMMA the people are within it 
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA 
In 2010 ,COMMA two workers per retiree in the us 
This is age versus cost of health care ,COMMA 
This video ,COMMA i think gets across the concept that i'm talking about quite dramatically 
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body 
In a child before the age of about six months ,COMMA if they lose their fingertip in an accident ,COMMA they'll re-grow their fingertip .PERIOD 
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials ,COMMA 
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling 
This is a horse .PERIOD the horse is not in pain 
After treatment ,COMMA that's what it looks like .PERIOD 
He chills the dish it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish 
It's the coolest stuff 
In this case at the end of the bypass operation ,COMMA you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure ,COMMA being injected directly into the heart of the patient .PERIOD 
This was a randomized trial 
There go the cells 
Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet .PERIOD but i think very soon will be 
So you could go in ,COMMA you could get your tummy-tuck 
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .PERIOD 
In the united states ,COMMA we've had a somewhat different approach .PERIOD 
But there's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way 
And these tedsters are -- you know ,COMMA as innocent ,COMMA as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists ,COMMA who sort of shape our world 
And what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that 
Well ,COMMA my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions .PERIOD 
What i should tell you -- what i should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little ted talks 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA she calls herself black -- she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her 
Frankly ,COMMA i'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
So many others you see ,COMMA they're just wonderful 
But anyway ,COMMA i should have started by saying ,COMMA just how lucky i feel 
You know ,COMMA i couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl 
You know ,COMMA your parents must be very proud 
The point is ,COMMA i'm happy .PERIOD somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess .PERIOD 
So happy continued success .PERIOD 
Sorry ,COMMA this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything to be here ,COMMA right now .PERIOD 
My name is noraida ,COMMA and i'm just -- i'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you're doing ,COMMA and everything like that .PERIOD 
Actually you could say ,COMMA i grew up in the capital of dominican republic ,COMMA otherwise known as washington heights in new york city .PERIOD 
And i think he's mexican .PERIOD so that's -- honestly ,COMMA that's close enough for me ,COMMA right now .PERIOD so -- i just -- i'm sorry 
Okay ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD so anyway ,COMMA what i was trying to say is that i really love ted 
Like it's -- i can't get over this right now 
So basically ,COMMA like da bomb -- what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers .PERIOD and babies does is ,COMMA basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise .PERIOD and who also happen to be mothers like me ,COMMA 
I come from a multicultural family ,COMMA 
And we were only 11 years old .PERIOD so it was not appropriate 
Although you know it was wonderful 
Well ,COMMA i just wanted to quickly say good evening ,COMMA 
But when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted ,COMMA i said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA first ,COMMA i don't know that you know -- before two years ago ,COMMA you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this ,COMMA because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that ,COMMA as an immigrant ,COMMA i do not have good english skills for speaking 
But that's where we had some problems 
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom 
And i said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA men can be difficult ,COMMA but all women have to get used to that 
So i always teach my kids to respect american ideas ,COMMA but i told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay .PERIOD she is just confused by this american problem .PERIOD 
Thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD i love you 
Finished university .PERIOD education got a medical degree .PERIOD 1986 
But critical poverty ,COMMA this slide is from a presentation .PERIOD i gave not that long ago .PERIOD gapminderorg tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care ,COMMA 
Yes ,COMMA i'm sorry if it upsets some of you ,COMMA but i think you need to see this .PERIOD that's the floor .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because it's scary ,COMMA and it's expensive ,COMMA but we need to have it .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's mike mike comes out from mississippi .PERIOD 
See that's one of the problems we have in nigeria .PERIOD and in africa ,COMMA generally ,COMMA 
It looks like all these americans are here and yes ,COMMA one brit .PERIOD and he's not going to do anything -- he thinks he's british ,COMMA actually ,COMMA and he's actually nigerian .PERIOD i just thought about that 
We eventually got it working is the truth .PERIOD but it was one of these even older than the one .PERIOD you saw 
No ,COMMA yes ,COMMA doesn't matter it worked 
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site ,COMMA 
So that's not new what we're doing is applying this technology to it 
These are members of my graduating class ,COMMA 1986 
And finally ,COMMA i get a call last year ,COMMA and then i have to go up after jj .PERIOD abrams 
Hollywood gathers around power tables and the valley gathers around power tables 
But i'm actually here today to tell a story 
And what he said was ,COMMA he wasn't so much afraid that he might die ,COMMA but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life 
But for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA it was a real change .PERIOD 
I went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers ,COMMA to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources 
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a ted -- brings so many powerful connections ,COMMA or through the world forum ,COMMA on social ,COMMA entrepreneurship ,COMMA that my foundation does at oxford every year 
So in 2003 ,COMMA i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company ,COMMA and i was met with a lot of encouragement .PERIOD 
One of the lines of encouragement that i heard over .PERIOD and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think you're going to come to this town and make movies 
One of these films ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA called north country was actually kind of a box office disaster .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA to me ,COMMA spoke volumes ,COMMA because it's -- the film started about a true-life story about a woman who was harassed ,COMMA sued her employer led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women act and others .PERIOD 
At that point ,COMMA i thought i knew something about global warming ,COMMA 
And we have 10 films in production ,COMMA right now and dozens others in development 
And one thing that i've learned is that there's never one right way to make change 
And i can imagine if we do this ,COMMA the headlines in 10 years might read something like these new aids cases in africa fall to zero us imports its last barrel of oil -- -- israelis and palestinians ,COMMA celebrate 10 years of peaceful .PERIOD coexistence 
And i believe that working together ,COMMA we can make all of these things happen 
The next day all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island ,COMMA where he was going to give a conference to the world's press ,COMMA standing in front of his former prison .PERIOD cell 
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one .PERIOD i wear now 
I've subsequently become an envoy for scotland and hiv 
I tell her story to everyone ,COMMA because she represents one of millions of hiv/aids orphans 
I think that's fair to say ,COMMA it's almost everyone in the hall 
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace 
And their decisions about software coding ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA design terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives .PERIOD 
The reality is that even in democratic societies today we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks 
This is a map of social networks worldwide ,COMMA and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing ,COMMA depending on how you like ,COMMA the way ,COMMA facebook manages its service 
In plain english ,COMMA that means censorship and surveillance of their users ,COMMA 
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Comparable in its own very peculiar way ,COMMA to the achievements of microsoft or google ,COMMA 
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover 
And so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen ,COMMA by talking to victims ,COMMA by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services 
Now organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way ,COMMA as any other business 
And it is this western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime 
And as a consequence of this trade ,COMMA britain alone ,COMMA lost ,COMMA eight billion dollars in revenue 
So ,COMMA what were these guys doing with all the money ?QUESTIONMARK they were making 
Well ,COMMA this is where we come to globalization ,COMMA because that was not just the deregulation of global trade .PERIOD 
This one ,COMMA however ,COMMA is in central british columbia ,COMMA where i photographed it 
What they've done is they've shifted their operations 
People don't smoke as much dope ,COMMA or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession 
And so ,COMMA as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox ,COMMA i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself ,COMMA a very nasty infection .PERIOD 
It's such a large conference 
Mark serfaas .PERIOD it's pretty cool .PERIOD huh ?QUESTIONMARK pursuing happiness 
I mean -- no ,COMMA i mean ,COMMA like in the ted sense 
1860 -- am i good 
And my name ,COMMA and it would tell me ,COMMA and i have to tell you right now .PERIOD this is an unadulterated piece of software .PERIOD this is a real internet browser and this is an actual google site .PERIOD and we're going to test it out live today .PERIOD 
Am i feeling lucky 
Ze frank ,COMMA oh amazing 
Needless to say ,COMMA i was able to leave my job 
Four years later ,COMMA i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people .PERIOD i don't know .PERIOD and it's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
And that was embarrassing 
So the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is incredible .PERIOD this is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it .PERIOD it's just gorgeous 
None of the haikus were written by the same person ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA no line was -- you know ,COMMA each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .PERIOD 
It dances to music .PERIOD lotte reiniger an amazing shadow puppeteer in the '20s ,COMMA that started doing more elaborate things 
Chris ?QUESTIONMARK anderson ?QUESTIONMARK ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD mr .PERIOD ze frank ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA this is 2009 
So i'm going to talk about it 
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely ,COMMA we are related -- hardly any genes of difference ,COMMA very ,COMMA very closely related .PERIOD 
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff about culture or psychology or behavior .PERIOD 
Professor tobias came over from south africa and spoke to university college ,COMMA london 
You've believed it through generations 
So that is what they have done .PERIOD now 
Aaron filler from harvard said ,COMMA isn't it time ?QUESTIONMARK we stopped talking about selective pressures 
He kept it to himself for 30 years 
And at that time ,COMMA it became set in stone ,COMMA the aquatic theory should be dumped with the ufos and the yetis ,COMMA as part of the lunatic fringe of science .PERIOD 
I suggested it and people said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no 
Peals of merry laughter 
That crazy woman she's off again ,COMMA she'll say anything won't .PERIOD she 
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors .PERIOD 
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water 
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with ,COMMA because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs .PERIOD 
There is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs .PERIOD and that is when they are wading through water .PERIOD 
David attenborough thinks it's significant .PERIOD as the possible ,COMMA beginning of our bipedalism 
In the whale ,COMMA it's complete ,COMMA no fat inside at all ,COMMA all in blubber outside 
We can speak 
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver ,COMMA and you can see that ,COMMA compared with gorilla ,COMMA we are halfway to being shaped like a fish 
There is nothing there 
I don't believe it 
There was professor tobias .PERIOD he's come over 
Daniel dennett ,COMMA he's come over 
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing .PERIOD 
I can tell you that ,COMMA in three words 
The textbooks don't mention it 
And it's pretty simple 
Everybody's got one -- all of you 
And so ,COMMA when working as an interaction designer ,COMMA or as an artist ,COMMA who deals with participation -- creating things that live on in ,COMMA or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within 
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards ,COMMA 
When i meet a glacier for the very first time ,COMMA what do i do 
Do i carve a message in the snow 
But really the most satisfying experience ,COMMA i've had is the act of listening ,COMMA which is what we need in any good relationship 
And just as with the wall ,COMMA how i wanted to be more wall-like ,COMMA with this project ,COMMA i'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace 
So ,COMMA how do you do that 
That doesn't move 
Here's my promise to you ,COMMA if you are consistent and do this within three months ,COMMA the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say ,COMMA what do you think 
Now when you approach these animals ,COMMA you need to understand ,COMMA there's a dangerous end to them ,COMMA and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness 
If you had the right information ,COMMA you would have done the right thing 
If they follow protocol ,COMMA they'll pick up the phone and say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA do you have the original 
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read 
So what your letter means ,COMMA i've got to tell you ,COMMA we are all in a party ,COMMA and political officials are the pinatas 
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism ,COMMA 
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another ,COMMA either through the production ,COMMA or the absorption of energy 
Now that's exactly the kind of process that i'm interested in when we're thinking about sustainable materials ,COMMA 
It is able to move around its environment ,COMMA 
It can follow chemical gradients 
It can undergo complex reactions ,COMMA some of which are happily architectural 
Here this is a protocell ,COMMA and it's vigorously shedding this skin 
The protocells can actually move away from the light 
So this is really interesting .PERIOD now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .PERIOD 
This is a river 
The reasons vary state to state ,COMMA but mostly in the details ,COMMA 
But as more people showed up wanting water ,COMMA the folks who were there first got a little concerned ,COMMA and in 1865 montana passed its first water law .PERIOD 
There's another thing happening around the country ,COMMA which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint 
So ,COMMA what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem 
He doesn't lose the water right ?QUESTIONMARK he just chooses to apply that right ,COMMA or some portion of it to the stream ,COMMA instead of to the land 
This guy's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream ,COMMA 
He's by far the happiest man ever measured by science 
Compassion is fun 
Therefore ,COMMA to create the conditions for global compassion ,COMMA all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun .PERIOD 
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good .PERIOD 
And they according to the research ,COMMA make the best business leaders 
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion ,COMMA we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits ,COMMA tones down ,COMMA what i call the excessive self-obsession that's in us .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA creating the conditions for humility ,COMMA 
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self-inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in 
That's one 
The second ingredient is autonomy .PERIOD 
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace ,COMMA 
I found this to be true ,COMMA both on the individual level ,COMMA and at a corporate level 
And what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool 
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst .PERIOD but in fact ,COMMA 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .PERIOD 
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law ,COMMA 
In burundi ,COMMA i walked into a prison ,COMMA and it wasn't a 12-year-old boy ,COMMA it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .PERIOD 
And when i walked up to the prison director ,COMMA i said ,COMMA you've got to let her out 
So the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers ,COMMA but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel ,COMMA because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .PERIOD 
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this 
And the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery or end apartheid .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know there's bars ,COMMA and by the time that vishna was getting bigger ,COMMA which means what gets bigger your head gets bigger .PERIOD 
So he would come to the first bar the second bar ,COMMA and then the third bar ,COMMA and then really slowly move his head ,COMMA so he could fit through and come back .PERIOD third second first ,COMMA and he would grab my pinkie ,COMMA because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit 
And i will do the one thing that i can do 
Thank you 
We were in queens ,COMMA we were building the big big ,COMMA big ,COMMA big building in midtown .PERIOD so we were in the small ,COMMA small ,COMMA small boondocks 
But it's not only that 
In italy ,COMMA in milan ,COMMA especially contemporary .PERIOD art really doesn't have that much of a place 
They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important 
Instead ,COMMA she said ,COMMA no ,COMMA no work and leisure can be together .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the tv dinner of 2001 
I would like ,COMMA instead to talk about how great some designers are 
It's a long story ,COMMA because it started before 2001 ,COMMA and it was called emergency 
So designers ,COMMA sometimes don't do things that are immediately functional ,COMMA but they're functional to our understanding of issues .PERIOD 
This is cindy van den bremen who is a dutch designer ,COMMA that's done this series of capsters 
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight ,COMMA so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror .PERIOD so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self 
Design really looks upon the whole world ,COMMA and it considers the world in all of its different ranges .PERIOD 
And it was really interesting ,COMMA because i was the last speaker .PERIOD and before me ,COMMA there were people that were really talking about luxury ,COMMA and i didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time ,COMMA i felt that i had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality ,COMMA 
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously ,COMMA just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years .PERIOD so i'm not sure anymore .PERIOD what the wavelength is 
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales ,COMMA and therefore really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful 
So africa is a complex continent full of contradictions ,COMMA as you can see 
And i want to tell you that this is my story .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's the story of many of the africans who are here 
And my father said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA listen .PERIOD 
So we went to the school ,COMMA and because we were nobodies ,COMMA and because we didn't have privilege ,COMMA and because my father didn't have the right last name ,COMMA he was treated like dirt 
But the money ran out 
You don't see the blogger .PERIOD you don't see the harvard-educated lawyer ,COMMA the vibrant person ,COMMA you know 
And you didn't know about the windmill .PERIOD you know ,COMMA 
And i was just moved 
So what is to be done 
And this is an example ,COMMA you know ,COMMA blogging is one way of doing that 
So we need to start getting better 
And going back to the point i was trying to make .PERIOD this is the swahili .PERIOD wikipedia 
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in east africa 
So that's a start ,COMMA and we've heard of all their other initiatives .PERIOD 
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms .PERIOD in dc ,COMMA covington ,COMMA and burling ,COMMA six figures 
What are they doing 
Practically i mean ,COMMA when i was a first-year student in law school ,COMMA my mom's business had collapsed ,COMMA so i was supporting her 
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad 
An example .PERIOD this man changed my life 
I said ,COMMA i want to be a lawyer 
And i'm like ,COMMA because i'm here and it's cheap ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA i kind of like pittsburgh 
I was also building something called the copenhagen wheel ,COMMA which is just a really beautiful beautiful electric bike at a lab at mit called senseable city lab .PERIOD 
This is a place where my friend ,COMMA abhishek sen was interning 
And that's his actual photograph .PERIOD 
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia 
But this is not available in parol 
But fundamentally what i believe is that the map behind of me is called ,COMMA basically the map of anemia 
And when i walked in ,COMMA she was already at the table 
And she said ,COMMA i saw your talk live-streamed 
So ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the only thing i could think of to say ,COMMA at that point was ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA me neither 
Why did you bring this up have you lost your mind 
And i said ,COMMA i'm just thinking about it a little bit 
And my life did end when that happened 
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .PERIOD 
The majority of people 
I define vulnerability as emotional risk .PERIOD exposure .PERIOD uncertainty .PERIOD 
I am not a natural .PERIOD vulnerability researcher 
So when i became vulnerability ted ,COMMA like an action ,COMMA figure -- like ninja barbie .PERIOD but i'm vulnerability ted -- i thought i'm going to leave that shame stuff behind ,COMMA because i spent six years studying shame before i really started writing and talking about vulnerability 
But in surviving this last year ,COMMA i was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule ,COMMA but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya .PERIOD 
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around 
Here's why 
I can't wait to tell people this 
The credit goes to the man in the arena ,COMMA whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat 
That's what life is about ,COMMA about daring greatly ,COMMA about being in the arena ,COMMA 
I know your dad never paid attention .PERIOD even when you made cfo ,COMMA 
Shame drives two big tapes -- never good enough .PERIOD and if you can talk it out of that one ,COMMA who do you think you are 
It's uncomfortable ,COMMA but it's adaptive 
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study 
And he said ,COMMA that's convenient 
So i started interviewing men and asking questions 
If you put shame in a petri dish ,COMMA it needs ,COMMA three things to grow exponentially secrecy :COLON silence and judgment .PERIOD 
If you put the same amount of shame in a petri dish and douse it with empathy ,COMMA it can't survive 
And i know it's seductive to stand outside the arena ,COMMA because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself ,COMMA i'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i'm bulletproof .PERIOD and when i'm perfect 
We want you to go in 
So ,COMMA what would be better [than] to use the herring gull in its freedom ,COMMA circling and swooping over the sea ?QUESTIONMARK and [to] use this as a role model 
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a smartbird 
We have to turn it go up and go down 
Bruno giussani :COLON markus :COLON i think that we should fly it once more 
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind .PERIOD 
Today we're reaching not even 10 percent of them 
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan 
It is ourselves we are healing 
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it 
So ,COMMA what is in this video is a surgeon operating ,COMMA and then you see on the other side .PERIOD another patient is getting ready 
And of course ,COMMA one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away .PERIOD what you have as a surplus 
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things 
And then over time ,COMMA we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out 
So we're really comparing apples to apples 
So i want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you 
Dr .PERIOD v :COLON when you grow in spiritual consciousness ,COMMA we identify with all that is in the world ,COMMA so there is no exploitation .PERIOD 
So the question is ,COMMA how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical 
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile 
Now mass is the first thing .PERIOD the second thing that's shape 
Again ,COMMA it's a mobile phone-shaped box ,COMMA and this one can change its shape 
As humans ,COMMA we are social .PERIOD we are empathic .PERIOD and that's great .PERIOD 
So that's very intuitive .PERIOD and that's what we want 
The brown administration ,COMMA and a bunch of my friends ,COMMA basically leveled the energy efficiency of california .PERIOD so it's the same .PERIOD now 30 years later ,COMMA even though our economy has gone up ,COMMA 80 percent per capita 
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on 
It's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .PERIOD 
People are following opportunity into town 
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity ,COMMA not the working slums :COLON they help create prosperity .PERIOD 
These people are valuable as a group 
You look at that lane on the right 
They're doing it through an outlaw thing .PERIOD the informal economy 
And young people in brand new cities ,COMMA they're inventing doing new things in the south 
Climate is a profoundly complex nonlinear system ,COMMA full of runaway positive feedbacks ,COMMA hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points .PERIOD 
We're going to keep being surprised and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones .PERIOD 
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear ,COMMA the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can 
It's interesting say ,COMMA to take a 25-megawatt ,COMMA 25 million watts ,COMMA and you compare it to the standard ,COMMA big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva ,COMMA which is 12 16 billion watts .PERIOD 
These things are way smaller .PERIOD they're much more adaptable .PERIOD 
This is a list of them 
And as those events keep happening ,COMMA we're going to say ,COMMA okay .PERIOD what can we do about that really 
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,COMMA one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas ,COMMA 
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us 
As with bp ,COMMA the hole does get plugged at least temporarily ,COMMA but not before exacting a tremendous price .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future .PERIOD 
The gulf of mexico is a very big ocean 
In other words ,COMMA the ocean is big .PERIOD she can take it 
A new bubble will replace the old one 
Now ,COMMA looking at these images ,COMMA it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation ,COMMA which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of england ,COMMA 
An escape hatch has been reached 
Ok ?QUESTIONMARK dh !EXCLAMATIONMARK oh ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
I'm now pushing my luck .PERIOD i'm skipping right to six cups 
Also three with his left 
Oh ,COMMA it's time for richard's help ,COMMA 
Excuse me ,COMMA could we work on the design of the microphone ?QUESTIONMARK 
Wow ,COMMA you've been working out 
Ok ,COMMA here we go 
There you go 
First one 
What happened there 
Do you want me to hold you or not ?QUESTIONMARK dh :COLON don't hold me that hard 
Just do it juggler boys .PERIOD you say ,COMMA 
Even the pencil 
Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage 
Where's gloria 
Yeah ,COMMA a little sketchy 
What do you want me to do with it 
Nice 
Oh ,COMMA barry .PERIOD is there nothing .PERIOD you can't do 
You are my hero ?QUESTIONMARK you're my jim shea jr .PERIOD 
I do i do 
Please ,COMMA please stay seated stay seated .PERIOD thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane ,COMMA 
One billion people have not enough to eat 
Palm tree plantation in borneo

Woman love love is nice .PERIOD if you can have it 
Eighth man :COLON i had a big laugh today .PERIOD 
Ninth man .PERIOD you see family is .PERIOD it's awful 
My family ?QUESTIONMARK what can i say 
If someday i can achieve something i would like to say thank you ,COMMA daddy and mommy 
If i do like you ,COMMA i give you one cow and many other things ,COMMA and we become friends 
Yab ,COMMA you can also go to the website answer -- respond to the questions ,COMMA also ,COMMA 
Now i am going to speak to you about my movie 
Video this earth is four and a half billion years old .PERIOD 
There is no business on this movie 
Merci beaucoup .PERIOD i love you 
Well ,COMMA we have a whole or team ,COMMA general anesthesia ,COMMA nurses and another doctor across from me 
There will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole 
This was done under local anesthesia as an outpatient .PERIOD 
In the last decade ,COMMA there's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases ,COMMA such as heart disease ,COMMA vascular disease ,COMMA orthopedics ,COMMA tissue engineering ,COMMA even in neurology to treat parkinson's and diabetes .PERIOD 
We've just come out ,COMMA we're commercializing ,COMMA this year generation .PERIOD 20 of the marrow miner .PERIOD 
That was all done on a machine that looks like this 
So now what we do is we take a genome ,COMMA we make maybe 50 copies of it .PERIOD we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads ,COMMA and then we sequence them ,COMMA massively parallel 
And he sequenced he took skin cells ,COMMA healthy skin ,COMMA and cancerous bone marrow ,COMMA and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks .PERIOD no big deal .PERIOD 
And so they were given l-dopa and their symptoms did improve ,COMMA but they weren't totally asymptomatic .PERIOD 
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced 
Thankfully ,COMMA i was able to answer a ,COMMA and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening 
Not hard to imagine my company has software that does this right now 
It can be summed up in a single sentence .PERIOD everything that can happen .PERIOD does 
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced 
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties .PERIOD and have anti-particle partners that carry opposite charges 
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles 
The most important thing to understand here is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces 
A particle that hasn't been seen yet ,COMMA but we're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle ,COMMA which gives masses to all these other particles 
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles 
The most familiar charge is electric charge 
Now ,COMMA it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges :COLON hypercharge and weak charge 
For example .PERIOD this weak force particle ,COMMA and its anti-particle can be created in a collision 
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti-neutrino ,COMMA and these three still add to zero total charge 
So there's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges ,COMMA which is not very symmetric ,COMMA could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the higgs particle breaks ,COMMA the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism 
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in 1973 
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen 
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape .PERIOD 
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new 
In 1623 ,COMMA galileo wrote this nature's grand book ,COMMA which stands continually open to our gaze ,COMMA is written in the language of mathematics ,COMMA 
And of course ,COMMA bad for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA 
In this regard ,COMMA new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies 
As with any large investment ,COMMA it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research .PERIOD when it isn't working out 
I try to balance my life ,COMMA equally between physics ,COMMA love and surfing -- my own three charge directions ,COMMA 
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this e8 pattern could be the rest of the picture 
They are more like us than any other living creature .PERIOD and we've heard about that during this ted conference 
Chimpanzees ,COMMA i believe more than any other living creature ,COMMA have helped us to understand that after all ,COMMA there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom 
There isn't time to go into it ,COMMA but it's including things like tree nurseries ,COMMA methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded ,COMMA almost desert-like land up in these mountains ,COMMA 
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland ,COMMA so that within two years they can again be productive 
Perhaps build some schoolrooms 
And we've got ,COMMA as is the case around the world about 95 percent of all loans returned 
And as a result of this program ,COMMA something's happening for conservation 
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages ,COMMA instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way ,COMMA many of the staff are now tanzanian -- but when we began the tacare program .PERIOD it was a tanzanian team going into the villages 
And everywhere there were these terrible problems 
And you know the kind ,COMMA i'm talking about ,COMMA i'm talking about pollution ,COMMA 
The water -- water is ,COMMA perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural ,COMMA industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world ,COMMA seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience 
In many parts of sub-saharan africa ,COMMA the droughts are so much worse 
Well ,COMMA do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain ,COMMA the kind of brain that the ted technologies exemplify ,COMMA and the human heart talking about it in the non-scientific term ,COMMA in terms of love ,COMMA and compassion ,COMMA is there some disconnect 
We have compromised their future 
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things .PERIOD 
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife ,COMMA domestic animals as well .PERIOD 
You can't come to a conference like ted ,COMMA and not have hope .PERIOD can you 
And i mean ,COMMA think of the technologies 
How many of us have children ,COMMA or grandchildren ,COMMA nieces ,COMMA nephews ,COMMA 
People like this are so inspirational 
And i hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things ,COMMA especially the roots and shoots program 
And it was very ,COMMA very exciting for me to meet her and see ,COMMA just one example of how young people when they are empowered ,COMMA given the opportunity to take action to make the world .PERIOD a better place ,COMMA truly are our hope for tomorrow .PERIOD 
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as tom cruise in minority report .PERIOD the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you 
You can get video annotations of the event that you're reading about .PERIOD you can get the latest sports scores ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
I then in the last few years learned about the pacific garbage patch ,COMMA and the gyre 
And the bigger picture is ,COMMA we need to find a way to turn off the faucet 
It's not just that gyre of plastic that i'm concerned about -- it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket 
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it .PERIOD again ,COMMA 
And i'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source 
But what if it wasn't 
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers 
But i got to thinking ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we were in the middle of a flood zone in bangladesh ,COMMA the water wouldn't look like this 
There we go mind the electrics 
Pop the cartridge out pop a new one in 
About half a cent a day to run 
To put that into context ,COMMA the uk government ,COMMA spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid 
Phyllis rodriguez we are here today ,COMMA because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA it feels natural to us .PERIOD now ,COMMA 
And when i saw it -- and yet through the shock ,COMMA the terrible shock and the terrible explosion in our lives ,COMMA literally ,COMMA we were not vengeful 
I am the mother of zacarias moussaoui 
My son ,COMMA i don't know where he is 
So that's why i decided to tell my story ,COMMA so that my suffering is something positive for other women 
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together 
So if i can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did .PERIOD well ,COMMA this is something good 
I would like to say that i have learned so much from aicha ,COMMA starting with that day ,COMMA we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security ,COMMA because it was november 2002 .PERIOD and ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members 
Why did we want to meet her 
And what happened then is we all told our stories ,COMMA and we all connected as human beings .PERIOD 
I never had met someone with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own 
And these are always periods ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA accompanied by turbulence ,COMMA and all too often by blood .PERIOD 
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation .PERIOD 
It's also moving vertically ,COMMA 
My guess is for what it's worth is that the united states will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered .PERIOD it has radically changed 
But that's not a usual case in history .PERIOD 
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances .PERIOD 
Canning the great british foreign secretary .PERIOD once said ,COMMA britain has a common interest ,COMMA but no common allies 
At that time ,COMMA the defense of my country was about one thing .PERIOD and one thing only how strong was our army ,COMMA how strong was our air force ,COMMA how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies 
But now one final thing 
Collective security is not enough 
Peace has come to northern ireland ,COMMA because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work 
And so suddenly ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages ,COMMA becomes something .PERIOD we have to take seriously ,COMMA as a matter of public policy .PERIOD 
I started with a poem ,COMMA i'll end with one 
For john donne ,COMMA a recommendation of morality 
But if you ask ,COMMA the average american ,COMMA what the optimal formula of longevity is ,COMMA they probably couldn't tell you 
You have the usda food pyramid 
False 
It reminds me of my college days 
So to make it to age 100 you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle .PERIOD you also have to have won the genetic lottery 
That's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person 
And research shows that they would be years ,COMMA largely free of chronic disease ,COMMA heart disease ,COMMA cancer and diabetes .PERIOD 
But the real secret ,COMMA i think lies more in the way that they organize their society 
Just look at the advertisements 
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer ,COMMA big killers here in america 
We're down to one and half ,COMMA right now ,COMMA 
This particular moai ,COMMA these five ladies have been together for 97 years .PERIOD 
And then one day ,COMMA boom ,COMMA we retire 
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways .PERIOD 
They don't have any conveniences 
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does 
They know how to set up their life in the right way .PERIOD so they have the right outlook 
You know ,COMMA the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born because of infant mortality .PERIOD and the year you retire 
And they have strategies to keep from overeating .PERIOD little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time 
And then the foundation of all ,COMMA this is how they connect 
Diets ,COMMA don't work no diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population 
So when i had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity ,COMMA the experience of zero gravity ,COMMA it was incredible 
You can get eight 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how nasa's trained their astronauts for so long ,COMMA 
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now ,COMMA because i don't want to look at me on the screen 
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken ,COMMA until the flavor is just gone 
These micro-machines ,COMMA which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over ,COMMA are self-directed ,COMMA powerful ,COMMA precise ,COMMA accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids ,COMMA 
And so what i'm going to show you is a three-minute reader's ,COMMA digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced .PERIOD it's an ongoing project that's going to go another four or five years 
And each of us has about 100000 of these things running around right now inside each one of your 100 trillion cells ,COMMA 
So no matter how lazy you feel ,COMMA you're not really intrinsically doing .PERIOD nothing 
And three years ago ,COMMA one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible 
I didn't always succeed 
A friend told me ,COMMA shortly after that ,COMMA that she had heard that tim russert ,COMMA a nationally renowned journalist .PERIOD had been talking about me on national tv .PERIOD 
In my country that was the case in 1974 
The women said ,COMMA we agree ,COMMA we'll use pills ,COMMA but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills .PERIOD and we had very ,COMMA very few doctors 
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people ,COMMA you'll find contraceptives in thailand ,COMMA 
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 and the women who organized it said ,COMMA we only want to lend to women who practice family planning 
It's a part of the village development bank .PERIOD it's not a real bank ,COMMA but it's a fund -- microcredit 
And then we thought we'd help america because america's been helping everyone ,COMMA whether they want help or not 
I said ,COMMA don't worry come over ,COMMA and i'll do the whole lot of you 
And what happened 
Then aids came along and hit thailand ,COMMA and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids 
But unfortunately ,COMMA the government was in denial :COLON denial ;SEMICOLON denial .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA mechai ,COMMA could you come and join 
He became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold 
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere everywhere ,COMMA 
And then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection 
We all need to help 
And before you can borrow the money ,COMMA you need to be trained 
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty 
And it's a center ,COMMA a focal point for economic and social development 
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection 
In the last 20 years ,COMMA i have published a few books ,COMMA but i have lived in anonymity until february of 2006 when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy ,COMMA 
That made me a celebrity now people recognize me in macy's .PERIOD and my grandchildren think that i'm cool 
My measurements 
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games 
When asked in a tv interview ,COMMA how could she look so good 
Sophia loren ,COMMA was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than i am ,COMMA not ,COMMA counting the poofy hair 
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive .PERIOD and a few months later ,COMMA she gives birth to premature twins .PERIOD 
Somehow the family survives for 16 months ,COMMA and then ,COMMA by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young american man .PERIOD sasha chanoff who manages to put her in a us rescue plane ,COMMA rose mapendo .PERIOD and her nine children end up in phoenix ,COMMA arizona ,COMMA where they're now living and thriving 
Once when my daughter paula was in her twenties ,COMMA she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on 
Yes ,COMMA for privileged women ,COMMA like my daughter ,COMMA and all of us here today ,COMMA but not for most of our sisters ,COMMA in the rest of the world ,COMMA who are still forced into premature marriage ,COMMA prostitution ,COMMA forced labor -- they have children that they don't want ,COMMA or they cannot feed 
The place is a small women's clinic in a village in bangladesh 
She's not licensed for that .PERIOD she has never done it .PERIOD 
The woman's face looks like a watermelon 
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes 
Jenny is horrified at what she has done ,COMMA but then the translator explains that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation .PERIOD 
They are paid less than men for the same work if they're paid at all ,COMMA and they remain vulnerable ,COMMA because they have no economic independence ,COMMA and they are constantly threatened by exploitation ,COMMA violence and abuse 
In any war today ,COMMA most of the casualties are civilians ,COMMA mainly women and children .PERIOD they are collateral damage .PERIOD 
I'm talking about men with young minds ,COMMA of course ,COMMA 
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed by 2050 
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations .PERIOD it's a grim picture 
So the grain markets were to the south of the city 
But also you have to imagine it full of food 
And if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 ,COMMA you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city ,COMMA like this and be unaware of where your food came from 
It even got built ,COMMA but nothing to do with this vision that howard had 
So i've come up with an alternative ,COMMA which is sitopia ,COMMA from the ancient greek sitos for food ,COMMA and topos for place 
I believe we already live in sitopia ,COMMA 
So if we were to do that ,COMMA what might sitopia look like 
Because without these kinds of people ,COMMA we can't have places like this 
And equally important is the negative version -- don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you 
I sometimes see when i'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead ,COMMA 
And so we have a choice ,COMMA it seems to me 
And also see that it demands acute intelligence ,COMMA not just a gooey feeling 
In this room all this expertise ,COMMA if we joined it all together ,COMMA we could change the world 
Who knew about extension managers 
Now ,COMMA why would i care about rome ,COMMA particularly 
These are just drawings of rome ,COMMA i get back as often as possible -- i need to 
These are sketches of some of the little details 
Here's a little map ,COMMA and i thought of maps at the beginning ,COMMA maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome 
Over the spanish steps ,COMMA we go 
She parks her dirigible ,COMMA lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside .PERIOD 
The text here is right side and upside down ,COMMA so that you are forced to turn the book around ,COMMA and you can see it from ground point of view ,COMMA and from her point of view -- looking in the hole ,COMMA getting a different kind of perspective ,COMMA moving you around the space ,COMMA particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor ,COMMA to the center of the oculus .PERIOD 
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine ,COMMA but keeps on moving ,COMMA because this guy's got a job to do 
Then i thought ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD what am i doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
If i do a foldout page ,COMMA on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it ,COMMA you see behind it .PERIOD what i mean by scar tissue 
Pigeon's progress struck me as a catchy title .PERIOD 
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth ,COMMA along the way 
This is something that's a little bit .PERIOD unusual 
This is one of those things i show to my students because it's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective ,COMMA 
I have all the pieces there's santa maria della pace ,COMMA there's a soccer ball .PERIOD there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening .PERIOD so i had to rethink it 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So there's something super interesting about natural systems ,COMMA 
The first two are the macrobot and decibot 
One of them is the input from the user ,COMMA as you're building your bricks 
So each chain ,COMMA or each element wants to turn ,COMMA right or left 
You're telling each unit if it should turn ,COMMA right or left ,COMMA 
So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional -- up into this chain ,COMMA completely passively 
At the end of the lecture ,COMMA they asked a number of questions ,COMMA but there was one .PERIOD that's really stuck with me since then 
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria at the time ,COMMA 
As we started to look at this information ,COMMA we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before -- no plant animal ,COMMA fungus ,COMMA virus or bacteria .PERIOD 
So can we have the lights off please ?QUESTIONMARK so we can see it 
Well ,COMMA not quite not quite perfect -- you see in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark ,COMMA pitch dark ,COMMA 
That's how big and how dark the universe is 
And that is how un-typical this place is 
Now that is knowledge ,COMMA and if that weren't amazing enough ,COMMA the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time .PERIOD that is the growth of knowledge 
Now ,COMMA how does the solar system -- and our environment in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe 
Well ,COMMA one thing that's true about stephen hawking's remark -- i mean ,COMMA it is true ,COMMA but it's the wrong emphasis one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics .PERIOD there's no special dispensation .PERIOD no miracles involved .PERIOD it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance .PERIOD 
One of them is matter ,COMMA because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing .PERIOD information processing is computation ,COMMA computation requires a computer -- there's no known way of making a computer without matter .PERIOD 
And the same -- well ,COMMA if we could do that ,COMMA we'd automatically have an energy supply ,COMMA because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence 
And with a more powerful telescope ,COMMA you'll be able to see stars and planets 
And locally there ,COMMA you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry .PERIOD and so on .PERIOD 
The danger is not at all unprecedented species ,COMMA go extinct .PERIOD all the time 
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure ,COMMA but that's only if we know what to prevent 
The world is buzzing at the moment ,COMMA with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs .PERIOD 
They're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general ,COMMA 
And that is ,COMMA i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists 
It's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism ,COMMA that of haemophilus influenzae ,COMMA 
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours 
And we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions ,COMMA trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles 
And with doing this ,COMMA we've made some amazing discoveries .PERIOD 
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution 
Transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code 
We found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult 
And there's only two countries the us and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food ,COMMA hopefully a source of energy ,COMMA environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry 
It was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books ,COMMA and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life .PERIOD so it must be .PERIOD ok .PERIOD the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this ,COMMA but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments .PERIOD for the reasons we were doing them 
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us 
In particular check out asia ,COMMA 
Zoom in on haiti ,COMMA in outline here ,COMMA 
But deng xiaoping instinctively understood ,COMMA the importance of offering choices to his people 
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy 
We can go do it over and over again ,COMMA 
We also need the choices for people 
The final thing we need are choices for leaders 
Now when i say that some of you are starting to think ,COMMA well is this just bringing back colonialism .PERIOD 
Let us have a hong kong .PERIOD nearby 
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well 
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule 
So let me show you why that's wrong 
Take this representation of all of the land 
Their kids can get an education 
So ,COMMA what will it take to get started building the first charter cities ,COMMA scaling this ?QUESTIONMARK so we build many more 
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office ,COMMA that people can pledge as collateral .PERIOD

Philip zimbardo :COLON let's tune into the conversation of the principals in adam's temptation .PERIOD 
Come on adam ,COMMA don't be so wishy-washy .PERIOD take a bite .PERIOD i did 
I don't want to get in trouble 
Life is temptation .PERIOD it's all about yielding resisting ,COMMA yes ,COMMA no .PERIOD now ,COMMA later ,COMMA impulsive ,COMMA reflective ,COMMA present ,COMMA focus and future .PERIOD focus 
What determines any decision you make 
You can focus on past-positive or past-negative 
And moderate on present-hedonism ,COMMA 
They sacrifice family time .PERIOD they sacrifice friend time 
I'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters 
Told me ,COMMA don't eat that marshmallow .PERIOD because if you wait you're going to get two of them ,COMMA until i learned to balance out 
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this ,COMMA there's saturn ,COMMA and we have been to saturn before -- we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years ,COMMA glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA just studying the rings alone ,COMMA we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral .PERIOD galaxies 
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan ,COMMA get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles 
Try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like ,COMMA 
It's cold ,COMMA it's eerie ,COMMA it's misty ,COMMA it might be raining .PERIOD and you might be standing on the shores of lake ,COMMA michigan ,COMMA brimming with paint thinner ,COMMA 
As i said ,COMMA it has a thick extensive atmosphere 
We have instruments on cassini ,COMMA which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere .PERIOD and my camera system is one of them 
They look like ,COMMA they've been pulled apart 
So it was -- i mean ,COMMA i'm getting goose bumps just talking about it 
But this is somewhat of a shoreline ,COMMA 
And obviously ,COMMA it landed in one of these flat ,COMMA dark regions ,COMMA and it didn't sink out of sight .PERIOD so it wasn't fluid ,COMMA that we landed in 
And it's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw ,COMMA and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .PERIOD 
And i think you would agree that we have found .PERIOD titan is a remarkable ,COMMA mystical place .PERIOD it's exotic .PERIOD it's alien .PERIOD but yet strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity ,COMMA and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself .PERIOD 
It is a very geologically active body 
Or this 
Really 
We're having trouble feeding six billion today ,COMMA 
When we look at a map of los angeles ,COMMA or london ,COMMA it is hard to believe that as of 2005 only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail ,COMMA 
At google ,COMMA 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120000 kilometers of roads .PERIOD 3000 hospitals ,COMMA logistics and relief ,COMMA points ,COMMA 
Nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land 
Welcome to the new world 
When i travel with my work across europe and the united states ,COMMA one question always comes up ,COMMA where is the palestinian gandhi 
Israeli soldier a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [unclear] .PERIOD 
Julia bacha ,COMMA when i first heard about the story of budrus ,COMMA i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003 
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .PERIOD 
A week later ,COMMA they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .PERIOD 
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it 
So beyond spatial memory ,COMMA if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain ,COMMA we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding ,COMMA for example ,COMMA 
Or better ,COMMA how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions 
Why how what 
We say ,COMMA what we do ,COMMA we say how we're different or how we're better ,COMMA and we expect some sort of a behavior .PERIOD a purchase a vote ,COMMA something like that 
All i did was reverse .PERIOD the order of the information 
In other words ,COMMA when we communicate from the outside in ,COMMA yes ,COMMA people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures 
When we can communicate from the inside out ,COMMA we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior ,COMMA and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do 
And samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success .PERIOD

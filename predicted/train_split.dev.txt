I thought stem cells were a good option ,COMMA but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet .PERIOD 
I officially took a break from singing ,COMMA and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years ,COMMA for transplant .PERIOD 
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon ,COMMA and I asked him if I needed a transplant ,COMMA what I could do to prepare .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Be happy .PERIOD 
It was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius .PERIOD 
I still didn't want a transplant ,COMMA but in a month ,COMMA I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles -DASH -DASH very attractive .PERIOD 
I finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice .PERIOD 
It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match .PERIOD 
But the next morning ,COMMA while I was still in the hospital ,COMMA I got a telephone call .PERIOD 
It was my doctor in Cleveland ,COMMA Marie Budev .PERIOD 
And they had lungs .PERIOD 
They were from Texas .PERIOD 
And everybody was really happy for me ,COMMA but me .PERIOD 
I flew to Cleveland ,COMMA and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye .PERIOD 
But organs don't wait ,COMMA and I went into surgery before I could say goodbye .PERIOD 
The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket ,COMMA telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again ,COMMA and to please try and save my voice .PERIOD 
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world .PERIOD 
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery ,COMMA I flatlined twice ,COMMA <NUM> quarts of blood were infused into my body .PERIOD 
And in my surgeon's 20-year career ,COMMA he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed .PERIOD 
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it .PERIOD 
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .PERIOD 
I had hoped my voice would be saved ,COMMA but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it .PERIOD 
So my doctor got the ENT ,COMMA the top guy at the clinic ,COMMA to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box .PERIOD 
He said it would kill me .PERIOD 
So my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice .PERIOD 
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery ,COMMA she didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed .PERIOD 
And if you want an example of perseverance ,COMMA grit and strength in a beautiful ,COMMA little package ,COMMA it is her .PERIOD 
One year ago to this very day ,COMMA I woke up .PERIOD 
I was <NUM> lbs .PERIOD 
It's about living .PERIOD 
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition .PERIOD 
And when people are allowed to pursue their passions ,COMMA doctors will find they have better ,COMMA happier and healthier patients .PERIOD 
My parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place ,COMMA but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time .PERIOD 
And I'm so grateful they did .PERIOD 
This past summer ,COMMA when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies ,COMMA I couldn't help but think of that doctor who told me that I couldn't sing .PERIOD 
And I wanted to tell her ,COMMA and I want to tell you ,COMMA we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams .PERIOD 
When we do ,COMMA we will find that patients don't just survive ;SEMICOLON we thrive .PERIOD 
And some of us might even sing .PERIOD 
[Singing :COLON French] Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And I'd like to thank my pianist ,COMMA Monica Lee .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Let's talk trash .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II .PERIOD 
After the war ,COMMA we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime .PERIOD 
Mental note to the liberators :COLON throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade .PERIOD 
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest .PERIOD 
Plastics are also hard to recycle .PERIOD 
It's diddly-point-squat .PERIOD 
That's the percentage we recycle .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA melting point has a lot to do with this .PERIOD 
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .PERIOD 
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .PERIOD 
Half of each year's <NUM> billion points of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .PERIOD 
A large ,COMMA unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea .PERIOD 
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A .PERIOD airport .PERIOD 
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .PERIOD 
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes ,COMMA here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan ,COMMA who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .PERIOD 
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California .PERIOD 
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate ,COMMA PET ,COMMA will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic ,COMMA polypropylene .PERIOD 
They will float in seawater ,COMMA but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .PERIOD 
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo .PERIOD 
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific ,COMMA while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas .PERIOD 
After ten years ,COMMA a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch ,COMMA while ours litter the Philippines .PERIOD 
After <NUM> years ,COMMA we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre .PERIOD 
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks .PERIOD 
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish ,COMMA like cigarette lighters .. .PERIOD 
but ,COMMA mostly bottle caps .PERIOD 
Sadly ,COMMA their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .PERIOD 
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .PERIOD 
This is Mae West ,COMMA still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans .PERIOD 
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem ,COMMA so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in <NUM> I went to the Long Beach Peninsula ,COMMA at the east end of our long beach .PERIOD 
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .PERIOD 
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .PERIOD 
I got plenty of takers .PERIOD 
Here are the <NUM> bottle caps they collected .PERIOD 
I thought I would spend <NUM> bucks .PERIOD 
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro .PERIOD 
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display .PERIOD 
In spite of my girly man hat ,COMMA crocheted from plastic shopping bags ,COMMA they shook my hand .PERIOD 
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton .PERIOD 
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .PERIOD 
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this .PERIOD 
And this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?QUESTIONMARK 
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes ,COMMA from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .PERIOD 
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .PERIOD 
We did hundreds of necropsies ,COMMA and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .PERIOD 
The record-holder ,COMMA only two-and-a-half inches long ,COMMA had <NUM> pieces in its tiny stomach .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you can buy certified organic produce .PERIOD 
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .PERIOD 
The throwaway society cannot be contained -DASH -DASH it has gone global .PERIOD 
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .PERIOD 
We have to throw it away .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the market can do a lot for us ,COMMA but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken .PERIOD 
All the king's horses and all the king's men .. .PERIOD 
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON The levels are increasing ,COMMA the amount of packaging is increasing ,COMMA the throwaway concept of living is proliferating ,COMMA and it's showing up in the ocean .PERIOD 
Anchor :COLON He offers no hope of cleaning it up .PERIOD 
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process .PERIOD 
The solution ,COMMA Moore says ,COMMA is to stop the plastic at its source :COLON stop it on land before it falls in the ocean .PERIOD 
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world ,COMMA he doesn't hold out much hope for that ,COMMA either .PERIOD 
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline ,COMMA in Long Beach ,COMMA California .PERIOD 
Charles Moore :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
The north coast of California has rainforests -DASH -DASH temperate rainforests -DASH -DASH where it can rain more than <NUM> inches a year .PERIOD 
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree .PERIOD 
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens .PERIOD 
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> stories tall .PERIOD 
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan .PERIOD 
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings ,COMMA and ,COMMA in any case ,COMMA the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow .PERIOD 
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps <NUM> years old -DASH -DASH roughly the age of the Parthenon -DASH -DASH although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that .PERIOD 
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods .PERIOD It's here ,COMMA in red .PERIOD 
The largest individuals of this species ,COMMA the dreadnoughts of their kind ,COMMA live just on the north coast of California ,COMMA where the rain is really intense .PERIOD 
In recent historic times ,COMMA about <NUM> percent of the Coast Redwood forest was cut down ,COMMA especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging ,COMMA clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s .PERIOD 
Even so ,COMMA about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact ,COMMA wild and now protected -DASH -DASH entirely protected -DASH -DASH in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of California ,COMMA including Redwood National Park .PERIOD 
But curiously ,COMMA Redwood rainforests ,COMMA the fragments that we have left ,COMMA to this day remain under-explored .PERIOD 
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through ,COMMA and even today ,COMMA individual trees are being discovered that have never been seen before ,COMMA including ,COMMA in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA Hyperion ,COMMA the world's tallest tree .PERIOD 
I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment .PERIOD 
I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA Chris ,COMMA if I could have you up here ?QUESTIONMARK I have a tape measure .PERIOD 
It's a kind loaner from TED .PERIOD 
And Chris ,COMMA if you could take the end of that tape measure ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're going to show you what the diameter at breast height of a big Redwood is .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA this tape isn't long enough -DASH -DASH it's only a 25-foot tape .PERIOD 
Chris ,COMMA could you extend your arm out that way ?QUESTIONMARK There we go .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
And maybe about here ,COMMA about <NUM> feet ,COMMA is the diameter of a big Redwood .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let your imagination go upward into space .PERIOD 
Think about this tree ,COMMA rising upward into Redwood space ,COMMA <NUM> feet ,COMMA <NUM> stories ,COMMA an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time .PERIOD 
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time :COLON not human time ,COMMA but what we might call Redwood time .PERIOD 
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time .PERIOD 
To us ,COMMA when we look at a Redwood tree ,COMMA it seems to be motionless and still ,COMMA and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion ,COMMA moving upward into space ,COMMA articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time ,COMMA over thousands of years .PERIOD 
Plant this small seed ,COMMA wait <NUM> years ,COMMA and you get this :COLON the Lost Monarch .PERIOD 
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast ,COMMA and was discovered in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA when you look at the base of a Redwood tree ,COMMA you're not seeing the organism .PERIOD 
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant ,COMMA and most of the organism is overhead ,COMMA unseen .PERIOD 
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers of the Redwood forest canopy .PERIOD They're world-class athletes ,COMMA and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists .PERIOD 
Steve Sillett ,COMMA when he was a 19-year-old college student at Reed College ,COMMA had heard that the Redwood forest canopy is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert .PERIOD 
That is to say ,COMMA at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees .PERIOD 
And with a friend of his ,COMMA he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there .PERIOD 
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood ,COMMA and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands ,COMMA and ended up hanging ,COMMA like catching a bar of a trapeze .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA from there ,COMMA he climbed directly up the bark until he got to the top of the tree .PERIOD 
Neither one of them had noticed that there was a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into .PERIOD 
And when Marwood made the jump ,COMMA he was covered with wasps stinging him in the face and eyes .PERIOD He nearly let go .PERIOD 
He would have fallen to his death ,COMMA being <NUM> feet above the ground .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I had been working on other topics :COLON the emergence of infectious diseases ,COMMA which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth ,COMMA make a trans-species jump ,COMMA and get into humans .PERIOD 
After three books on this ,COMMA it got to be a bit much ,COMMA in a way .PERIOD 
My wife and I adore our children .PERIOD 
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them ,COMMA using the so-called arborist climbing technique ,COMMA with ropes .PERIOD You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree .PERIOD 
They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do .PERIOD 
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of that are afraid of heights .PERIOD 
All other primates ,COMMA when they're scared ,COMMA they run up a tree ,COMMA where they feel safe .PERIOD 
We camped overnight in the trees ,COMMA in tree boats .PERIOD 
This is my daughter Laura ,COMMA then <NUM> ,COMMA looking out of a tree boat .PERIOD 
She's ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA tied in with a rope so she can't fall .PERIOD 
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong coming in three dimensions around us .PERIOD 
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels ,COMMA who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are because they've never seen them in the canopy before .PERIOD 
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking ,COMMA where you can move from tree to tree through space ,COMMA rather like Spiderman .PERIOD 
It became a writing project .PERIOD 
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood ,COMMA he fires an arrow ,COMMA which trails a fishing line ,COMMA which gets over a branch in the tree ,COMMA and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line .PERIOD 
There are two people climbing this tree ,COMMA Gaya ,COMMA which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods .PERIOD There they are .PERIOD 
They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree .PERIOD 
You do feel a sense of exposure .PERIOD 
There is a small person right down there on the ground .PERIOD 
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood .PERIOD 
But then you enter the Redwood canopy ,COMMA and it's like coming through a layer of clouds .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA you lose sight of the ground ,COMMA and you also lose sight of the sky ,COMMA and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil ,COMMA which is populated with all kinds of small organisms .PERIOD 
There are epiphytes ,COMMA plants that grow on trees .PERIOD 
These are huckleberry bushes .PERIOD 
Many species of mosses ,COMMA and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree .PERIOD 
When you get near the top of the tree ,COMMA you feel like you can't fall -DASH -DASH in fact ,COMMA it's difficult to move .PERIOD 
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded with living things that don't occur near the ground .PERIOD 
It's like scuba diving into a coral reef ,COMMA except you're going upward instead of downward .PERIOD 
And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top .PERIOD 
Maria's sitting on one of them .PERIOD 
These limbs could be five to six hundred years old .PERIOD 
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops .PERIOD 
They also have a feature :COLON thickets of huckleberry bushes that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees that are technically known as huckleberry afros ,COMMA and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting .PERIOD 
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration .PERIOD 
A Redwood is a fractal .PERIOD And as they put out limbs ,COMMA the limbs burst into small trees ,COMMA copies of the Redwood .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here we see a reiteration in Chronos ,COMMA one of the older Redwoods .PERIOD 
This reiteration is a huge flying buttress that comes out the tree itself .PERIOD 
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree .PERIOD 
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods .PERIOD 
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River ,COMMA and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos .PERIOD 
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar ,COMMA made by Steve Sillett ,COMMA Marie Antoine and their colleagues ,COMMA gives you an idea .PERIOD 
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal ,COMMA of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks .PERIOD 
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale .PERIOD 
There's the person ,COMMA right there .PERIOD The person is waving to us .PERIOD 
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to .PERIOD 
And if we were able to reiterate ,COMMA then the fingers of our hand would be people who looked like us ,COMMA and they would have people on their hands and so on .PERIOD 
And if we had Redwood-like biology ,COMMA we would have six layers of people on our hands ,COMMA as it were .PERIOD 
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our reiterations wave at the same time .PERIOD 
To reiterate the point ,COMMA let's go closer into Iluvatar .PERIOD 
We're looking at that yellow box .PERIOD 
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you -DASH -DASH everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar .PERIOD 
These are millennial structures -DASH -DASH portions of the tree that are believed to be more than <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
There are four humans in this shot -DASH -DASH one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD 
This is a flying buttress .PERIOD 
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space ,COMMA and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk ,COMMA going back into the main trunk and fusing with it .PERIOD 
Flying buttresses ,COMMA just as in a cathedral ,COMMA help strengthen the crown of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time .PERIOD 
They've wired them like patients in an ICU .PERIOD 
They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks ,COMMA possibly all the way into their root systems .PERIOD 
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself .PERIOD 
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting ,COMMA the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart .PERIOD 
If we had Redwood-like biology ,COMMA if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off .PERIOD 
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep ,COMMA hundreds of feet above the ground ,COMMA and there are organisms in this soil that have ,COMMA as yet ,COMMA no names .PERIOD 
This is an unnamed species of copepod .PERIOD A copepod is a crustacean .PERIOD 
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans ,COMMA and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales .PERIOD 
What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil hundreds of feet above the ocean ,COMMA or how they got there ,COMMA is completely unknown .PERIOD 
There are some interesting theories that ,COMMA if I had time ,COMMA I would tell you about .PERIOD 
But as you go and you look closer at a tree ,COMMA what you see is ,COMMA you see increasing complexity .PERIOD 
Gaya may be <NUM> to <NUM> years old ,COMMA no one really knows ,COMMA but its top has broken off and it's been rotting back now .PERIOD 
This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took <NUM> years to form in its complexity that we see right now .PERIOD 
As you look at a tree ,COMMA it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree .PERIOD 
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad at the conclusion of this talk .PERIOD 
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East .PERIOD 
And we're moving in a full circle now .PERIOD 
In the 1950s ,COMMA a small organism appeared in Richmond ,COMMA Virginia ,COMMA called the Hemlock woolly adelgid .PERIOD 
It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia ,COMMA where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia .PERIOD 
When it moved into its new host ,COMMA the Eastern Hemlock tree ,COMMA it escaped its predators ,COMMA and the new tree had no resistance to it .PERIOD 
The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River .PERIOD 
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east ,COMMA but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park it can rain up to <NUM> inches of rain a year .PERIOD 
And in the last two to three summers ,COMMA these invasive organisms ,COMMA this kind of Ebola of the trees ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east ,COMMA and has absolutely wiped it out .PERIOD I climbed there this past summer .PERIOD 
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park ,COMMA and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see .PERIOD 
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death of the Eastern Hemlock species -DASH -DASH that is to say ,COMMA its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite -DASH -DASH but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem for which these trees are merely the substrate for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns .PERIOD 
It's absolutely heartbreaking to see .PERIOD 
One of the things that is just -DASH -DASH I almost can't conceive it -DASH -DASH is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all ,COMMA and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I think they can tell us something about human time .PERIOD 
But we're different from trees ,COMMA and they can also teach us something about ourselves in the differences that we have .PERIOD 
We are human ,COMMA and we have the capacity to love ,COMMA we have the capacity to wonder ,COMMA and we have a sort of boundless curiosity ,COMMA a restless inquisitiveness that so suits us as primates ,COMMA I think .PERIOD 
And at least for me ,COMMA personally ,COMMA the trees have taught me an entirely new way of loving my children .PERIOD 
Exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON I think at a previous TED ,COMMA I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that because these trees are like ,COMMA <NUM> years and older ,COMMA on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species that are not found anywhere on the Earth except on that one tree .PERIOD Is that correct ?QUESTIONMARK 
Richard Preston :COLON Yes ,COMMA that is correct .PERIOD I mentioned Hyperion ,COMMA the world's tallest tree .PERIOD 
And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it ,COMMA in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And while we were climbing Hyperion ,COMMA Marie Antoine spotted an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk .PERIOD 
Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees ,COMMA curiously enough ,COMMA and we wondered whether this ant ,COMMA this species of ant ,COMMA was only endemic to that one tree ,COMMA or possibly to that grove .PERIOD 
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again ,COMMA and so no specimens have ever been collected .PERIOD 
We don't know what it is -DASH -DASH we just know it's there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you have to wonder when ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth ,COMMA you know ,COMMA our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip .PERIOD 
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening ,COMMA and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever .PERIOD 
It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me ,COMMA and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is .PERIOD 
It is fragile ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA I think about emerging human diseases -DASH -DASH parasites that move into the human species .PERIOD 
Caused by humans .PERIOD Caused by the movement of humans .PERIOD 
You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace ,COMMA and the continents are rooms in the palace ,COMMA and the islands are small rooms .PERIOD 
But lately ,COMMA the doors of the palace have been flung open ,COMMA and the walls are coming down .PERIOD 
Richard Preston ,COMMA thank you very much ,COMMA I think .PERIOD 
I love the Internet .PERIOD 
It's true .PERIOD 
Think about everything it has brought us .PERIOD 
Think about all the services we use ,COMMA all the connectivity ,COMMA all the entertainment ,COMMA all the business ,COMMA all the commerce .PERIOD 
And it's happening during our lifetimes .PERIOD 
I'm pretty sure that one day we'll be writing history books hundreds of years from now .PERIOD This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online ,COMMA the generation that built something really and truly global .PERIOD 
But yes ,COMMA it's also true that the Internet has problems ,COMMA very serious problems ,COMMA problems with security and problems with privacy .PERIOD 
I've spent my career fighting these problems .PERIOD 
So let me show you something .PERIOD 
This here is Brain .PERIOD 
This is a floppy disk -DASH -DASH five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A .PERIOD 
It's the first virus we ever found for PC computers .PERIOD 
And we actually know where Brain came from .PERIOD 
Let's take a look .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD 
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy ,COMMA and if we take a closer look inside ,COMMA we'll see that right there ,COMMA it says ,COMMA Welcome to the dungeon .PERIOD 
And then it continues ,COMMA saying ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA Basit and Amjad .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now it's <NUM> .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
The PC virus problem is <NUM> years old now .PERIOD 
So let's see ,COMMA here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan .PERIOD 
This is from the city of Lahore ,COMMA which is around <NUM> kilometers south from Abbottabad ,COMMA where Bin Laden was caught .PERIOD 
Here's a typical street view .PERIOD 
And here's the street or road leading to this building ,COMMA which is <NUM> Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town .PERIOD 
Basit and Amjad ;SEMICOLON they are still there .PERIOD 
So here standing up is Basit .PERIOD 
Sitting down is his brother Amjad .PERIOD 
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .PERIOD 
Now of course ,COMMA we had a very interesting discussion .PERIOD 
I asked them why .PERIOD 
I asked them how they feel about what they started .PERIOD 
And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years .PERIOD 
So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more .PERIOD 
So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like .PERIOD 
What I'm running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer .PERIOD 
So let me just mount some drives .PERIOD Go over there .PERIOD 
What we have here is a list of old viruses .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA let's go with the Centipede virus first .PERIOD 
And you can see at the top of the screen ,COMMA there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one .PERIOD 
You know that you're infected because it actually shows up .PERIOD 
Here's another one .PERIOD This is the virus called Crash ,COMMA invented in Russia in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And the last example ,COMMA guess what the Walker virus does ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes ,COMMA there's a guy walking across your screen once you get infected .PERIOD 
So it used to be fairly easy to know that you're infected by a virus ,COMMA when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA viruses are a global problem .PERIOD 
What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs ,COMMA where we track virus infections worldwide .PERIOD 
So we can actually see in real time that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web ,COMMA we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses ,COMMA how many new examples of malware we find every single day .PERIOD 
Here's the latest virus we've found ,COMMA in a file called Server.exe .PERIOD 
And we found it right over here three seconds ago -DASH -DASH the previous one ,COMMA six seconds ago .PERIOD 
And if we just scroll around ,COMMA it's just massive .PERIOD 
We find tens of thousands ,COMMA even hundreds of thousands .PERIOD 
And that's the last <NUM> minutes of malware every single day .PERIOD 
So where are all these coming from then ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well today ,COMMA it's the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses .PERIOD 
It's gangs like -DASH -DASH let's go to GangstaBucks.com .PERIOD 
This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers .PERIOD 
So if you are a virus writer and you're capable of infecting Windows computers ,COMMA but you don't know what to do with them ,COMMA you can sell those infected computers -DASH -DASH somebody else's computers -DASH -DASH to these guys .PERIOD 
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers .PERIOD 
So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well there's multiple different ways ,COMMA such as banking trojans ,COMMA which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking ,COMMA or keyloggers .PERIOD 
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer ,COMMA hidden from view ,COMMA and they record everything you type .PERIOD 
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches .PERIOD 
Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals .PERIOD 
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals .PERIOD 
Same thing with every single password and so on .PERIOD 
But the thing that they're actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store .PERIOD 
Because when you do purchases in online stores ,COMMA you will be typing in your name ,COMMA the delivery address ,COMMA your credit card number and the credit card security codes .PERIOD 
And here's an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago .PERIOD 
That's the credit card number ,COMMA that's the expiration date ,COMMA that's the security code ,COMMA and that's the name of the owner of the card .PERIOD 
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information ,COMMA you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA is a problem .PERIOD 
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime .PERIOD 
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations :COLON we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons .PERIOD 
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U. ,COMMA a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions .PERIOD 
They are both right now on the run .PERIOD 
Nobody knows where they are .PERIOD 
U.S .PERIOD officials ,COMMA just a couple of weeks ago ,COMMA froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr .PERIOD Jain ,COMMA and that bank account had <NUM> million U.S .PERIOD dollars on it .PERIOD 
So the amount of money online crime generates is significant .PERIOD 
And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks .PERIOD 
We know that online criminals are hiring programmers ,COMMA hiring testing people ,COMMA testing their code ,COMMA having back-end systems with SQL databases .PERIOD 
And they can afford to watch how we work -DASH -DASH like how security people work -DASH -DASH and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .PERIOD 
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA the Internet is international .PERIOD 
That's why we call it the Internet .PERIOD 
And if you just go and take a look at what's happening in the online world ,COMMA here's a video built by Clarified Networks ,COMMA which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world .PERIOD 
This operation ,COMMA believed to be originally from Estonia ,COMMA moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down .PERIOD 
So you just can't shut these guys down .PERIOD 
They will switch from one country to another ,COMMA from one jurisdiction to another -DASH -DASH moving around the world ,COMMA using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this .PERIOD 
So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world .PERIOD 
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you actually track them down ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let me give you an example .PERIOD 
What we have here is one exploit file .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file ,COMMA which contains an exploit .PERIOD 
And that basically means ,COMMA if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer ,COMMA it actually takes over your computer and runs code .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you'll take a look at this image file -DASH -DASH well there's the image header ,COMMA and there the actual code of the attack starts .PERIOD 
And that code has been encrypted ,COMMA so let's decrypt it .PERIOD 
It has been encrypted with XOR function <NUM> .PERIOD 
You just have to believe me ,COMMA it is ,COMMA it is .PERIOD 
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it .PERIOD 
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted .PERIOD 
And I know ,COMMA it doesn't really look much different from the original .PERIOD 
But just keep staring at it .PERIOD 
You'll actually see that down here you can see a Web address :COLON unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .PERIOD 
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer .PERIOD 
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .PERIOD 
And I was looking at that ,COMMA trying to figure out what it means .PERIOD 
So obviously I Googled for it .PERIOD 
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs ,COMMA and one of them mentioned ,COMMA well ,COMMA it ends in RUS like Russia .PERIOD 
And <NUM> is the city code for the city of St .PERIOD Petersburg .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that .PERIOD 
So I went looking for contacts in St .PERIOD Petersburg ,COMMA and through a long road ,COMMA we eventually found this one particular website .PERIOD 
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website ,COMMA and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal .PERIOD 
And he drives a very nice car .PERIOD 
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St .PERIOD Petersburg .PERIOD 
How do I know about this car ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because he blogged about the car .PERIOD 
He actually had a car accident .PERIOD 
In downtown St .PERIOD Petersburg ,COMMA he actually crashed his car into another car .PERIOD 
And he put blogged images about the car accident -DASH -DASH that's his Mercedes -DASH -DASH right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into .PERIOD 
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS .PERIOD 
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture ,COMMA you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS .PERIOD 
Now I'm not a lawyer ,COMMA but if I would be ,COMMA this is where I would say ,COMMA I rest my case .PERIOD 
So what happens when online criminals are caught ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well in most cases it never gets this far .PERIOD 
And even if we are able to find online criminals ,COMMA quite often there is no outcome .PERIOD 
The local police don't act ,COMMA or if they do ,COMMA there's not enough evidence ,COMMA or for some reason we can't take them down .PERIOD 
I wish it would be easier ;SEMICOLON unfortunately it isn't .PERIOD 
But things are also changing at a very rapid pace .PERIOD 
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet .PERIOD 
So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these .PERIOD 
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC ,COMMA programmable logic [controller] .PERIOD 
And this is what runs our infrastructure .PERIOD 
This is what runs everything around us .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these .PERIOD 
And when Stuxnet infects one of these ,COMMA that's a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about .PERIOD 
Because everything around us is being run by these .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we have critical infrastructure .PERIOD 
Everything is being run by computers .PERIOD 
Everything is reliant on these computers working .PERIOD 
We have become very reliant on Internet ,COMMA on basic things like electricity ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA on computers working .PERIOD 
And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us .PERIOD 
We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .PERIOD 
So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren't there .PERIOD 
It's actually very basic stuff -DASH -DASH thinking about continuity ,COMMA thinking about backups ,COMMA thinking about the things that actually matter .PERIOD 
Now I told you -DASH -DASH I love the Internet .PERIOD I do .PERIOD 
Think about all the services we have online .PERIOD 
Think about if they are taken away from you ,COMMA if one day you don't actually have them for some reason or another .PERIOD 
I see beauty in the future of the Internet ,COMMA but I'm worried that we might not see that .PERIOD 
Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us .PERIOD 
I've spent my life defending the Net ,COMMA and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime ,COMMA we are running a risk of losing it all .PERIOD 
We have to do this globally ,COMMA and we have to do it right now .PERIOD 
What we need is more global ,COMMA international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs -DASH -DASH these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks .PERIOD 
That's much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls .PERIOD 
What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks ,COMMA and even more importantly ,COMMA we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime ,COMMA but haven't yet done it .PERIOD 
We have to find the people with the skills ,COMMA but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you quickly how to predict ,COMMA and illustrate it with some predictions about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years .PERIOD 
In order to predict effectively ,COMMA we need to use science .PERIOD 
And the reason that we need to use science is because then we can reproduce what we're doing ;SEMICOLON it's not just wisdom or guesswork .PERIOD 
And if we can predict ,COMMA then we can engineer the future .PERIOD 
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy ,COMMA or you are concerned to influence national security policy ,COMMA or health policy ,COMMA or education ,COMMA science -DASH -DASH and a particular branch of science -DASH -DASH is a way to do it ,COMMA not the way we've been doing it ,COMMA which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom .PERIOD 
Now before I get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising ,COMMA because I'm not engaged in the business of magic .PERIOD 
There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict ,COMMA and there are some that it can't .PERIOD 
It can predict complex negotiations or situations involving coercion -DASH -DASH that is in essence everything that has to do with politics ,COMMA much of what has to do with business ,COMMA but sorry ,COMMA if you're looking to speculate in the stock market ,COMMA I don't predict stock markets -DASH -DASH OK ,COMMA it's not going up any time really soon .PERIOD 
But I'm not engaged in doing that .PERIOD 
I actually get phone calls from people who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win .PERIOD 
I engage in the use of game theory ,COMMA game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA that even in the study of politics ,COMMA math has come into the picture .PERIOD 
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics ,COMMA we need to look at this in a rigorous way .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what is game theory about ?QUESTIONMARK 
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them .PERIOD 
That doesn't seem terribly shocking -DASH -DASH although it's controversial for a lot of people -DASH -DASH that we are self-interested .PERIOD 
In order to look out for what's best for them or what they think is best for them ,COMMA people have values -DASH -DASH they identify what they want ,COMMA and what they don't want .PERIOD 
And they have beliefs about what other people want ,COMMA and what other people don't want ,COMMA how much power other people have ,COMMA how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want .PERIOD 
And they face limitations ,COMMA constraints ,COMMA they may be weak ,COMMA they may be located in the wrong part of the world ,COMMA they may be Einstein ,COMMA stuck away farming someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed ,COMMA as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time ,COMMA a great mathematician but nobody noticed .PERIOD 
Now who is rational ?QUESTIONMARK 
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA what if people are rational ?QUESTIONMARK 
Terrorists ,COMMA they're rational .PERIOD 
Pretty much everybody is rational .PERIOD 
I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of -DASH -DASH two-year-olds ,COMMA they are not rational ,COMMA they have very fickle preferences ,COMMA they switch what they think all the time ,COMMA and schizophrenics are probably not rational ,COMMA but pretty much everybody else is rational .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA they are just trying to do what they think is in their own best interest .PERIOD 
Now in order to work out what people are going to do to pursue their interests ,COMMA we have to think about who has influence in the world .PERIOD 
If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior ,COMMA with regard to producing pollutants ,COMMA one approach ,COMMA the common approach ,COMMA is to exhort them to be better ,COMMA to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet .PERIOD 
And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have as big an effect ,COMMA as perhaps you would like it to have .PERIOD 
But if you show them that it's in their interest ,COMMA then they're responsive .PERIOD 
If we're looking at Iran ,COMMA the president of the United States we would like to think ,COMMA may have some influence -DASH -DASH certainly the president in Iran has some influence -DASH -DASH but we make a mistake if we just pay attention to the person at the top of the power ladder because that person doesn't know much about Iran ,COMMA or about energy policy ,COMMA or about health care ,COMMA or about any particular policy .PERIOD 
That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .PERIOD 
If we're talking about national security problems ,COMMA maybe it's the Secretary of State ,COMMA maybe it's the Secretary of Defense ,COMMA the Director of National Intelligence ,COMMA maybe the ambassador to the United Nations ,COMMA or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem .PERIOD 
But let's face it ,COMMA the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran .PERIOD 
The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran .PERIOD 
Each of those people in turn has advisers who advise them ,COMMA so they can advise the president .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA a lot of times we don't do that .PERIOD 
There's a good reason that we don't do that ,COMMA and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers ,COMMA we can overcome the limitation of just looking at a few people .PERIOD 
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers .PERIOD 
Imagine for example that Sally over here ,COMMA wants to know what Harry ,COMMA and Jane ,COMMA and George and Frank are thinking ,COMMA and sends messages to those people .PERIOD 
Sally's giving her opinion to them ,COMMA and they're giving their opinion to Sally .PERIOD 
But Sally also wants to know what Harry is saying to these three ,COMMA and what they're saying to Harry .PERIOD 
And Harry wants to know what each of those people are saying to each other ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying .PERIOD 
That's a complicated problem ;SEMICOLON that's a lot to know .PERIOD 
With five decision-makers there are a lot of linkages -DASH -DASH <NUM> ,COMMA as a matter of fact ,COMMA if you remember your factorials .PERIOD 
Five factorial is <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now you may be surprised to know that smart people can keep <NUM> things straight in their head .PERIOD 
Suppose we double the number of influencers from five to <NUM> .PERIOD 
Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information we need to know ,COMMA from <NUM> to <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
No .PERIOD How about <NUM> times ?QUESTIONMARK 
To <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK No .PERIOD 
We've increased it to <NUM> million .PERIOD 
Nobody can keep that straight in their head .PERIOD 
But computers ,COMMA they can .PERIOD They don't need coffee breaks ,COMMA they don't need vacations ,COMMA they don't need to go to sleep at night ,COMMA they don't ask for raises either .PERIOD 
They can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .PERIOD 
So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it ,COMMA and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran ,COMMA and you're going to be wondering ,COMMA Why should we listen to this guy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why should we believe what he's saying ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I'm going to show you a factoid .PERIOD 
This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency of the percentage of time that the model I'm talking about is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known ,COMMA when the experts who provided the data inputs got it wrong .PERIOD 
That's not my claim ,COMMA that's a CIA claim -DASH -DASH you can read it ,COMMA it was declassified a while ago .PERIOD You can read it in a volume edited by H .PERIOD Bradford Westerfield ,COMMA Yale University Press .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do we need to know in order to predict ?QUESTIONMARK 
You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much .PERIOD 
We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision .PERIOD 
We need to know what they say they want ,COMMA not what they want in their heart of hearts ,COMMA not what they think they can get ,COMMA but what they say they want ,COMMA because that is a strategically chosen position ,COMMA and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making .PERIOD 
We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up ,COMMA and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate -DASH -DASH how big a deal is it to them ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how much clout could they bring to bear if they chose to engage on the issue ?QUESTIONMARK 
If we know those things we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody cares about two things on any decision .PERIOD 
They care about the outcome .PERIOD They'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible .PERIOD 
They're careerists ,COMMA they also care about getting credit -DASH -DASH there's ego involvement ,COMMA they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome ,COMMA or as important ,COMMA if it's their druthers ,COMMA to block an outcome .PERIOD 
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things .PERIOD 
Different people trade off between standing by their outcome ,COMMA faithfully holding to it ,COMMA going down in a blaze of glory ,COMMA or giving it up ,COMMA putting their finger in the wind ,COMMA and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position .PERIOD 
Most people fall in between ,COMMA and if we can work out where they fall we can work out how to negotiate with them to change their behavior .PERIOD 
You might notice what we don't need to know :COLON there's no history in here .PERIOD 
How they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information ,COMMA but once we know where they are we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future .PERIOD 
How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting .PERIOD 
So where are we going to get this information ?QUESTIONMARK 
We can get this information from the Internet ,COMMA from The Economist ,COMMA The Financial Times ,COMMA The New York Times ,COMMA U.S .PERIOD News and World Report ,COMMA lots of sources like that ,COMMA or we can get it from asking experts who spend their lives studying places and problems ,COMMA because those experts know this information .PERIOD 
If they don't know ,COMMA who are the people trying to influence the decision ,COMMA how much clout do they have ,COMMA how much they care about this issue ,COMMA and what do they say they want ,COMMA are they experts ?QUESTIONMARK That's what it means to be an expert ,COMMA that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know .PERIOD 
Alright ,COMMA lets turn to Iran .PERIOD 
Let me make three important predictions -DASH -DASH you can check this out ,COMMA time will tell .PERIOD 
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program ?QUESTIONMARK 
How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran ?QUESTIONMARK 
And everybody's best friend ,COMMA Ahmadinejad .PERIOD How are things going for him ?QUESTIONMARK 
How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two ?QUESTIONMARK 
You take a look at this ,COMMA this is not based on statistics .PERIOD 
I want to be very clear here .PERIOD I'm not projecting some past data into the future .PERIOD 
I've taken inputs on positions and so forth ,COMMA run it through a computer model that had simulated the dynamics of interaction ,COMMA and these are the simulated dynamics ,COMMA the predictions about the path of policy .PERIOD 
So you can see here on the vertical axis ,COMMA I haven't shown it all the way down to zero ,COMMA there are lots of other options ,COMMA but here I'm just showing you the prediction ,COMMA so I've narrowed the scale .PERIOD 
Up at the top of the axis ,COMMA Build the Bomb .PERIOD 
At <NUM> ,COMMA we start somewhere above <NUM> ,COMMA between building a bomb ,COMMA and making enough weapons-grade fuel so that you could build a bomb .PERIOD 
That's where ,COMMA according to my analyses ,COMMA the Iranians were at the beginning of this year .PERIOD 
And then the model makes predictions down the road .PERIOD 
At <NUM> they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel to show that they know how ,COMMA but they wouldn't build a weapon :COLON they would build a research quantity .PERIOD 
It would achieve some national pride ,COMMA but not go ahead and build a weapon .PERIOD 
And down at <NUM> they would build civilian nuclear energy ,COMMA which is what they say is their objective .PERIOD 
The yellow line shows us the most likely path .PERIOD 
The yellow line includes an analysis of <NUM> decision makers in Iran ,COMMA and a vast number of outside influencers trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior ,COMMA various players in the United States ,COMMA and Egypt ,COMMA and Saudi Arabia ,COMMA and Russia ,COMMA European Union ,COMMA Japan ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD 
The white line reproduces the analysis if the international environment just left Iran to make its own internal decisions ,COMMA under its own domestic political pressures .PERIOD 
That's not going to be happening ,COMMA but you can see that the line comes down faster if they're not put under international pressure ,COMMA if they're allowed to pursue their own devices .PERIOD 
But in any event ,COMMA by the end of this year ,COMMA beginning of next year ,COMMA we get to a stable equilibrium outcome .PERIOD 
And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like ,COMMA but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with ,COMMA and that a lot of others can live with .PERIOD 
And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride by making enough weapons-grade fuel ,COMMA through research ,COMMA so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel ,COMMA but not enough to actually build a bomb .PERIOD 
How is this happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today ,COMMA but by <NUM> that gets to be a big block ,COMMA and you put these two together ,COMMA that's the controlling influence in Iran .PERIOD 
Out here today ,COMMA there are a bunch of people -DASH -DASH Ahmadinejad for example -DASH -DASH who would like not only to build a bomb ,COMMA but test a bomb .PERIOD 
These guys are all shrinking ,COMMA the power is all drifting out here ,COMMA so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel .PERIOD 
Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran ?QUESTIONMARK 
Take a look at these guys ,COMMA they're growing in power ,COMMA and by the way ,COMMA this was done a while ago before the current economic crisis ,COMMA and that's probably going to get steeper .PERIOD 
These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran ,COMMA the bankers ,COMMA the oil people ,COMMA the bazaaries .PERIOD 
They are growing in political clout ,COMMA as the mullahs are isolating themselves -DASH -DASH with the exception of one group of mullahs ,COMMA who are not well known to Americans .PERIOD 
That's this line here ,COMMA growing in power ,COMMA these are what the Iranians call the quietists .PERIOD 
These are the Ayatollahs ,COMMA mostly based in Qom ,COMMA who have great clout in the religious community ,COMMA have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder ,COMMA because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction ,COMMA a direction contrary to what Khomeini had in mind .PERIOD 
Two things to notice :COLON he's getting weaker ,COMMA and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States ,COMMA he is not a major player in Iran .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA so I'd like you to take a little away from this .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA whether we're talking health policy ,COMMA education ,COMMA environment ,COMMA energy ,COMMA litigation ,COMMA mergers ,COMMA all of these are complicated problems that are predictable ,COMMA that this sort of technology can be applied to .PERIOD 
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important ,COMMA is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it ,COMMA but because if you can predict what people will do ,COMMA you can engineer what they will do .PERIOD 
I would like to leave you with one thought ,COMMA which is for me ,COMMA the dominant theme of this gathering ,COMMA and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world .PERIOD 
When people say to you ,COMMA That's impossible ,COMMA you say back to them ,COMMA When you say 'That's impossible ,COMMA ' you're confused with ,COMMA 'I don't know how to do it.' Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON One question for you .PERIOD 
That was fascinating .PERIOD 
I love that you put it out there .PERIOD 
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though ,COMMA just panicking whether you'd included in your model ,COMMA the possibility that putting this prediction out there might change the result .PERIOD 
We've got <NUM> people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks .PERIOD 
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita :COLON I've thought about that ,COMMA and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community ,COMMA they've also pondered that .PERIOD 
It would be a good thing if people paid more attention ,COMMA took seriously ,COMMA and engaged in the same sorts of calculations ,COMMA because it would change things .PERIOD But it would change things in two beneficial ways .PERIOD 
It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement ,COMMA and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with ,COMMA without having to manipulate them so much -DASH -DASH which is basically what I do ,COMMA I manipulate them .PERIOD 
So it would be a good thing .PERIOD 
So you're kind of trying to say ,COMMA People of Iran ,COMMA this is your destiny ,COMMA lets go there .PERIOD 
BBM :COLON Well ,COMMA people of Iran ,COMMA this is what many of you are going to evolve to want ,COMMA and we could get there a lot sooner ,COMMA and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions ,COMMA and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end ,COMMA and the world would be a better place .PERIOD 
Here's hoping they hear it that way .PERIOD Thank you very much Bruce .PERIOD 
BBM :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited .PERIOD 
My excitement is :COLON I get a chance to give something back .PERIOD 
My challenge is :COLON the shortest seminar I usually do is <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
I'm not exaggerating .PERIOD I do weekends ,COMMA and what I do -DASH -DASH I do even more than that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA coach people -DASH -DASH but I'm into immersion .PERIOD Because how did you learn language ?QUESTIONMARK 
You didn't learn it by just learning principles ,COMMA you got in it and you did it so often that it became real .PERIOD 
And the bottom line of why I'm here ,COMMA besides being a crazy mofo ,COMMA is that I'm really in a position -DASH -DASH I'm not here to motivate you ,COMMA obviously ;SEMICOLON you don't need that .PERIOD 
And a lot of times that's what people think I do ,COMMA and it's the furthest thing from it .PERIOD What happens ,COMMA though ,COMMA is people say to me ,COMMA I don't need any motivation .PERIOD 
And I say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's interesting .PERIOD That's not what I do .PERIOD 
I'm the Why guy .PERIOD I want to know why you do what you do .PERIOD 
What is your motive for action ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is it that drives you in your life today ?QUESTIONMARK Not <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Or are you running the same pattern ?QUESTIONMARK Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive ,COMMA activated ,COMMA is the most important thing in the world .PERIOD 
I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life .PERIOD 
All of us here have great minds .PERIOD 
You know ?QUESTIONMARK Most of us here have great minds ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't know about another category ,COMMA but we all know how to think .PERIOD 
And with our minds we can rationalize anything .PERIOD 
We can make anything happen .PERIOD We can -DASH -DASH I agree with what was described a few days ago ,COMMA about this idea that people work in their self-interest .PERIOD 
But we all know that that's bullshit at times .PERIOD 
You don't work in your self-interest all the time ,COMMA because when emotion comes into it ,COMMA the wiring changes in the way it functions .PERIOD 
And so it's wonderful for us to think intellectually about how the life of the world is ,COMMA and especially those who are very smart -DASH -DASH we can play this game in our head .PERIOD 
But I really want to know what's driving you .PERIOD 
And what I would like to maybe invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today ,COMMA for two reasons .PERIOD One :COLON so that you can contribute more .PERIOD And two :COLON so that hopefully we can not just understand other people more ,COMMA but maybe appreciate them more ,COMMA and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face in our society today .PERIOD 
They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that's connecting us ,COMMA because it's making us intersect .PERIOD And that intersection doesn't always create the view of everybody now understands everybody ,COMMA and everybody appreciates everybody .PERIOD 
What makes the difference in their performance ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because that's what I got hired to do .PERIOD 
I've got to produce the result now .PERIOD 
That's what I've done for <NUM> years .PERIOD I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television ,COMMA and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course .PERIOD 
And I've got to do something right now to get the result or nothing matters .PERIOD I get the phone call when the child is going commit suicide ,COMMA and I've got to do something right now .PERIOD And in <NUM> years -DASH -DASH I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
It doesn't mean I won't some day .PERIOD But I haven't done it ,COMMA and the reason is an understanding of these human needs that I want to talk to you about .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when I get those calls about performance ,COMMA that's one thing .PERIOD 
How do you make a change ?QUESTIONMARK 
But also ,COMMA I'm looking to see what is it that's shaping that person's ability to contribute ,COMMA to do something beyond themselves .PERIOD So maybe the real question is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I look at life and say ,COMMA there's two master lessons .PERIOD 
One is :COLON there's the science of achievement ,COMMA which almost everything that's run is mastered to an amazing extent .PERIOD 
That's How do you take the invisible and make it visible ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you take what you're dreaming of and make it happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
We know the rules .PERIOD You write the code .PERIOD You follow the -DASH -DASH and you get the results .PERIOD Once you know the game you just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you up the ante ,COMMA don't you ?QUESTIONMARK 
But when it comes to fulfillment -DASH -DASH that's an art .PERIOD 
And the reason is ,COMMA it's about appreciation and it's about contribution .PERIOD You can only feel so much by yourself .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question ,COMMA which is what's the difference in somebody's life if you look at somebody like those people that you've given everything to ?QUESTIONMARK Like all the resources they say they need .PERIOD You gave them not a 100-dollar computer ;SEMICOLON you gave them the best computer .PERIOD You gave them love ;SEMICOLON you gave them joy .PERIOD You were there to comfort them .PERIOD 
And those people very often -DASH -DASH and you know some of them ,COMMA I'm sure -DASH -DASH end up the rest of their life with all this love ,COMMA education ,COMMA money and background ,COMMA spending their life going in and out of rehab .PERIOD 
And then you meet people that have been through ultimate pain -DASH -DASH psychologically ,COMMA sexually ,COMMA spiritually ,COMMA emotionally abused -DASH -DASH and not always ,COMMA but often ,COMMA they become some of the people that contribute the most to society .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the question we've got to ask ourselves really is ,COMMA what is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is it that shapes us ?QUESTIONMARK And we live in a therapy culture .PERIOD 
Most of us don't do that ,COMMA but the culture's a therapy culture .PERIOD 
And what I mean by that is the mindset that we are our past .PERIOD 
The past equals the future .PERIOD And of course it does if you live there .PERIOD 
But what people in this room know ,COMMA and what we have to remind ourselves ,COMMA though -DASH -DASH because you can know something intellectually ,COMMA you can know what to do and then not use it ,COMMA not apply it .PERIOD 
So really ,COMMA we're going to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power .PERIOD That's what it really is .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when you ask people ,COMMA you know ,COMMA have you failed to achieve something ?QUESTIONMARK 
How many have ever failed to achieve something significant in your life ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
Thanks for the interaction on a high level there .PERIOD 
But if you ask people ,COMMA why didn't you achieve something ?QUESTIONMARK 
Somebody who's working for you ,COMMA you know ,COMMA or a partner ,COMMA or even yourself .PERIOD When you fail to achieve a goal ,COMMA what's the reason people say they fail to achieve ?QUESTIONMARK 
What do they tell you ?QUESTIONMARK Don't have the -DASH -DASH didn't know enough ,COMMA didn't have the -DASH -DASH knowledge .PERIOD Didn't have the -DASH -DASH money .PERIOD 
Didn't have the -DASH -DASH time .PERIOD Didn't have the -DASH -DASH technology .PERIOD You know ,COMMA I didn't have the right manager .PERIOD Didn't have the .. .PERIOD 
And -DASH -DASH and -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH what do all those ,COMMA including the Supreme Court ,COMMA have in common ?QUESTIONMARK 
They are a claim to you missing resources ,COMMA and they may be accurate .PERIOD 
You may not have the money ;SEMICOLON you may not have the Supreme Court ;SEMICOLON but that is not the defining factor .PERIOD 
And you correct me if I'm wrong .PERIOD 
The defining factor is never resources ;SEMICOLON it's resourcefulness .PERIOD 
And what I mean specifically ,COMMA rather than just some phrase ,COMMA is if you have emotion ,COMMA human emotion ,COMMA something that I experienced from you a day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced ,COMMA and if you'd communicated with that emotion I believe you would have beat his ass and won .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA how easy for me to tell him what he should do .PERIOD 
Idiot ,COMMA Robbins .PERIOD But I know when we watched the debate at that time ,COMMA there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity .PERIOD 
And the way that it came across to some people on that day -DASH -DASH because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't ,COMMA and I was upset .PERIOD But there was emotion that was there .PERIOD 
How many know what I'm talking about here ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA emotion is it .PERIOD And if we get the right emotion ,COMMA we can get ourselves to do anything .PERIOD We can get through it .PERIOD 
If you're creative enough ,COMMA playful enough ,COMMA fun enough ,COMMA can you get through to anybody ?QUESTIONMARK Yes or no ?QUESTIONMARK 
Audience :COLON Yes .PERIOD 
But this is not the story that people tell us ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
The story people tell us is a bunch of different stories .PERIOD 
They tell us we don't have the resources ,COMMA but ultimately ,COMMA if you take a look here -DASH -DASH flip it up ,COMMA if you would -DASH -DASH they say ,COMMA what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Next one ,COMMA please .PERIOD He's broken my pattern ,COMMA that son-of-a-bitch .PERIOD 
But I appreciated the energy ,COMMA I'll tell you that .PERIOD 
What determines your resources ?QUESTIONMARK We've said decisions shape destiny ,COMMA which is my focus here .PERIOD If decisions shape destiny ,COMMA what determines it is three decisions .PERIOD What are you going to focus on ?QUESTIONMARK 
Right now ,COMMA you have to decide what you're going to focus on .PERIOD 
Is this the end or the beginning ?QUESTIONMARK Is God punishing me or rewarding me ,COMMA or is this the roll of the dice ?QUESTIONMARK 
An emotion ,COMMA then ,COMMA creates what we're going to do or the action .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA think about your own life ,COMMA the decisions that have shaped your destiny .PERIOD 
And that sounds really heavy ,COMMA but in the last five or <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA how have there been some decisions you've made that if you'd made a different decision ,COMMA your life would be completely different ?QUESTIONMARK How many can think about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD 
So the bottom line is ,COMMA maybe it was where to go to work ,COMMA and you met the love of your life there .PERIOD 
Maybe it was a career decision .PERIOD I know the Google geniuses I saw here -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA I understand that their decision was to sell their technology at first .PERIOD What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture ?QUESTIONMARK How would the world be different ?QUESTIONMARK 
The history of our world is these decisions .PERIOD 
When a woman stands up and says ,COMMA No ,COMMA I won't go to the back of the bus ,COMMA she didn't just affect her life .PERIOD That decision shaped our culture .PERIOD 
Or someone standing in front of a tank .PERIOD Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong ,COMMA and someone says to you ,COMMA You've got testicular cancer .PERIOD That's pretty tough for any male ,COMMA especially if you ride a bike .PERIOD 
You've got it in your brain ;SEMICOLON you've got it in your lungs .PERIOD 
But what was his decision of what to focus on ?QUESTIONMARK 
Different than most people .PERIOD What did it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
It wasn't the end ;SEMICOLON it was the beginning .PERIOD What am I going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer ,COMMA because he got emotional fitness ,COMMA psychological strength .PERIOD That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million that I've been around .PERIOD 
Because that's about my lab .PERIOD I've had three million people from <NUM> different countries that I've had a chance to interact with over the last <NUM> years .PERIOD And after a while ,COMMA patterns become obvious .PERIOD 
You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK Other people say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA that sounds ridiculous .PERIOD It's simple .PERIOD So ,COMMA what shaped Lance ?QUESTIONMARK 
What shapes you ?QUESTIONMARK Two invisible forces .PERIOD Very quickly .PERIOD One :COLON state .PERIOD 
We all have had time .PERIOD 
So if you had a time you did something ,COMMA and after you did it you thought to yourself ,COMMA I can't believe I said that ,COMMA I can't believe I did that ,COMMA that was so stupid -DASH -DASH who's been there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD 
Have you ever done something ,COMMA after you did it ,COMMA you go ,COMMA That was me !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Right ?QUESTIONMARK It wasn't your ability ;SEMICOLON it was your state .PERIOD 
Your model of the world is what shapes you long term .PERIOD 
Your model of the world is the filter .PERIOD That's what's shaping us .PERIOD 
That's what makes people make decisions .PERIOD 
When we want to influence somebody ,COMMA we've got to know what already influences them .PERIOD 
And it's made up of three parts ,COMMA I believe .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA what's your target ?QUESTIONMARK What are you after ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which ,COMMA I believe -DASH -DASH it's not your desires .PERIOD 
You can get your desires or goals .PERIOD How many have ever got a goal or desire and thought ,COMMA is this all there is ?QUESTIONMARK 
How many have been there ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's needs we have .PERIOD I believe there are six human needs .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth -DASH -DASH you don't form it ;SEMICOLON you uncover it -DASH -DASH then you find out what's your map ,COMMA what's the belief systems that are telling you how to get those needs .PERIOD 
Some people think the way to get those needs is destroy the world ,COMMA some people is to build something ,COMMA create something ,COMMA love someone .PERIOD 
And then there's the fuel you pick .PERIOD So very quickly ,COMMA six needs .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA these are not goals or desires ,COMMA these are universal .PERIOD 
Everyone needs certainty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable .PERIOD Now ,COMMA how do you get it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Control everybody ?QUESTIONMARK Develop a skill ?QUESTIONMARK Give up ?QUESTIONMARK Smoke a cigarette ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if you got totally certain ,COMMA ironically ,COMMA even though we all need that -DASH -DASH like if you're not certain about your health ,COMMA or your children ,COMMA or money ,COMMA you don't think about much .PERIOD 
You're not sure if the ceiling's going to hold up ,COMMA you're not going to listen to any speaker .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA while we go for certainty differently ,COMMA if we get total certainty ,COMMA we get what ?QUESTIONMARK What do you feel if you're certain ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know what's going to happen ,COMMA when it's going to happen ,COMMA how it's going to happen -DASH -DASH what would you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
Bored out of your minds .PERIOD So ,COMMA God ,COMMA in Her infinite wisdom ,COMMA gave us a second human need ,COMMA which is uncertainty .PERIOD 
We need variety .PERIOD We need surprise .PERIOD 
How many of you here love surprises ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON Aye .PERIOD 
Bullshit .PERIOD You like the surprises you want .PERIOD 
The ones you don't want you call problems ,COMMA but you need them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA variety is important .PERIOD Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen ?QUESTIONMARK Who's done this ?QUESTIONMARK Get a fucking life .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD Why are you doing it ?QUESTIONMARK You're certain it's good because you read it before ,COMMA saw it before ,COMMA but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten ,COMMA that there's variety .PERIOD 
Third human need ,COMMA critical :COLON significance .PERIOD We all need to feel important ,COMMA special ,COMMA unique .PERIOD You can get it by making more money .PERIOD 
You can do it by being more spiritual .PERIOD 
You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know .PERIOD 
Whatever it takes .PERIOD The fastest way to do this ,COMMA if you have no background ,COMMA no culture ,COMMA no belief and resources or resourcefulness ,COMMA is violence .PERIOD If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood ,COMMA instantly I'm significant .PERIOD 
Zero to <NUM> .PERIOD How high ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD How certain am I that you're going to respond to me ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD How much uncertainty ?QUESTIONMARK 
Who knows what's going to happen next ?QUESTIONMARK Kind of exciting .PERIOD 
Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there .PERIOD Total variety and uncertainty .PERIOD 
And it's significant ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK So you want to risk your life for it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you can get significance a million ways ,COMMA but to be significant ,COMMA you've got to be unique and different .PERIOD 
Here's what we really need :COLON connection and love -DASH -DASH fourth need .PERIOD 
We all want it .PERIOD Most people settle for connection because love's too scary .PERIOD Don't want to get hurt .PERIOD 
Who here has ever been hurt in an intimate relationship ?QUESTIONMARK Say ,COMMA Aye .PERIOD 
If you don't raise your hand ,COMMA you'll have had other shit too ,COMMA come on .PERIOD 
And you're going to get hurt again .PERIOD 
Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit ?QUESTIONMARK 
But here's what's true -DASH -DASH we need it .PERIOD We can do it through intimacy ,COMMA through friendship ,COMMA through prayer ,COMMA through walking in nature .PERIOD 
If nothing else works for you ,COMMA get a dog .PERIOD Don't get a cat .PERIOD Get a dog ,COMMA because if you leave for two minutes ,COMMA it's like you've been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA these first four needs ,COMMA every human finds a way to meet .PERIOD 
Even if you lie to yourself ,COMMA you need to have split personalities .PERIOD 
But the last two needs -DASH -DASH the first four needs are called the needs of the personalities ,COMMA is what I call it -DASH -DASH the last two are the needs of the spirit .PERIOD 
And this is where fulfillment comes .PERIOD You won't get fulfillment from the first four .PERIOD You'll figure a way -DASH -DASH smoke ,COMMA drink ,COMMA do whatever -DASH -DASH to meet the first four ,COMMA but the last two -DASH -DASH number five :COLON you must grow .PERIOD We all know the answer here .PERIOD 
If you don't grow ,COMMA you're what ?QUESTIONMARK If a relationship's not growing ,COMMA if a business is not growing ,COMMA if you're not growing ,COMMA it doesn't matter how much money you have ,COMMA how many friends you have ,COMMA how many people love you ,COMMA you feel like hell .PERIOD And the reason we grow ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA is so we have something to give of value .PERIOD 
Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .PERIOD 
Because we all know ,COMMA corny as it sounds ,COMMA the secret to living is giving .PERIOD We all know life's not about me ;SEMICOLON it's about we .PERIOD This culture knows that .PERIOD This room knows that .PERIOD 
And it's exciting .PERIOD When you see Nicholas up here talking about his $100 computer ,COMMA the most passionate exciting thing is :COLON here's a genius ,COMMA but he's got a calling now .PERIOD 
You can feel the difference in him and it's beautiful .PERIOD 
And that calling can touch other people .PERIOD In my own life ,COMMA my life was touched because when I was <NUM> years old ,COMMA Thanksgiving ,COMMA no money ,COMMA no food -DASH -DASH we're not going to starve ,COMMA but my father was totally messed up .PERIOD My mom was letting him know how bad he messed up .PERIOD And somebody came to the door and delivered food .PERIOD My father made three decisions .PERIOD 
I know what they were briefly .PERIOD His focus was :COLON This is charity .PERIOD 
What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK I'm worthless .PERIOD What've I got to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Leave my family .PERIOD Which he did .PERIOD The time was one of the most painful experiences of life .PERIOD My three decisions gave me a different path .PERIOD 
I don't even know who it is .PERIOD My father always said ,COMMA No one gives a shit .PERIOD And all of a sudden ,COMMA somebody I don't know ,COMMA they're not asking for anything ,COMMA they're just giving our family food ,COMMA looking out for us .PERIOD It made me believe this :COLON What does it mean that strangers care ?QUESTIONMARK And what that made me decide is ,COMMA if strangers care about me and my family ,COMMA I care about them .PERIOD 
What am I going to do ?QUESTIONMARK I'm going to do something to make a difference .PERIOD So ,COMMA when I was <NUM> ,COMMA I went out one day on Thanksgiving .PERIOD It was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families .PERIOD 
The most fun thing I ever did in my life ,COMMA the most moving .PERIOD 
Then next year I did four .PERIOD I didn't tell anybody what I was doing .PERIOD 
Next year eight .PERIOD I wasn't doing it for brownie points ,COMMA but after eight ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA shit ,COMMA I could use some help .PERIOD 
So sure enough ,COMMA I went out and what did I do ?QUESTIONMARK 
I got my friends involved and I grew companies and then I got <NUM> companies and I built the foundation .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA I'm proud to tell you ,COMMA last year we fed two million people in <NUM> countries through our foundation ,COMMA all during the holidays :COLON Thanksgiving ,COMMA Christmas -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH in all the different countries around the world .PERIOD 
It's been fantastic .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I don't tell you that to brag ;SEMICOLON I tell you because I'm proud of human beings ,COMMA because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it ,COMMA not talk about it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA finally -DASH -DASH and I'm about out of time -DASH -DASH the target that shapes you -DASH -DASH here's what's different about people .PERIOD We have the same needs ,COMMA but are you a certainty freak ?QUESTIONMARK Is that what you value most ,COMMA or uncertainty ?QUESTIONMARK This man here couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves .PERIOD Are you driven by significance or love ?QUESTIONMARK We all need all six ,COMMA but whatever your lead system is ,COMMA tilts you in a different direction .PERIOD 
And as you move in a direction ,COMMA you have a destination or destiny .PERIOD 
The second piece is the map .PERIOD Think of that as the operating system that tells you how to get there .PERIOD And some people's map is :COLON I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people ,COMMA and they're firemen .PERIOD Somebody else is :COLON I'm going to kill people to do it .PERIOD They're trying to meet the same needs of significance ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK They want to honor God or honor their family ,COMMA but they have a different map .PERIOD 
And there are seven different beliefs .PERIOD I can't go through them because I'm done .PERIOD The last piece is emotion .PERIOD 
I'd say one of the parts of the map is like time .PERIOD Some people's idea of a long time is <NUM> years .PERIOD Somebody else's is three seconds ,COMMA which is what I have .PERIOD 
And the last one I've already mentioned ,COMMA that fell to you .PERIOD 
If you've got a target and you've got a map and let's say -DASH -DASH I can't use Google because I love Macs and they haven't made it good for Macs yet -DASH -DASH so if you use MapQuest -DASH -DASH how many have made this fatal mistake of using MapQuest at some time ?QUESTIONMARK 
You use this thing and you don't get there .PERIOD Well ,COMMA imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go ?QUESTIONMARK 
The last thing is emotion .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here's what I'll tell you about emotion .PERIOD There are <NUM> emotions that we all have words for in the English language ,COMMA which is just a linguistic representation ,COMMA right ,COMMA that changes by language .PERIOD But if your dominant emotions -DASH -DASH if I had more time ,COMMA I have <NUM> people or <NUM> ,COMMA and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week ,COMMA and I gave them as long as they needed ,COMMA and on one side they write empowering emotions ,COMMA the other's disempowering -DASH -DASH guess how many emotions people experience ?QUESTIONMARK Less than <NUM> .PERIOD 
And half of those make them feel like shit .PERIOD So they got five or six good frickin' feelings ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK It's like they feel happy ,COMMA happy ,COMMA excited ,COMMA oh shit ,COMMA frustrated ,COMMA frustrated ,COMMA overwhelmed ,COMMA depressed .PERIOD 
How many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off ?QUESTIONMARK How many know somebody like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or ,COMMA no matter what happens ,COMMA they find a way to be happy or excited .PERIOD 
How may know somebody like this ?QUESTIONMARK Come on .PERIOD 
When <NUM>/<NUM> happened -DASH -DASH I'll finish with this -DASH -DASH I was in Hawaii .PERIOD 
I was with <NUM> people from <NUM> countries .PERIOD We were translating four languages simultaneously for a program that I was conducting for a week .PERIOD The night before was called Emotional Mastering .PERIOD I got up ,COMMA had no plan for the this ,COMMA and I said -DASH -DASH we had all these fireworks -DASH -DASH I do crazy shit ,COMMA fun stuff -DASH -DASH and then at the end I stopped -DASH -DASH I had this plan I was going to say but I never do what I'm going to say .PERIOD And all of a sudden I said ,COMMA When do people really start to live ?QUESTIONMARK When they face death .PERIOD 
And then I went through this whole thing about ,COMMA if you weren't going to get off this island ,COMMA if nine days from now you were going to die ,COMMA who would you call ,COMMA what would you say ,COMMA what would you do ?QUESTIONMARK One woman -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA that night is when <NUM>/<NUM> happened -DASH -DASH one woman had come to the seminar and when she came there ,COMMA her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered .PERIOD 
Her friend ,COMMA her new boyfriend ,COMMA wanted to marry her ,COMMA and she said no .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA If you leave and go to that Hawaii thing ,COMMA it's over with us .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA It's over .PERIOD When I finished that night ,COMMA she called him and left a message -DASH -DASH true story -DASH -DASH at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked ,COMMA saying ,COMMA Honey ,COMMA I love you ,COMMA I just want you to know I want to marry you .PERIOD It was stupid of me .PERIOD She was asleep ,COMMA because it was <NUM> a.m .PERIOD for us ,COMMA when he called her back from the top and said ,COMMA Honey ,COMMA I can't tell you what this means .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA I don't know how to tell you this ,COMMA but you gave me the greatest gift because I'm going to die .PERIOD 
And she played the recording for us in the room .PERIOD 
She was on Larry King later ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice .PERIOD And he said ,COMMA All I can say to you is ,COMMA this must be God's message to you ,COMMA honey .PERIOD From now on ,COMMA every day give your all ,COMMA love your all .PERIOD 
Don't let anything ever stop you .PERIOD She finishes ,COMMA and a man stands up and he says ,COMMA I'm from Pakistan ;SEMICOLON I'm a Muslim .PERIOD 
I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry ,COMMA but ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA this is retribution .PERIOD I can't tell you the rest because I'm out of time .PERIOD 
<NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
All I can tell you is ,COMMA I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center ,COMMA because I had about <NUM> New Yorkers there .PERIOD More than <NUM> lost their entire companies ,COMMA their friends ,COMMA marking off their Palm Pilots -DASH -DASH one financial trader ,COMMA this woman made of steel ,COMMA bawling -DASH -DASH <NUM> friends crossing off that all died .PERIOD 
And what I did to people is said ,COMMA What are we going to focus on ?QUESTIONMARK 
What does this mean and what are we going to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I took the group and got people to focus on :COLON if you didn't lose somebody today ,COMMA your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else .PERIOD There are people -DASH -DASH then one woman got up and she was so angry and screaming and yelling .PERIOD 
Then I found out she wasn't from New York ;SEMICOLON she's not an American ;SEMICOLON she doesn't know anybody here .PERIOD I said ,COMMA Do you always get angry ?QUESTIONMARK 
She said ,COMMA Yes .PERIOD Guilty people got guilty ,COMMA sad people got sad .PERIOD 
And I took these two men and did what I call an indirect negotiation .PERIOD 
Jewish man with family in the occupied territory ,COMMA someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day ,COMMA and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and made it very clear .PERIOD 
And the integration that happened is on a film ,COMMA which I'll be happy to send you ,COMMA so you can really see what actually happened instead of my verbalization of it ,COMMA but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and morals of the world ,COMMA but they worked together to bring ,COMMA for almost four years now ,COMMA through various mosques and synagogues ,COMMA the idea of how to create peace .PERIOD And he wrote a book ,COMMA which is called My Jihad ,COMMA My Way of Peace .PERIOD So ,COMMA transformation can happen .PERIOD 
So my invitation to you is this :COLON explore your web ,COMMA the web in here -DASH -DASH the needs ,COMMA the beliefs ,COMMA the emotions that are controlling you ,COMMA for two reasons :COLON so there's more of you to give -DASH -DASH and achieve too ,COMMA we all want to do it -DASH -DASH but I mean give ,COMMA because that's what's going to fill you up .PERIOD And secondly ,COMMA so you can appreciate -DASH -DASH not just understand ,COMMA that's intellectual ,COMMA that's the mind -DASH -DASH but appreciate what's driving other people .PERIOD 
It's the only way our world's going to change .PERIOD God bless you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD I hope this was of service .PERIOD 
As a child ,COMMA I was raised by native Hawaiian elders -DASH -DASH three old women who took care of me while my parents worked .PERIOD 
The year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
We're at the ocean .PERIOD 
It's twilight .PERIOD 
We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides .PERIOD 
It's a stretch of beach we know so well .PERIOD 
The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us .PERIOD 
That would be a mistake .PERIOD 
These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators ,COMMA trained in the old ways by their elders ,COMMA and now they're passing it on to me .PERIOD 
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains ,COMMA of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars .PERIOD 
There's a new moon on the horizon .PERIOD 
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing .PERIOD 
They begin to chant .PERIOD 
[Hawaiian chant] When they finish ,COMMA they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them .PERIOD 
They want to teach me about my destiny .PERIOD 
I thought every seven-year-old went through this .PERIOD 
Baby girl ,COMMA someday the world will be in trouble .PERIOD 
People will forget their wisdom .PERIOD 
It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance .PERIOD 
You will go far away .PERIOD 
It will sometimes be a lonely road .PERIOD 
But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers ,COMMA and you will recognize your ohana ,COMMA your family .PERIOD 
And it will take all of you .PERIOD 
It will take all of you .PERIOD 
These words ,COMMA I hold onto all my life .PERIOD 
Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me .PERIOD 
The year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia .PERIOD 
Satawal is one half-mile long by one mile wide .PERIOD 
It's the home of my mentor .PERIOD 
His name is Pius Mau Piailug .PERIOD 
He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world .PERIOD 
There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island .PERIOD 
They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars ,COMMA the sequence and direction of waves ,COMMA the flight patterns of certain birds .PERIOD 
Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy .PERIOD 
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull ,COMMA it appeared that an old man was going to rest .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel .PERIOD 
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves .PERIOD 
Mau was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA gathering explicit data using his entire body .PERIOD 
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old .PERIOD 
Now science may dismiss this methodology ,COMMA but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .PERIOD 
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island ,COMMA and he would look out ,COMMA and then he would say ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA we go .PERIOD 
He saw that first glint of light -DASH -DASH he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now .PERIOD 
We are in such a critical moment of our collective history .PERIOD 
They have been compared to astronauts -DASH -DASH these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double-hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island .PERIOD 
Their canoes ,COMMA our rockets ;SEMICOLON their sea ,COMMA our space .PERIOD 
The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot .PERIOD 
This is part of our collective narrative .PERIOD 
It's humanity's DNA .PERIOD 
The year is <NUM> .PERIOD 
Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted ,COMMA the world is in trouble .PERIOD 
We live in a society bloated with data ,COMMA yet starved for wisdom .PERIOD 
We're connected <NUM>/<NUM> ,COMMA yet anxiety ,COMMA fear ,COMMA depression and loneliness is at an all-time high .PERIOD 
We must course-correct .PERIOD 
An African shaman said ,COMMA Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes .PERIOD 
This I know intimately ,COMMA because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them ,COMMA I struggle .PERIOD 
Mau passed away five months ago ,COMMA but his legacy and lessons live on .PERIOD 
Because when an elder dies a library is burned ,COMMA and throughout the world ,COMMA libraries are ablaze .PERIOD 
I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate .PERIOD 
And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way .PERIOD 
And this is what he said :COLON The island is the canoe ;SEMICOLON the canoe ,COMMA the island .PERIOD 
And what he meant was ,COMMA if you are voyaging and far from home ,COMMA your very survival depends on everyone aboard .PERIOD 
You cannot make the voyage alone ,COMMA you were never meant to .PERIOD 
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable .PERIOD 
It always was .PERIOD 
So in closing I would offer you this :COLON The planet is our canoe ,COMMA and we are the voyagers .PERIOD 
True navigation begins in the human heart .PERIOD 
It's the most important map of all .PERIOD 
Together ,COMMA may we journey well .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if you're in the audience today ,COMMA or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place ,COMMA you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .PERIOD 
Whether you're an artist ,COMMA a technologist ,COMMA a lawyer or a fan ,COMMA the handling of copyright directly impacts your life .PERIOD 
Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership ,COMMA it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .PERIOD 
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works .PERIOD 
Two years ago ,COMMA recording artist Chris Brown released the official video of his single Forever .PERIOD 
A fan saw it on TV ,COMMA recorded it with her camera phone ,COMMA and uploaded it to YouTube .PERIOD 
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it starts with content owners delivering assets into our database ,COMMA along with a usage policy that tells us what to do when we find a match .PERIOD 
We compare each upload against all of the reference files in our database .PERIOD 
This heat map is going to show you how the brain of the system works .PERIOD 
Here we can see the original reference file being compared to the user generated content .PERIOD 
The system compares every moment of one to the other to see if there's a match .PERIOD 
This means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file ,COMMA plays it in slow motion and has degraded audio and video quality .PERIOD 
And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube .PERIOD 
And that's over <NUM> hours of video every minute .PERIOD 
When we find a match ,COMMA we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down .PERIOD 
And the scale and the speed of this system is truly breathtaking .PERIOD 
We're not just talking about a few videos ,COMMA we're talking about over <NUM> years of video every day ,COMMA between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site .PERIOD 
When we compare those hundred years of video ,COMMA we're comparing it against millions of reference files in our database .PERIOD 
It would be like <NUM> people staring at <NUM> monitors each and every day ,COMMA without so much as a coffee break .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what do we do when we find a match ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA most rights owners ,COMMA instead of blocking ,COMMA will allow the copy to be published .PERIOD 
And then they benefit through the exposure ,COMMA advertising and linked sales .PERIOD 
Remember Chris Brown's video Forever ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts ,COMMA and that looked like the end of the story ,COMMA but sometime last year ,COMMA a young couple got married .PERIOD 
This is their wedding video .PERIOD 
You may have seen it .PERIOD 
What's amazing about this is ,COMMA if the processional of the wedding was this much fun ,COMMA can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA who are these people ?QUESTIONMARK 
I totally want to go to that wedding .PERIOD 
So their little wedding video went on to get over <NUM> million views .PERIOD 
And instead of Sony blocking ,COMMA they allowed the upload to occur .PERIOD 
And they put advertising against it and linked from it to iTunes .PERIOD 
And the song ,COMMA <NUM> months old ,COMMA went back to number four on the iTunes charts .PERIOD 
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these .PERIOD 
And Jill and Kevin ,COMMA the happy couple ,COMMA they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral .PERIOD 
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows ,COMMA and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference .PERIOD 
The JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of The Office ,COMMA which just goes to show ,COMMA it's truly an ecosystem of culture .PERIOD 
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios ,COMMA but sometimes big studios borrowing back .PERIOD 
By empowering choice ,COMMA we can create a culture of opportunity .PERIOD 
And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification .PERIOD 
It's because it's a big problem ,COMMA and it's complicated and messy .PERIOD 
It's not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners .PERIOD 
There's musical labels .PERIOD 
There's multiple music publishers .PERIOD 
And each of these can vary by country .PERIOD 
There's lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together .PERIOD 
So we have to manage many claims to the same video .PERIOD 
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases .PERIOD 
But the system only works through the participation of rights owners .PERIOD 
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube ,COMMA you should register in the Content ID system ,COMMA and then you'll have the choice about how your content is used .PERIOD 
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content .PERIOD 
By simply blocking all reuse ,COMMA you'll miss out on new art forms ,COMMA new audiences ,COMMA new distribution channels and new revenue streams .PERIOD 
Just look at all the joy that was spread through progressive rights management and new technology .PERIOD 
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade ,COMMA and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own .PERIOD 
And that was largely because there weren't any .PERIOD 
So I've been busy with a couple of projects ,COMMA and one of them was this :COLON The Nutmeg .PERIOD 
A 1930s ship's lifeboat ,COMMA which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA so now ,COMMA when the polar ice caps melt ,COMMA my recording studio will rise up like an ark ,COMMA and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G .PERIOD Ballard novel .PERIOD 
During the day ,COMMA the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse ,COMMA and from a <NUM> watt turbine up the mast .PERIOD 
So that when it gets dark ,COMMA I've got plenty of power .PERIOD 
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon .PERIOD 
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning ,COMMA and I work on new songs .PERIOD 
I'd like to play to you guys ,COMMA if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it .PERIOD 
It's about Billie Holiday .PERIOD 
And it appears that ,COMMA some night in <NUM> she left her physical space and was missing all night ,COMMA until she reappeared in the morning .PERIOD 
But I know where she was .PERIOD 
She was with me on my lifeboat .PERIOD 
And she was hot .PERIOD 
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way ,COMMA in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA I'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories ,COMMA people all around the world .PERIOD 
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common .PERIOD 
I think people are very similar ,COMMA but I also think that we have trouble seeing that .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps ,COMMA and I think we all see a lot of gaps .PERIOD 
And we define ourselves by our gaps .PERIOD 
There's language gaps ,COMMA there's ethnicity and racial gaps ,COMMA there's age gaps ,COMMA there's gender gaps ,COMMA there's sexuality gaps ,COMMA there's wealth and money gaps ,COMMA there's education gaps ,COMMA there's also religious gaps .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something ,COMMA some smaller community .PERIOD 
But I think that actually ,COMMA despite our gaps ,COMMA we really have a lot in common .PERIOD 
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves .PERIOD 
I think this is a very old human desire .PERIOD It's nothing new .PERIOD 
But the thing about self-expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA also ,COMMA is nothing new .PERIOD 
What's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities ,COMMA these acts of self-expression ,COMMA have been moving onto the Internet .PERIOD 
And as that's happened ,COMMA people have been leaving behind footprints ,COMMA footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression .PERIOD 
And so what I do is ,COMMA I write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints ,COMMA and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -DASH -DASH what they feel ,COMMA what they think ,COMMA what's different in the world today than usual ,COMMA these sorts of questions .PERIOD 
One project that explores these ideas ,COMMA which was made about a year ago ,COMMA is a piece called We Feel Fine .PERIOD 
This is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases I feel or I am feeling .PERIOD 
And when it finds one of those phrases ,COMMA it grabs the sentence up to the period ,COMMA and then automatically tries to deduce the age ,COMMA gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA knowing the geographical location and the time ,COMMA we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence .PERIOD 
All of this information is saved in a database that collects about <NUM> feelings a day .PERIOD 
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now .PERIOD 
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles ,COMMA each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours .PERIOD 
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -DASH -DASH so that happy ,COMMA positive feelings are brightly colored .PERIOD 
And sad ,COMMA negative feelings are darkly colored .PERIOD 
The diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside ,COMMA so that the large dots contain large sentences ,COMMA and the small dots contain small sentences .PERIOD 
Any dot can be clicked and expanded .PERIOD And we see here ,COMMA I would just feel so much better if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips .PERIOD 
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions .PERIOD 
And all of these are stated by people :COLON I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much ,COMMA but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond ,COMMA it's nice to feel bigger again .PERIOD 
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now .PERIOD 
You can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words .PERIOD Those six words represent the six movements of We Feel Fine .PERIOD We're currently seeing Madness .PERIOD 
And I'll walk you through a few of those now .PERIOD 
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .PERIOD 
I feel a bit better now .PERIOD 
I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do .PERIOD 
I feel gypped out of something awesome here .PERIOD 
I feel so free ;SEMICOLON I feel so good .PERIOD 
I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of .PERIOD 
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected .PERIOD And in that way ,COMMA you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy .PERIOD 
The next movement is called Montage .PERIOD 
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid .PERIOD 
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings in the last few hours ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up .PERIOD 
We see ,COMMA I just feel like I'm not going to have fun if it's not the both of us .PERIOD That was from someone in Michigan .PERIOD 
We see ,COMMA I feel like I have been at a computer all day .PERIOD 
These are automatically constructed using the found objects :COLON I think I feel a little full .PERIOD 
The next movement is called mobs .PERIOD 
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours .PERIOD 
We see that better is the most frequent feeling right now ,COMMA followed by good ,COMMA bad ,COMMA guilty ,COMMA right ,COMMA down ,COMMA sick and so on .PERIOD 
We can also get a gender breakdown .PERIOD 
And we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men .PERIOD 
We can do an age breakdown ,COMMA which gives us a histogram of the world's emotional distribution by age .PERIOD 
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific ,COMMA followed by teenagers ,COMMA and then people in their thirties ,COMMA and it dies out very quickly from there .PERIOD 
In weather ,COMMA the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent ,COMMA so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they're part of the sun .PERIOD 
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze .PERIOD 
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm ,COMMA and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings .PERIOD 
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data .PERIOD 
We see that the world is feeling used at <NUM> times the normal level right now .PERIOD 
They're feeling warm at <NUM> times the normal level ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
Other views are also available .PERIOD 
Here are gender ,COMMA age ,COMMA weather ,COMMA location .PERIOD 
The final movement is called Mounds .PERIOD 
It's a bit different from the others .PERIOD 
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large ,COMMA gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle .PERIOD 
And if I hold down my cursor ,COMMA they do a little dance .PERIOD 
We see better is the most frequent feeling ,COMMA followed by bad .PERIOD 
And then if I go over here ,COMMA the list begins to scroll ,COMMA and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected .PERIOD 
You can see the little pink cursor moving along ,COMMA representing our position .PERIOD 
Here we see people that feel slipping ,COMMA nauseous ,COMMA responsible .PERIOD 
There's also a search capability ,COMMA if you're interested in finding out about a certain population .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA you could find women who feel addicted in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh .PERIOD 
But I'll spare you that .PERIOD 
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected :COLON I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me .PERIOD 
I feel very lonely .PERIOD 
I need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that I can feel beautiful .PERIOD 
I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to .PERIOD 
I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life .PERIOD 
I love how I feel today .PERIOD 
So as you can see ,COMMA We Feel Fine uses a technique that I call passive observation .PERIOD 
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives .PERIOD It scans the world's blogs and looks at what people are writing ,COMMA and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed .PERIOD 
And because of that ,COMMA you end up getting very honest ,COMMA candid ,COMMA sincere responses that are often very moving .PERIOD 
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work because people don't know they're being interviewed .PERIOD 
They're just living life ,COMMA and they end up just acting like that .PERIOD 
Another technique is directly questioning people .PERIOD 
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project ,COMMA the Yahoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK Time Capsule ,COMMA which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in <NUM> .PERIOD 
It was divided into ten very simple themes -DASH -DASH love ,COMMA anger ,COMMA sadness and so on -DASH -DASH each of which contained a single ,COMMA very open-ended question put to the world :COLON What do you love ?QUESTIONMARK What makes you angry ?QUESTIONMARK 
What makes you sad ?QUESTIONMARK What do you believe in ?QUESTIONMARK And so on .PERIOD 
The time capsule was available for one month online ,COMMA translated into <NUM> languages ,COMMA and this is what it looked like .PERIOD 
It's a spinning globe ,COMMA the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule .PERIOD 
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule .PERIOD 
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .PERIOD 
There are two modes to the time capsule .PERIOD 
There's One World ,COMMA which presents the spinning globe ,COMMA and Many Voices ,COMMA which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one .PERIOD 
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event ,COMMA which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico at the Jemez Pueblo ,COMMA where for three consecutive nights ,COMMA the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls ,COMMA which stand about <NUM> feet tall .PERIOD It was really incredible .PERIOD 
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space .PERIOD 
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a <NUM> degree angle there .PERIOD This was amazing because the first night I looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier -DASH -DASH the differences in age ,COMMA gender and wealth and so on .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as I looked at this more and more and more ,COMMA and saw these images go across the rocks ,COMMA I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again .PERIOD 
You know :COLON weddings ,COMMA births ,COMMA funerals ,COMMA the first car ,COMMA the first kiss ,COMMA the first camel or horse -DASH -DASH depending on the culture .PERIOD 
And it was really moving .PERIOD And this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away ,COMMA where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space .PERIOD 
And there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .PERIOD 
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky ,COMMA and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA as a child in Vermont ,COMMA on a farm where I grew up ,COMMA I would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of Orion ,COMMA the Hunter .PERIOD 
And as an adult ,COMMA I've been more aware of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA Orion facing the roaring bull .PERIOD 
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda .PERIOD 
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA these are the great tales of the Greeks .PERIOD 
And it caused me to wonder specifically ,COMMA if we could make new constellations today ,COMMA what would those look like ?QUESTIONMARK What would those be ?QUESTIONMARK 
If we could make new pictures in the sky ,COMMA what would we draw ?QUESTIONMARK 
What are the great stories of today ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nobody's seen this yet ,COMMA publicly .PERIOD 
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's my great pleasure now to show this to you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA Universe will open here .PERIOD 
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field ,COMMA and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background ,COMMA kind of morphing with color .PERIOD The color of the Aurora Borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom ,COMMA and we'll put it down here to red .PERIOD 
So you see this kind of -DASH -DASH these stars moving along .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA these aren't just little points of light ,COMMA little pixels .PERIOD 
Each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -DASH -DASH a quote that was stated by somebody ,COMMA an image ,COMMA a news story ,COMMA a person ,COMMA a company .PERIOD You know ,COMMA some kind of heroic personality .PERIOD 
And you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars ,COMMA that shapes begin to emerge .PERIOD 
We see here there's a little man walking along ,COMMA or maybe a woman .PERIOD 
And we see here a photograph with a head .PERIOD 
You can start to see words emerging here .PERIOD 
And those are the constellations of today .PERIOD 
And I can turn them all on ,COMMA and you can see them moving across the sky now .PERIOD 
The data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world .PERIOD 
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with in New York ,COMMA actually ,COMMA called Daylife .PERIOD 
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months .PERIOD 
So we can see where it's emerging here ,COMMA like President Ford ,COMMA Iraq ,COMMA Bush .PERIOD And we can actually isolate just the words -DASH -DASH I call them secrets -DASH -DASH and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list .PERIOD And we see Anna Nicole Smith playing a big role recently .PERIOD 
President Ford -DASH -DASH this is Gerald Ford's funeral .PERIOD 
We can actually click anything in Universe and have it become the center of the universe ,COMMA and everything else will enter its orbit .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we'll click Ford ,COMMA and now that becomes the center .PERIOD 
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit and swirl around it .PERIOD 
We can isolate just the photographs ,COMMA and we now see those .PERIOD 
We can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .PERIOD 
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around .PERIOD 
We can click on this and we see this iconic image of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin .PERIOD 
In Universe ,COMMA there's kind of no end .PERIOD It just goes infinitely ,COMMA and you can just kind of click on stuff .PERIOD 
This is a photographic representation ,COMMA called Snapshots .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if we want to ,COMMA let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like .PERIOD 
And let's see ,COMMA in the past week ,COMMA what he's been up to .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA we have a new universe ,COMMA which is just constrained to all things Bill Clinton .PERIOD 
We can have his constellations emerge here .PERIOD 
We can pull out his secrets ,COMMA and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates ,COMMA Hillary ,COMMA presidential ,COMMA Barack Obama .PERIOD 
We can see the stories that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now .PERIOD 
Any of those can be opened up .PERIOD 
You can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source .PERIOD This one's from Al Jazeera .PERIOD 
We can also see the superstars .PERIOD These would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of Bill Clinton .PERIOD So there's Bill Clinton ,COMMA Hillary ,COMMA Iraq ,COMMA George Bush ,COMMA Barack Obama ,COMMA Scooter Libby -DASH -DASH these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton .PERIOD 
We can also see a world map ,COMMA so this shows us the geographic reach of Bill Clinton in the last week or so .PERIOD 
We can see he's been focused in America because he's been campaigning ,COMMA probably ,COMMA but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East .PERIOD 
And then we can also see a timeline .PERIOD 
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday ,COMMA but he was back to work on Sunday morning ,COMMA and actually been tapering off since then this week .PERIOD 
And it's not limited to just people or dates ,COMMA but we can actually put in concepts also .PERIOD 
So if I put in climate change for all of <NUM> ,COMMA we'll see what that universe looks like .PERIOD 
Here we have our star field .PERIOD Here we have our shapes .PERIOD 
Here we have our secrets .PERIOD 
So we see again ,COMMA climate change is large :COLON Nairobi ,COMMA global conference ,COMMA environmental .PERIOD 
And there are also quotes that you can see ,COMMA if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA this is really an infinite thing .PERIOD 
The superstars of climate change in <NUM> :COLON United States ,COMMA Britain ,COMMA China .PERIOD You know ,COMMA these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept .PERIOD 
So this is a piece that demands exploration .PERIOD 
This will be online in several days ,COMMA probably next Tuesday .PERIOD 
You'll notice that in Daylife -DASH -DASH rather ,COMMA in Universe -DASH -DASH it supports both the notion of a global mythology ,COMMA which is represented by something as broad as ,COMMA say ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and also a personal mythology .PERIOD 
So it's been a pleasure .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge :COLON the challenge of dealing with data ,COMMA data that we have to deal with in medical situations .PERIOD 
It's really a huge challenge for us .PERIOD 
And this is our beast of burden -DASH -DASH this is a Computer Tomography machine ,COMMA a CT machine .PERIOD 
It's a fantastic device .PERIOD 
It uses X-rays ,COMMA X-ray beams ,COMMA that are rotating very fast around the human body .PERIOD 
It takes about <NUM> seconds to go through the whole machine and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine .PERIOD 
So this is a fantastic machine that we can use for improving health care ,COMMA but as I said ,COMMA it's also a challenge for us .PERIOD 
And the challenge is really found in this picture here .PERIOD 
It's the medical data explosion that we're having right now .PERIOD 
And let me step back in time .PERIOD 
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .PERIOD 
These machines that came out -DASH -DASH they started coming in the 1970s -DASH -DASH they would scan human bodies ,COMMA and they would generate about <NUM> images of the human body .PERIOD 
And I've taken the liberty ,COMMA just for clarity ,COMMA to translate that to data slices .PERIOD 
That would correspond to about <NUM> megabytes of data ,COMMA which is small when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices .PERIOD 
If you translate that to phone books ,COMMA it's about one meter of phone books in the pile .PERIOD 
Looking at what we're doing today with these machines that we have ,COMMA we can ,COMMA just in a few seconds ,COMMA get <NUM> images out of a body ,COMMA and that would correspond to about <NUM> gigabytes of data ,COMMA or <NUM> phone books ,COMMA and the pile would then be <NUM> meters of phone books .PERIOD 
What's about to happen -DASH -DASH and we're seeing this ;SEMICOLON it's beginning -DASH -DASH a technology trend that's happening right now is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well .PERIOD 
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well .PERIOD 
And just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds ,COMMA and that would correspond to one terabyte of data -DASH -DASH that's <NUM> books and <NUM> kilometers of phone books .PERIOD 
That's one patient ,COMMA one data set .PERIOD 
And this is what we have to deal with .PERIOD 
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have .PERIOD 
And already today -DASH -DASH this is <NUM> images .PERIOD 
Imagine the days when we had radiologists doing this .PERIOD 
They would put up <NUM> images ,COMMA they would go like this ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA okay ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
They can't do that anymore .PERIOD That's impossible .PERIOD 
So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this .PERIOD 
So what we do is that we put all these slices together .PERIOD 
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions ,COMMA and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data ,COMMA into a block of data .PERIOD 
So this is really what we're doing .PERIOD 
So this gigabyte or terabyte of data ,COMMA we're putting it into this block .PERIOD 
But of course ,COMMA the block of data just contains the amount of X-ray that's been absorbed in each point in the human body .PERIOD 
So what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don't want to look at .PERIOD 
So transforming the data set into something that looks like this .PERIOD 
And this is a challenge .PERIOD 
This is a huge challenge for us to do that .PERIOD 
Using computers ,COMMA even though they're getting faster and better all the time ,COMMA it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data ,COMMA terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information .PERIOD 
I want to look at the heart .PERIOD 
I want to look at the blood vessels .PERIOD I want to look at the liver .PERIOD 
Maybe even find a tumor ,COMMA in some cases .PERIOD 
So this is where this little dear comes into play .PERIOD 
This is my daughter .PERIOD 
This is as of <NUM> a.m .PERIOD this morning .PERIOD 
She's playing a computer game .PERIOD 
She's only two years old ,COMMA and she's having a blast .PERIOD 
So she's really the driving force behind the development of graphics-processing units .PERIOD 
As long as kids are playing computer games ,COMMA graphics is getting better and better and better .PERIOD 
So please go back home ,COMMA tell your kids to play more games ,COMMA because that's what I need .PERIOD 
So what's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing with the medical data .PERIOD 
So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices .PERIOD 
I paid about one million dollars for that machine .PERIOD 
That machine is ,COMMA today ,COMMA about as fast as my iPhone .PERIOD 
So every month there are new graphics cards coming out ,COMMA and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors -DASH -DASH NVIDIA ,COMMA ATI ,COMMA Intel is out there as well .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA for a few hundred bucks you can get these things and put them into your computer ,COMMA and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards .PERIOD 
So this is really what's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine ,COMMA together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms -DASH -DASH compressing data ,COMMA extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on .PERIOD 
So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do .PERIOD 
You can see that this is a full data [set] .PERIOD 
It's a woman .PERIOD You can see the hair .PERIOD 
You can see the individual structures of the woman .PERIOD 
You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays on the teeth ,COMMA the metal in the teeth .PERIOD 
That's where those artifacts are coming from .PERIOD 
But fully interactively on standard graphics cards on a normal computer ,COMMA I can just put in a clip plane .PERIOD 
She had a bleeding up in the brain ,COMMA and that's been fixed with a little stent ,COMMA a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel .PERIOD 
And just by changing the functions ,COMMA then I can decide what's going to be transparent and what's going to be visible .PERIOD 
I can look at the skull structure ,COMMA and I can see that ,COMMA okay ,COMMA this is where they opened up the skull on this woman ,COMMA and that's where they went in .PERIOD 
So these are fantastic images .PERIOD 
They're really high resolution ,COMMA and they're really showing us what we can do with standard graphics cards today .PERIOD 
Now we have really made use of this ,COMMA and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data into the system .PERIOD 
So again ,COMMA looking at very ,COMMA very large data sets ,COMMA and you saw those full-body scans that we can do .PERIOD 
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner ,COMMA and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set .PERIOD 
And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off .PERIOD 
First you saw the body bag that the body came in ,COMMA then I'm peeling off the skin -DASH -DASH you can see the muscles -DASH -DASH and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman .PERIOD 
Now at this point ,COMMA I would also like to emphasize that ,COMMA with the greatest respect for the people that I'm now going to show -DASH -DASH I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies -DASH -DASH so it's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that I'm showing these pictures to you .PERIOD 
In the forensic case -DASH -DASH and this is something that .. .PERIOD there's been approximately <NUM> cases so far just in the part of Sweden that I come from that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years .PERIOD 
So this will be the typical workflow situation .PERIOD 
The police will decide -DASH -DASH in the evening ,COMMA when there's a case coming in -DASH -DASH they will decide ,COMMA okay ,COMMA is this a case where we need to do an autopsy ?QUESTIONMARK 
So in the morning ,COMMA in between six and seven in the morning ,COMMA the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners .PERIOD 
And then the radiologist ,COMMA together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist ,COMMA looks at the data that's coming out ,COMMA and they have a joint session .PERIOD 
And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that .PERIOD 
Now looking at a few cases ,COMMA here's one of the first cases that we had .PERIOD 
You can really see the details of the data set .PERIOD 
It's very high-resolution ,COMMA and it's our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA it's fully interactive ,COMMA so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .PERIOD 
Without saying too much about this case ,COMMA this is a traffic accident ,COMMA a drunk driver hit a woman .PERIOD 
And it's very ,COMMA very easy to see the damages on the bone structure .PERIOD 
And the cause of death is the broken neck .PERIOD 
And this women also ended up under the car ,COMMA so she's quite badly beaten up by this injury .PERIOD 
Here's another case ,COMMA a knifing .PERIOD 
And this is also again showing us what we can do .PERIOD 
It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body .PERIOD 
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth -DASH -DASH that's actually the filling of the teeth -DASH -DASH but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent .PERIOD 
Here's another violent case .PERIOD This really didn't kill the person .PERIOD 
Here's another case .PERIOD 
It's very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings .PERIOD 
Here you can see that knife went through the heart .PERIOD 
It's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part ,COMMA which is difficult to do in a normal ,COMMA standard ,COMMA physical autopsy .PERIOD 
So it really ,COMMA really helps the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death ,COMMA and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was .PERIOD 
Here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine on this person .PERIOD 
And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source ,COMMA so that bullet is actually shining ,COMMA and it makes it really easy to find these fragments .PERIOD 
One of the things that I'm really ,COMMA really happy to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table .PERIOD 
It's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms ,COMMA using standard graphics GPUs .PERIOD 
It actually looks like this ,COMMA just to give you a feeling for what it looks like .PERIOD 
It really just works like a huge iPhone .PERIOD 
So we've implemented all the gestures you can do on the table ,COMMA and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface .PERIOD 
So if you were thinking of buying an iPad ,COMMA forget about it .PERIOD This is what you want instead .PERIOD 
Steve ,COMMA I hope you're listening to this ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
So it's a very nice little device .PERIOD 
So it gained some traction ,COMMA and we're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes ,COMMA but also ,COMMA perhaps in the future ,COMMA in a more clinical situation .PERIOD 
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this ,COMMA if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA now that we're talking about touch ,COMMA let me move on to really touching data .PERIOD 
This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now ,COMMA but I hope they will in the future .PERIOD 
So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device .PERIOD 
It's a little mechanical pen that has very ,COMMA very fast step motors inside of the pen .PERIOD 
And so I can generate a force feedback .PERIOD 
So when I virtually touch data ,COMMA it will generate forces in the pen ,COMMA so I get a feedback .PERIOD 
So in this particular situation ,COMMA it's a scan of a living person .PERIOD 
I have this pen ,COMMA and I look at the data ,COMMA and I move the pen towards the head ,COMMA and all of a sudden I feel resistance .PERIOD 
So I can feel the skin .PERIOD 
If I push a little bit harder ,COMMA I'll go through the skin ,COMMA and I can feel the bone structure inside .PERIOD 
If I push even harder ,COMMA I'll go through the bone structure ,COMMA especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft .PERIOD 
And then I can feel the brain inside ,COMMA and this will be the slushy like this .PERIOD 
So this is really nice .PERIOD 
And to take that even further ,COMMA this is a heart .PERIOD 
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners ,COMMA that just in <NUM> seconds ,COMMA I can scan the whole heart ,COMMA and I can do that with time resolution .PERIOD 
So just looking at this heart ,COMMA I can play back a video here .PERIOD 
And this is Karljohan ,COMMA one of my graduate students who's been working on this project .PERIOD 
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device ,COMMA the force feedback system ,COMMA and he's moving his pen towards the heart ,COMMA and the heart is now beating in front of him ,COMMA so he can see how the heart is beating .PERIOD 
He's taken the pen ,COMMA and he's moving it towards the heart ,COMMA and he's putting it on the heart ,COMMA and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient .PERIOD 
Then he can examine how the heart is moving .PERIOD 
He can go inside ,COMMA push inside of the heart ,COMMA and really feel how the valves are moving .PERIOD 
And this ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is really the future for heart surgeons .PERIOD 
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon to be able to go inside of the patient's heart before you actually do surgery ,COMMA and do that with high-quality resolution data .PERIOD 
So this is really neat .PERIOD 
Now we're going even further into science fiction .PERIOD 
And we heard a little bit about functional MRI .PERIOD 
Now this is really an interesting project .PERIOD 
MRI is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain ,COMMA or any part of the body .PERIOD 
So what we're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain ,COMMA but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated and blood that's depleted of oxygen .PERIOD 
That means that it's possible to map out the activity of the brain .PERIOD 
So this is something that we've been working on .PERIOD 
And you just saw Motts the research engineer ,COMMA there ,COMMA going into the MRI system ,COMMA and he was wearing goggles .PERIOD 
So he could actually see things in the goggles .PERIOD 
So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner .PERIOD 
And this is a little bit freaky ,COMMA because what Motts is seeing is actually this .PERIOD 
He's seeing his own brain .PERIOD 
So Motts is doing something here ,COMMA and probably he is going like this with his right hand ,COMMA because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .PERIOD 
And then he can see that at the same time .PERIOD 
These visualizations are brand new .PERIOD 
And this is something that we've been researching for a little while .PERIOD 
This is another sequence of Motts' brain .PERIOD 
And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from <NUM> .PERIOD 
So he's going <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
And then he's going backwards .PERIOD 
And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain and is lighting up the whole brain .PERIOD 
Well this is fantastic .PERIOD We can do this in real time .PERIOD 
We can investigate things .PERIOD We can tell him to do things .PERIOD 
You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head ,COMMA because that's where he's seeing ,COMMA he's seeing his own brain .PERIOD 
The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well ,COMMA and it's shining through ,COMMA because all of the data is inside this volume .PERIOD 
So he's going like this .PERIOD 
For <NUM> seconds he's going like that ,COMMA and all of a sudden it lights up up here .PERIOD 
So we've got motor cortex activation up there .PERIOD 
So this is really ,COMMA really nice ,COMMA and I think this is a great tool .PERIOD 
And connecting also with the previous talk here ,COMMA this is something that we could use as a tool to really understand how the neurons are working ,COMMA how the brain is working ,COMMA and we can do this with very ,COMMA very high visual quality and very fast resolution .PERIOD 
Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center .PERIOD 
So this is a CAT scan -DASH -DASH Computer Aided Tomography .PERIOD 
So this is a lion from the local zoo outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden ,COMMA Elsa .PERIOD 
So she came to the center ,COMMA and they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA I get the whole data set from the lion .PERIOD 
And I can do very nice images like this .PERIOD 
I can peel off the layer of the lion .PERIOD 
And we've been experimenting with this .PERIOD 
And I think this is a great application for the future of this technology ,COMMA because there's very little known about the animal anatomy .PERIOD 
What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information .PERIOD 
We can scan all sorts of things ,COMMA all sorts of animals .PERIOD 
The only problem is to fit it into the machine .PERIOD 
So here's a bear .PERIOD 
It was kind of hard to get it in .PERIOD 
And the bear is a cuddly ,COMMA friendly animal .PERIOD 
And you might want to cuddle this one ,COMMA until you change the functions and look at this .PERIOD 
So be aware of the bear .PERIOD 
So with that ,COMMA I'd like to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images .PERIOD 
It's a huge effort that goes into doing this ,COMMA gathering the data and developing the algorithms ,COMMA writing all the software .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA some very talented people .PERIOD 
My motto is always ,COMMA I only hire people that are smarter than I am and most of these are smarter than I am .PERIOD 
So thank you very much .PERIOD 
It was an incredible surprise to me to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA basically ,COMMA I work as a theoretical physicist .PERIOD 
I develop and test models of the Big Bang ,COMMA using observational data .PERIOD 
And I've been moonlighting for the last five years helping with a project in Africa .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge .PERIOD 
People wonder ,COMMA you know ,COMMA How do you have time to do this ?QUESTIONMARK And so on .PERIOD 
And so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides .PERIOD 
So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why I lead this schizophrenic life .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime .PERIOD 
When they were released ,COMMA we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania .PERIOD 
Both were very young countries then ,COMMA and full of hope for the future .PERIOD 
We had an amazing childhood .PERIOD We didn't have any money ,COMMA but we were outdoors most of the time .PERIOD 
We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world ,COMMA like Kilimanjaro ,COMMA Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA then we moved to London for high school .PERIOD 
And after that -DASH -DASH there's nothing much to say about that .PERIOD 
It was rather dull .PERIOD But I came back to Africa at the age of <NUM> ,COMMA as a volunteer teacher to Lesotho ,COMMA which is a tiny country ,COMMA surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa .PERIOD 
Nevertheless ,COMMA I -DASH -DASH as I'm sure -DASH -DASH as a rather irritating young ,COMMA white man coming into their village ,COMMA I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth .PERIOD 
But the kids were the best part .PERIOD 
The kids were amazing :COLON extremely eager and often very bright .PERIOD 
And I'm just going to tell you one story ,COMMA which got through to me .PERIOD 
I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible ,COMMA to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .PERIOD 
And they weren't used to that .PERIOD 
But I took them outside one day and I said ,COMMA I want you to estimate the height of the building .PERIOD 
And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall ,COMMA size it up with a finger ,COMMA and make an estimate of the height .PERIOD 
But there was one little boy ,COMMA very small for his age .PERIOD 
And he wasn't doing that .PERIOD He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA I said -DASH -DASH I was annoyed -DASH -DASH I said ,COMMA What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want you to estimate the height of the building .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA OK .PERIOD I measured the height of a brick .PERIOD 
I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying .PERIOD 
Well -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH I hadn't thought of that one .PERIOD 
And many experiences like this happened to me .PERIOD 
Another one is that I met a miner .PERIOD He was home on his three-month leave from the mines .PERIOD 
Sitting next to him one day ,COMMA he said ,COMMA There's only one thing that I really loved at school .PERIOD 
And you know what it was ?QUESTIONMARK Shakespeare .PERIOD And he recited some to me .PERIOD 
And these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa -DASH -DASH inventive kids ,COMMA intellectual kids -DASH -DASH and starved of opportunity .PERIOD 
And if Africa is going to get fixed ,COMMA it's by them ,COMMA not by us .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA after -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH that's the truth .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA after Lesotho ,COMMA I traveled across Africa before returning to England -DASH -DASH so gray and depressing ,COMMA in comparison .PERIOD 
And I went to Cambridge .PERIOD And there ,COMMA I fell for theoretical physics .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I'm not going to explain this equation ,COMMA but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject .PERIOD 
We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA admittedly ,COMMA it's in a very shorthand notation .PERIOD 
And it contains <NUM> free parameters ,COMMA OK ,COMMA which we have to fit to the data .PERIOD 
So it's not the final story ,COMMA but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .PERIOD 
And apart from a few very important loose ends ,COMMA which you've heard about here -DASH -DASH like dark energy and dark matter -DASH -DASH this equation describes ,COMMA seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it .PERIOD 
But there's one big puzzle remaining ,COMMA and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in Tanzania ,COMMA who's a wonderful Scottish lady who I still stay in touch with .PERIOD 
And she's now in her 80s .PERIOD 
And when I try to explain my work to her ,COMMA she waved away all the details ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA Neil ,COMMA there's only one question that really matters .PERIOD 
What banged ?QUESTIONMARK 
Everyone talks about the Big Bang .PERIOD What banged ?QUESTIONMARK 
And she's right .PERIOD It's a question we've all been avoiding .PERIOD 
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence ,COMMA full of a strange kind of energy -DASH -DASH inflationary energy -DASH -DASH which blew it up .PERIOD 
But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely unsolved .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I worked on that theory for a while ,COMMA with Stephen Hawking and others .PERIOD 
But then I began to explore another alternative .PERIOD 
The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this possibility is actually suggested by the latest theories ,COMMA the unified theories ,COMMA which try to explain all those <NUM> free parameters in a single framework ,COMMA which will hopefully predict all of them .PERIOD 
And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here .PERIOD 
It's all I can convey .PERIOD According to these theories ,COMMA there are extra dimensions of space ,COMMA not just the three we're familiar with ,COMMA but at every point in the room there are more dimensions .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA there's one rather strange one ,COMMA in the most elegant unified theories we have .PERIOD 
The strange one looks likes this :COLON that we live in a three-dimensional world .PERIOD 
We live in one of these worlds ,COMMA and I can only show it as a sheet ,COMMA but it's really three-dimensional .PERIOD 
And a tiny distance away ,COMMA there's another sheet ,COMMA also three-dimensional ,COMMA and they're separated by a gap .PERIOD 
The gap is very tiny ,COMMA and I've blown it up so you can see it .PERIOD 
But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question .PERIOD 
Which is ,COMMA what happens if these two ,COMMA three-dimensional worlds should actually collide ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if they collide ,COMMA it would look a lot like the Big Bang .PERIOD 
But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture .PERIOD 
The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point .PERIOD 
Everything comes out of a point ;SEMICOLON you have infinite density .PERIOD And all the equations break down .PERIOD 
No hope of describing that .PERIOD 
In this picture ,COMMA you'll notice ,COMMA the bang is extended .PERIOD It's not a point .PERIOD 
The density of matter is finite ,COMMA and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA to cut a long story short ,COMMA we've explored this alternative .PERIOD 
We've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies ,COMMA the fluctuations in the microwave background .PERIOD 
Furthermore ,COMMA there's an experimental way to tell this theory ,COMMA apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before .PERIOD 
It involves gravitational waves .PERIOD 
And in this scenario ,COMMA not only was the Big Bang not the beginning ,COMMA as you can see from the picture ,COMMA it can happen over and over again .PERIOD 
It may be that we live in an endless universe ,COMMA both in space and in time .PERIOD 
And maybe we live in an endless universe .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA making and testing models of the universe is ,COMMA for me ,COMMA the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe .PERIOD 
We need to make the best mathematical models we can ,COMMA the most consistent ones .PERIOD 
And then we scrutinize them ,COMMA logically and with data .PERIOD 
And we try to convince ourselves -DASH -DASH we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong .PERIOD 
That's progress :COLON when we prove things wrong .PERIOD 
And gradually ,COMMA we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world .PERIOD 
As I pursued my career ,COMMA something was always gnawing away inside me .PERIOD 
What about those kids I'd left behind ?QUESTIONMARK 
Instead of developing ,COMMA as we'd all hoped in the '60s ,COMMA things had gotten worse .PERIOD 
Africa was gripped by poverty ,COMMA disease and war .PERIOD 
This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project .PERIOD 
And so the idea is to represent each country on a map ,COMMA but scale the area according to some quantity .PERIOD 
So here's just the standard area map of the world .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA Africa is very large .PERIOD 
And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in <NUM> ,COMMA around the time of independence for many African states .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is <NUM> ,COMMA and then <NUM> .PERIOD And here's a projection for <NUM> .PERIOD 
Big changes are happening in the world ,COMMA but they're not helping Africa .PERIOD 
What about Africa's population ?QUESTIONMARK The population isn't out of proportion to its area ,COMMA but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes :COLON malnutrition ,COMMA simple infections and birth complications .PERIOD 
Then there's HIV/AIDS .PERIOD And then there are deaths from war .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA currently there are <NUM> people a month dying in the Congo ,COMMA as a consequence of the war there over coltan and diamonds and other things .PERIOD 
Here's the number of people in higher education .PERIOD 
And here -DASH -DASH most shocking to me -DASH -DASH the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa .PERIOD 
It just doesn't exist scientifically .PERIOD 
And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa :COLON that all of the aid that's been given has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the transition to democracy in South Africa in <NUM> was literally a dream come true for many of us .PERIOD 
My parents were both elected to the first parliament ,COMMA alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela .PERIOD They were the only other couple .PERIOD 
And in <NUM> ,COMMA I took a research leave to visit them .PERIOD 
But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills ,COMMA especially mathematical skills ,COMMA in industry ,COMMA in government ,COMMA in education .PERIOD 
The ability to make and test models has become essential ,COMMA not only to every single area of science today ,COMMA but also to modern society itself .PERIOD 
And if you don't have math ,COMMA you're not going to enter the modern age .PERIOD 
So I had an idea .PERIOD And the idea was very simple .PERIOD 
The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ,COMMA or AIMS .PERIOD 
And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa ,COMMA bring them together with lecturers from all over the world ,COMMA and we'll try to give them a fantastic education .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA as a Cambridge professor ,COMMA I had many contacts .PERIOD 
And to my astonishment ,COMMA they backed me <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA Go and do it ,COMMA and we'll come and lecture .PERIOD 
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -DASH -DASH where they don't have any opportunities -DASH -DASH together with the best lecturers in the world -DASH -DASH who I knew would come ,COMMA because of the interest in Africa -DASH -DASH and put them together and just let the sparks fly .PERIOD 
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town .PERIOD 
It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s .PERIOD 
The area was kind of seedy ,COMMA so we got an 80-room hotel for <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
It's a beautiful building .PERIOD We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word :COLON we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the new South Africa is a very exciting country .PERIOD 
And those of you who haven't been there ,COMMA you should go .PERIOD 
It's very ,COMMA very interesting what's happening .PERIOD 
And we recruited wonderful staff ,COMMA highly motivated staff .PERIOD 
The other thing that's happened ,COMMA which was good for us ,COMMA is the Internet .PERIOD 
Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa ,COMMA there are Internet cafes everywhere .PERIOD 
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community ,COMMA to be successful -DASH -DASH and they're very ambitious .PERIOD 
They want to be the next Einstein .PERIOD 
And so when word came out that AIMS was opening ,COMMA it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment ,COMMA and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning .PERIOD 
And that's really exciting .PERIOD 
So we designed it to have interactive teaching .PERIOD 
We emphasize problem-solving ,COMMA working in groups ,COMMA every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades .PERIOD 
The students don't usually leave the computer lab till <NUM> or <NUM> a.m .PERIOD 
And then they're up again at eight in the morning .PERIOD 
Lectures ,COMMA problem-solving and so on .PERIOD It's an extraordinary place .PERIOD 
They'll do well .PERIOD They'll have successful careers .PERIOD 
Here is a list of last year's graduates ,COMMA graduated in June ,COMMA and what they're currently doing -DASH -DASH <NUM> of them .PERIOD 
And where they are is indicated over here .PERIOD 
And where they've gone .PERIOD So these are all postgraduate students .PERIOD 
And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D .PERIOD degrees in excellent places .PERIOD 
But more important ,COMMA the pan-African student body is a continual source of strength ,COMMA pride and commitment to Africa .PERIOD 
We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa .PERIOD 
So here you can see behind this list .PERIOD 
When a county is colored yellow ,COMMA we've received an application ;SEMICOLON orange ,COMMA we've accepted an application ;SEMICOLON and green ,COMMA a student has graduated .PERIOD 
So here is where we were after the first graduation in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green .PERIOD 
So there's <NUM> ,COMMA -6 ,COMMA -7 ,COMMA -8 .PERIOD 
We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal .PERIOD 
We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS .PERIOD 
And I'll just show you one .PERIOD 
Tendai Mugwagwa :COLON My name is Tendai Mugwagwa .PERIOD 
I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree .PERIOD 
I will be attending AIMS .PERIOD 
My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA from physics to medicine ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA epidemiology and also mathematical modeling .PERIOD 
Neil Turok :COLON So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well .PERIOD 
And I'll let her take it from there .PERIOD 
My name is Tendai Mugwagwa and I was a student at AIMS in <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
After leaving AIMS ,COMMA I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town in South Africa .PERIOD 
After that ,COMMA I came to the Netherlands where I'm now doing a Ph.D .PERIOD in theoretical immunology .PERIOD 
Professor :COLON Tendai is working very independently .PERIOD 
So all in all I have a very good Ph.D .PERIOD student from South Africa .PERIOD 
So I'm happy she's here .PERIOD 
Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu .PERIOD 
And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher .PERIOD 
And then entering university in northern Nigeria .PERIOD 
And after AIMS ,COMMA Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics ,COMMA and he came to Cambridge .PERIOD 
He's about to finish his Ph.D. ,COMMA and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .PERIOD 
Shehu :COLON And from there we will be able to ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA make better predictions and then we compare it to the graph and also make some predictions .PERIOD 
Stephen Hawking :COLON That is nice .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we had a party .PERIOD This is Africa -DASH -DASH we have good parties in Africa .PERIOD And last month ,COMMA they threw a surprise party for me .PERIOD 
Here's somebody you've seen already .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we were having a party ,COMMA as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point .PERIOD 
This is Ezra .PERIOD She's from Darfur .PERIOD 
She's a physicist ,COMMA and somehow stays smiling ,COMMA in spite of everything going on back home .PERIOD 
But she wants to continue in physics ,COMMA and she's doing extremely well .PERIOD 
This is Lydia .PERIOD Lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic .PERIOD 
So now let me get to our TED wish .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's not my TED wish ;SEMICOLON it's our wish ,COMMA as you've already gathered .PERIOD 
In striving for the heights of creative genius ,COMMA we want to give thousands of people the motivation ,COMMA the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa .PERIOD 
Among them will be not only brilliant scientists -DASH -DASH I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS -DASH -DASH they'll also be the African Gates ,COMMA Brins and Pages of the future .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I said we also have a plan .PERIOD And our plan is quite simple .PERIOD 
AIMS is now a proven model .PERIOD 
And what we need to do is to replicate it .PERIOD 
We want to roll out <NUM> AIMS centers in the next five years ,COMMA all over Africa .PERIOD 
Each will have a pan-African student body ,COMMA but specialize in a different area of science .PERIOD 
We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers ,COMMA as it does at AIMS .PERIOD 
And we want to add elements to the curriculum .PERIOD 
The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution ,COMMA and its graduates will form a powerful network ,COMMA working together for peace and progress across the continent .PERIOD 
And here are the ones we've selected .PERIOD 
And each of these centers has a strong local team ,COMMA each is in a beautiful place ,COMMA an interesting place ,COMMA which international lecturers will be happy to visit .PERIOD 
And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .PERIOD 
Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country .PERIOD 
And last November ,COMMA the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology ,COMMA held in Mombasa ,COMMA called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS .PERIOD 
It won't be easy .PERIOD 
At every site there will be huge challenges .PERIOD 
Local scientists must play leading roles and governments must be persuaded to buy in .PERIOD 
Conditions are very difficult ,COMMA but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work .PERIOD 
And we summarize them this way :COLON the institutes have got to be relevant ,COMMA innovative ,COMMA cost-effective and high quality .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because we want Africa to be rich .PERIOD 
Easy to remember the basic rules we need .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA just in ending ,COMMA let me say the only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans .PERIOD 
By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential ,COMMA we can create a step change in Africa's future .PERIOD 
Over time ,COMMA they will contribute to African development and to science in ways we can only imagine .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra ,COMMA and it was a really cool device .PERIOD 
You could play games with it .PERIOD You could program it in BASIC .PERIOD 
And I was fascinated .PERIOD 
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work .PERIOD 
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory ,COMMA the RAM and the ALU ,COMMA the arithmetic and logic unit .PERIOD 
And I thought to myself ,COMMA this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system .PERIOD 
When computers were first introduced ,COMMA they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .PERIOD 
People were really excited .PERIOD They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain ?QUESTIONMARK 
What people didn't realize ,COMMA and I'm just beginning to realize right now ,COMMA is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers .PERIOD 
Let's take a look at some numbers .PERIOD 
This is Blue Gene ,COMMA the fastest computer in the world .PERIOD 
It's got <NUM> processors ;SEMICOLON they can basically process <NUM> quadrillion bits of information per second .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> to the sixteenth .PERIOD And they consume one and a half megawatts of power .PERIOD 
So that would be really great ,COMMA if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania .PERIOD 
It would really boost the economy .PERIOD 
Just to go back to the States ,COMMA if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States ,COMMA you get <NUM> households in the U.S .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's compare this with the brain .PERIOD 
This is a picture of ,COMMA actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain .PERIOD 
He studies the brain using MRI ,COMMA and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned .PERIOD 
So that's true love ,COMMA right there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA how much computation does the brain do ?QUESTIONMARK 
So that's the question .PERIOD The question is ,COMMA how much -DASH -DASH they are doing a similar amount of processing ,COMMA similar amount of data -DASH -DASH the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer :COLON it's just <NUM> watts .PERIOD 
So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by <NUM> houses ,COMMA the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop .PERIOD 
So the question is ,COMMA how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency ?QUESTIONMARK 
How is the brain able to do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's just take a look about how the brain works ,COMMA and then I'll compare that with how computers work .PERIOD 
It shows you these cells that process information .PERIOD 
They are called neurons .PERIOD 
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other ,COMMA and where they contact each other ,COMMA those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other .PERIOD 
That process is called a synapse .PERIOD 
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other -DASH -DASH about <NUM> million of them ,COMMA sending about <NUM> quadrillion of these pulses around every second .PERIOD 
How does that compare with the way computers work ?QUESTIONMARK 
In the computer ,COMMA you have all the data going through the central processing unit ,COMMA and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck ,COMMA whereas in the brain ,COMMA what you have is these neurons ,COMMA and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons .PERIOD There's no bottleneck here .PERIOD 
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word .PERIOD 
The net is doing the work in the brain .PERIOD 
If you just look at these two pictures ,COMMA these kind of words pop into your mind .PERIOD 
This is serial and it's rigid -DASH -DASH it's like cars on a freeway ,COMMA everything has to happen in lockstep -DASH -DASH whereas this is parallel and it's fluid .PERIOD 
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive .PERIOD 
So I'm not the first to figure this out .PERIOD This is a quote from Brian Eno :COLON the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them .PERIOD 
Brian actually said this in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And nobody was listening then ,COMMA but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing ,COMMA technological problem that we face .PERIOD 
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .PERIOD 
This is -DASH -DASH it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers ,COMMA and the devices that our brains use to compute .PERIOD 
This electrode here ,COMMA called the gate ,COMMA controls the flow of current from the source to the drain -DASH -DASH these two electrodes .PERIOD 
And that current ,COMMA electrical current ,COMMA is carried by electrons ,COMMA just like in your house and so on .PERIOD 
And what you have here is ,COMMA when you actually turn on the gate ,COMMA you get an increase in the amount of current ,COMMA and you get a steady flow of current .PERIOD 
And when you turn off the gate ,COMMA there's no current flowing through the device .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller ,COMMA they no longer behave like this .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute ,COMMA which is called an ion channel .PERIOD 
And this is a little protein molecule .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA neurons have thousands of these .PERIOD 
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it .PERIOD 
And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this pore can open and close .PERIOD 
And even when you close the pore -DASH -DASH which neurons can do ,COMMA they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity -DASH -DASH even when it's closed ,COMMA because these ions are so small ,COMMA they can actually sneak through ,COMMA a few can sneak through at a time .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what you have is that when the pore is open ,COMMA you get some current sometimes .PERIOD 
These are your ones ,COMMA but you've got a few zeros thrown in .PERIOD 
And when it's closed ,COMMA you have a zero ,COMMA but you have a few ones thrown in .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is starting to happen in transistors .PERIOD 
And the reason why that's happening is that ,COMMA right now ,COMMA in <NUM> -DASH -DASH the technology that we are using -DASH -DASH a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously ,COMMA side by side .PERIOD 
And that means that a transistor corresponds to about <NUM> ion channels in parallel .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in a few years time ,COMMA by <NUM> ,COMMA we will shrink transistors so much .PERIOD 
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip .PERIOD 
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them -DASH -DASH before ,COMMA it was <NUM> .PERIOD 
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen ,COMMA and technology has really benefitted from that .PERIOD 
But what's happening now is that in <NUM> ,COMMA the transistor is going to become so small ,COMMA that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel ,COMMA and that corresponds to a single ion channel .PERIOD 
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel .PERIOD 
The current will turn on and off at random ,COMMA even when it's supposed to be on .PERIOD 
And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up ,COMMA and that's going to crash your machine .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices .PERIOD 
And the only kind of thing -DASH -DASH the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory ,COMMA it sends it into the processor or the ALU ,COMMA and then it puts the result back into memory .PERIOD 
That's the red path that's highlighted .PERIOD 
The way brains work ,COMMA I told you all ,COMMA you have got all these neurons .PERIOD 
And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons .PERIOD 
So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network .PERIOD 
And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity ,COMMA just by it flowing through the network .PERIOD 
So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern .PERIOD 
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered ,COMMA it doesn't show up over here ,COMMA these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections .PERIOD 
So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero ,COMMA and it doesn't show up ,COMMA there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information .PERIOD 
It makes the brain inherently robust .PERIOD 
What you have here is a system where you store data locally .PERIOD 
And it's brittle ,COMMA because each of these steps has to be flawless ,COMMA otherwise you lose that data ,COMMA whereas in the brain ,COMMA you have a system that stores data in a distributed way ,COMMA and it's robust .PERIOD 
What I want to basically talk about is my dream ,COMMA which is to build a computer that works like the brain .PERIOD 
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years .PERIOD 
And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina ,COMMA which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball .PERIOD 
We didn't do this by actually writing code ,COMMA like you do in a computer .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet .PERIOD 
They want to compress the information -DASH -DASH they just want to send the changes ,COMMA what's new in the image ,COMMA and so on -DASH -DASH and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve ,COMMA to send to the rest of the brain .PERIOD 
Instead of doing this in software ,COMMA or doing those kinds of algorithms ,COMMA we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina .PERIOD 
And they figured out all the different cells ,COMMA and they figured out the network ,COMMA and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip .PERIOD 
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip ,COMMA and the connections among the neurons are represented ,COMMA actually modeled by transistors .PERIOD 
And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain .PERIOD 
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described .PERIOD 
Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like .PERIOD 
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .PERIOD 
And the chip -DASH -DASH I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul ,COMMA who's the student who designed this chip .PERIOD 
Let me explain what you're going to see ,COMMA OK ,COMMA because it's putting out different kinds of information ,COMMA it's not as straightforward as a camera .PERIOD 
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information .PERIOD 
It extracts regions with dark contrast ,COMMA which will show up on the video as red .PERIOD 
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast ,COMMA which will show up on the video as green .PERIOD 
And then it also extracts movement .PERIOD 
When Kareem moves his head to the right ,COMMA you will see this blue activity there ;SEMICOLON it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image ,COMMA that's where it's going from dark to light .PERIOD 
And you also see this yellow activity ,COMMA which represents regions where contrast is decreasing ;SEMICOLON it's going from light to dark .PERIOD 
And these four types of information -DASH -DASH your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it ,COMMA and <NUM> of those fibers send these four types of information .PERIOD 
What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background ,COMMA only on the edges ,COMMA and then in the hair ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send :COLON they want to make it very sparse ,COMMA because that file is smaller .PERIOD And this is what the retina is doing ,COMMA and it's doing it just with the circuitry ,COMMA and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there ,COMMA which we've captured on the chip .PERIOD 
But the point that I want to make -DASH -DASH I'll show you up here .PERIOD 
So this image here is going to look like these ones ,COMMA but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image ,COMMA so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA here you go .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA so that's the idea .PERIOD 
When you stand still ,COMMA you just see the light and dark contrasts .PERIOD 
But when it's moving back and forth ,COMMA the retina picks up these changes .PERIOD 
And that's why ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when you're sitting here and something happens in your background ,COMMA you merely move your eyes to it .PERIOD 
There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it .PERIOD 
So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you .PERIOD 
This is a steel drum here that has been modified ,COMMA and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano .PERIOD 
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer ,COMMA and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought ,COMMA imagination ,COMMA be creative and things like that .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Question for you ,COMMA Kwabena .PERIOD 
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing ,COMMA the future of Africa ,COMMA this conference -DASH -DASH what connections can we make ,COMMA if any ,COMMA between them ?QUESTIONMARK 
Kwabena Boahen :COLON Yes ,COMMA like I said at the beginning ,COMMA I got my first computer when I was a teenager ,COMMA growing up in Accra .PERIOD 
It was very brute force ;SEMICOLON it was very inelegant .PERIOD 
I don't think that I would've had that reaction ,COMMA if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction ,COMMA hearing about RD2D2 ,COMMA whatever it was called ,COMMA and just -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA buying into this hype about computers .PERIOD 
I was coming at it from a different perspective ,COMMA where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .PERIOD 
And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective ,COMMA and I think that's going to impact technology .PERIOD 
And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve .PERIOD 
And I think you're going to be able to see ,COMMA use that infusion ,COMMA to come up with new things ,COMMA because you're coming from a different perspective .PERIOD 
I think we can contribute .PERIOD We can dream like everybody else .PERIOD 
Thanks Kwabena ,COMMA that was really interesting .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
How do you observe something you can't see ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes .PERIOD 
Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it ,COMMA not even light ,COMMA so you can't see it directly .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole .PERIOD 
And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist .PERIOD 
And second ,COMMA it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment ,COMMA and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA to begin with ,COMMA we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what is a black hole ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object ,COMMA because there are only three characteristics that you can describe :COLON the mass ,COMMA the spin ,COMMA and the charge .PERIOD 
And I'm going to only talk about the mass .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in that sense ,COMMA it's a very simple object .PERIOD 
But in another sense ,COMMA it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe ,COMMA and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive ,COMMA and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment ,COMMA it has no finite size .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is a little tricky .PERIOD 
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see ,COMMA and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius .PERIOD 
And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius .PERIOD 
This is a virtual radius ,COMMA not reality ;SEMICOLON the black hole has no size .PERIOD 
It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole .PERIOD 
That means you ,COMMA your neighbor ,COMMA your cellphone ,COMMA the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius .PERIOD 
At that point ,COMMA what's going to happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
At that point gravity wins .PERIOD 
Gravity wins over all other known forces .PERIOD 
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object .PERIOD 
And then it's a black hole .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube ,COMMA it would become a black hole ,COMMA because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius .PERIOD 
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out .PERIOD 
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii .PERIOD 
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford ,COMMA it would become a black hole .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD 
And it's actually quite a useful concept ,COMMA because it tells us not only when a black hole will form ,COMMA but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole .PERIOD 
I only need two things .PERIOD 
I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole ,COMMA and what its Schwarzschild radius is .PERIOD 
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius ,COMMA there is actually only one thing I really need to know .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius .PERIOD 
And your job today is to be skeptical .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so ,COMMA I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole ;SEMICOLON I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is ,COMMA as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole .PERIOD 
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun ,COMMA it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here .PERIOD 
And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun .PERIOD 
On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes .PERIOD 
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies .PERIOD 
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes .PERIOD 
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy .PERIOD 
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left .PERIOD 
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy ,COMMA which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here ,COMMA comes from the light from the stars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we see the galaxy because of the star light .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there are a few relatively exotic galaxies .PERIOD 
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world ,COMMA because they are kind of show offs .PERIOD 
And we call them active galactic nuclei .PERIOD 
And we call them that because their nucleus ,COMMA or their center ,COMMA are very active .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight .PERIOD 
It's way more energetic .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here .PERIOD 
There are also jets emanating out from the center .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies .PERIOD 
But it's a kind of indirect argument .PERIOD 
Nonetheless ,COMMA it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes ,COMMA but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers .PERIOD 
And if that's the case -DASH -DASH and this is an example of a normal galaxy ;SEMICOLON what we see is the star light .PERIOD 
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei .PERIOD 
If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies ,COMMA the best place to look is in our own galaxy ,COMMA our Milky Way .PERIOD 
And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way .PERIOD 
And what we see is a line of stars .PERIOD 
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened ,COMMA disk-like structure .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have ,COMMA because the next closest galaxy is <NUM> times further away .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else .PERIOD 
And as you'll see in a moment ,COMMA the ability to see detail is key to this experiment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which is the job that I have to show you today .PERIOD 
And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .PERIOD 
Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun .PERIOD 
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off ,COMMA or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if I know how fast it goes around ,COMMA I know the mass .PERIOD 
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this means that I want to see a lot of detail .PERIOD 
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope .PERIOD 
This is the Keck observatory .PERIOD It hosts two telescopes with a mirror <NUM> meters ,COMMA which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is wonderful ,COMMA because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope ,COMMA the smaller the detail that we can see .PERIOD 
But it turns out these telescopes ,COMMA or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise .PERIOD 
And that is because of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
Atmosphere is great for us ;SEMICOLON it allows us to survive here on Earth .PERIOD 
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA to give you a sense of what this is like ,COMMA it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream .PERIOD 
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream ,COMMA the stream is continuously moving and turbulent ,COMMA and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream .PERIOD 
Very much in the same way ,COMMA it's very difficult to see astronomical sources ,COMMA because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere ,COMMA to give us a cleaner view .PERIOD 
And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of <NUM> ,COMMA you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot ,COMMA say your salary ,COMMA you'd notice ,COMMA or your kids ,COMMA you'd notice .PERIOD 
And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use ,COMMA called adaptive optics .PERIOD 
You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique -DASH -DASH in other words ,COMMA just a picture that shows the stars -DASH -DASH and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy ,COMMA where we think the black hole is .PERIOD 
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it .PERIOD 
This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square ,COMMA although we've looked at all of them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I want to see how these things have moved .PERIOD 
And over the course of this experiment ,COMMA these stars have moved a tremendous amount .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've been doing this experiment for <NUM> years ,COMMA and we see the stars go all the way around .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA most astronomers have a favorite star ,COMMA and mine today is a star that's labeled up there ,COMMA SO-2 .PERIOD 
Absolutely my favorite star in the world .PERIOD 
And that's because it goes around in only <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And to give you a sense of how short that is ,COMMA the sun takes <NUM> million years to go around the center of the galaxy .PERIOD 
Stars that we knew about before ,COMMA that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible ,COMMA take <NUM> years .PERIOD 
That's kind of profound ,COMMA in a way .PERIOD 
But it's the key to this experiment .PERIOD The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy .PERIOD 
What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle .PERIOD 
And as you can see ,COMMA there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle .PERIOD 
You can see a lot of stars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy ,COMMA because you could put a lot of stuff in there .PERIOD 
But with this experiment ,COMMA we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's <NUM> times smaller .PERIOD 
And because of that ,COMMA we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there .PERIOD 
To give you a sense of how small that size is ,COMMA that's the size of our solar system .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA truth in advertising .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy ,COMMA but any in our universe .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what next ?QUESTIONMARK I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology ,COMMA so let's move on with the problem .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what I want to tell you ,COMMA very briefly ,COMMA is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy ,COMMA now that we know that there is ,COMMA or at least we believe ,COMMA that there is a supermassive black hole there .PERIOD 
And the fun phase of this experiment is ,COMMA while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy ,COMMA almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see .PERIOD 
And that's the fun .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me give you the two examples .PERIOD 
You can ask ,COMMA What do you expect for the old stars ,COMMA stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time ,COMMA they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole .PERIOD 
What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole .PERIOD 
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .PERIOD 
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery .PERIOD 
To get a star to form ,COMMA you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse .PERIOD 
And it's a very fragile entity .PERIOD 
And what does the big black hole do ?QUESTIONMARK 
It strips that gas cloud apart .PERIOD 
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you shouldn't see young stars .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do we see ?QUESTIONMARK 
The young ones are blue .PERIOD And the yellow ones ,COMMA we don't know yet .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can already see the surprise .PERIOD 
There is a dearth of old stars .PERIOD 
There is an abundance of young stars ,COMMA so it's the exact opposite of the prediction .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is the fun part .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA today ,COMMA this is what we're trying to figure out ,COMMA this mystery of how do you get -DASH -DASH how do you resolve this contradiction .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA my graduate students are ,COMMA at this very moment ,COMMA today ,COMMA at the telescope ,COMMA in Hawaii ,COMMA making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage ,COMMA where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars ,COMMA and so few old stars .PERIOD 
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away .PERIOD 
To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA in truth ,COMMA while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere ,COMMA we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced .PERIOD 
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere ,COMMA and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest .PERIOD 
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years .PERIOD 
And on a much longer time scale ,COMMA what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes ,COMMA because ,COMMA remember ,COMMA bigger is better in astronomy .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we want to build a <NUM> meter telescope .PERIOD 
And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy .PERIOD 
And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity ,COMMA some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in conclusion ,COMMA I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving ,COMMA in three dimensions .PERIOD 
And I hope ,COMMA if nothing else ,COMMA I've convinced you that ,COMMA one ,COMMA we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .PERIOD 
And this means that these things do exist in our universe ,COMMA and we have to contend with this ,COMMA we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact ,COMMA and understand ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are ,COMMA and how they work .PERIOD 
And last but not least ,COMMA none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front .PERIOD 
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast ,COMMA and holds a lot in store for the future .PERIOD 
Thanks very much .PERIOD 
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk ,COMMA I was really chuckled ,COMMA because ,COMMA you see ,COMMA my father's name was Ted ,COMMA and much of my life ,COMMA especially my musical life ,COMMA is really a talk that I'm still having with him ,COMMA or the part of me that he continues to be .PERIOD 
Now Ted was a New Yorker ,COMMA an all-around theater guy ,COMMA and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA he was my greatest teacher .PERIOD 
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids ,COMMA his understanding of music was profound .PERIOD 
And for him ,COMMA it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you .PERIOD 
And he did a painting of this experience ,COMMA which he called In the Realm of Music .PERIOD 
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this .PERIOD 
But he was tough when it came to music .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA There are only two things that matter in music :COLON what and how .PERIOD 
That was his passion for the music .PERIOD 
Both my parents really loved it .PERIOD 
They didn't know all that much about it ,COMMA but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them .PERIOD 
And I think inspired by that memory ,COMMA it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can ,COMMA sort of pass it on through whatever means .PERIOD 
And how people get this music ,COMMA how it comes into their lives ,COMMA really fascinates me .PERIOD 
One day in New York ,COMMA I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .PERIOD 
And he watched the ball fly for a second ,COMMA and then he went ,COMMA Dah dadaratatatah .PERIOD 
And he ran around the bases .PERIOD 
And I thought ,COMMA go figure .PERIOD 
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid ?QUESTIONMARK 
How was that passed on ?QUESTIONMARK How did he get to hear Mozart ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well when it comes to classical music ,COMMA there's an awful lot to pass on ,COMMA much more than Mozart ,COMMA Beethoven or Tchiakovsky .PERIOD 
Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it's like to be alive .PERIOD 
Now the raw material of it ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is just the music of everyday life .PERIOD 
It's all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches .PERIOD 
But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down ,COMMA to condense them to their absolute essence ,COMMA and from that essence create a new language ,COMMA a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are .PERIOD 
It's a language that's still evolving .PERIOD 
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of ,COMMA like concertos and symphonies ,COMMA but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment -DASH -DASH like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto .PERIOD 
It's so simple ,COMMA so evocative .PERIOD 
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA of course ,COMMA like all music ,COMMA it's essentially not about anything .PERIOD 
It's just a design of pitches and silence and time .PERIOD 
And the pitches ,COMMA the notes ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA are just vibrations .PERIOD 
They're locations in the spectrum of sound .PERIOD 
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .PERIOD 
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries ,COMMA as have our preferences for them .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA in the 11th century ,COMMA people liked pieces that ended like this .PERIOD 
And in the 21st century .. .PERIOD 
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord ,COMMA even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room .PERIOD 
And the reason you like it is because you've inherited ,COMMA whether you knew it or not ,COMMA centuries-worth of changes in musical theory ,COMMA practice and fashion .PERIOD 
And in classical music we can follow these changes very ,COMMA very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner ,COMMA the way it's been passed on :COLON notation .PERIOD 
Now the impulse to notate ,COMMA or ,COMMA more exactly I should say ,COMMA encode music has been with us for a very long time .PERIOD 
In <NUM> B.C. ,COMMA a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks .PERIOD 
And a thousand years later ,COMMA this impulse to notate took an entirely different form .PERIOD 
And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass Puer Natus est nobis ,COMMA For Us is Born .PERIOD 
In the 10th century ,COMMA little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune .PERIOD 
And in the 12th century ,COMMA a line was drawn ,COMMA like a musical horizon line ,COMMA to better pinpoint the pitch's location .PERIOD 
And then in the 13th century ,COMMA more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly ,COMMA and that led to the kind of notation we have today .PERIOD 
Well notation not only passed the music on ,COMMA notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely ,COMMA because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale .PERIOD 
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded ,COMMA saved ,COMMA considered ,COMMA prioritized ,COMMA made into intricate designs .PERIOD 
And from this moment ,COMMA classical music became what it most essentially is ,COMMA a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature :COLON instinct and intelligence .PERIOD 
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move ,COMMA but a composer is considering all possible moves ,COMMA testing them out ,COMMA prioritizing them out ,COMMA until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness .PERIOD 
Now some of the greatest composers ,COMMA like Bach ,COMMA were combinations of these two things .PERIOD 
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master .PERIOD 
Mozart was the same way .PERIOD 
But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason ,COMMA instinct and intelligence .PERIOD 
And every musical era had different priorities of these things ,COMMA different things to pass on ,COMMA different 'whats' and 'hows' .PERIOD 
And by the 1400s ,COMMA music was being written that tried to mirror God's mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .PERIOD 
This was truly the music of the spheres .PERIOD 
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known .PERIOD 
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen -DASH -DASH a radical new move ,COMMA which in <NUM> is what did happen .PERIOD 
Singer :COLON Ah ,COMMA bitter blow !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Ah ,COMMA wicked ,COMMA cruel fate !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Ah ,COMMA baleful stars !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
MTT :COLON This ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was the birth of opera ,COMMA and its development put music on a radical new course .PERIOD 
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God ,COMMA but to follow the emotion turbulence of man .PERIOD 
And the how was harmony ,COMMA stacking up the pitches to form chords .PERIOD 
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us ,COMMA the triads ,COMMA either the major one ,COMMA which we think is happy ,COMMA or the minor one ,COMMA which we perceive as sad .PERIOD 
But what's the actual difference between these two chords ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's either E natural ,COMMA and <NUM> vibrations per second ,COMMA or E flat ,COMMA at <NUM> .PERIOD 
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> freakin' vibrations .PERIOD 
So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature ,COMMA harmony grew more complex to reflect it .PERIOD 
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .PERIOD 
Now with all this possibility ,COMMA classical music really took off .PERIOD 
It's the time in which the big forms began to arise .PERIOD 
And the effects of technology began to be felt also ,COMMA because printing put music ,COMMA the scores ,COMMA the codebooks of music ,COMMA into the hands of performers everywhere .PERIOD 
And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible .PERIOD 
This is when those big forms arose -DASH -DASH the symphonies ,COMMA the sonatas ,COMMA the concertos .PERIOD 
And in these big architectures of time ,COMMA composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime .PERIOD 
A piece like Beethoven's Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger ,COMMA over the course of a half an hour ,COMMA step by exacting step of his route ,COMMA to the moment when he could make it across to joy .PERIOD 
But whatever direction the music took ,COMMA one thing until recently was always the same ,COMMA and that was when the musicians stopped playing ,COMMA the music stopped .PERIOD 
Now this moment so fascinates me .PERIOD 
I find it such a profound one .PERIOD 
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how might that change their lives ?QUESTIONMARK 
To me this is the intimate ,COMMA personal side of music .PERIOD 
And to me that's the most essential of all .PERIOD 
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing ,COMMA a teacher-student ,COMMA performer-audience thing ,COMMA and then around <NUM> came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on ,COMMA albeit an impersonal one .PERIOD 
People could now hear music all the time ,COMMA even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument ,COMMA read music or even go to concerts .PERIOD 
And technology democratized music by making everything available .PERIOD 
It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing .PERIOD 
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes ,COMMA using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences .PERIOD 
The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that's been sliced ,COMMA diced ,COMMA layered and ,COMMA God knows ,COMMA distributed and sold .PERIOD 
The question remains :COLON What happens when the music stops ?QUESTIONMARK 
What sticks with people ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now that we have unlimited access to music ,COMMA what does stick with us ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well let me show you a story of what I mean by really sticking with us .PERIOD 
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home ,COMMA and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker .PERIOD 
He came over to a piano that was there ,COMMA and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .PERIOD 
And he said something like ,COMMA Me .. .PERIOD boy .. .PERIOD symphony .. .PERIOD Beethoven .PERIOD 
And I suddenly got it ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Friend ,COMMA by any chance are you trying to play this ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA yes .PERIOD I was a little boy .PERIOD 
The symphony :COLON Isaac Stern ,COMMA the concerto ,COMMA I heard it .PERIOD 
And I thought ,COMMA my God ,COMMA how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed ,COMMA across the room to recover the memory of this music that ,COMMA after everything else in his life is sloughing away ,COMMA still means so much to him ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA that's why I take every performance so seriously ,COMMA why it matters to me so much .PERIOD 
I never know who might be there ,COMMA who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life .PERIOD 
But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music .PERIOD 
That's what drives my interest in projects like the TV series Keeping Score with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music ,COMMA and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world .PERIOD 
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .PERIOD 
Sure ,COMMA the big events attract a lot of attention ,COMMA but what really matters is what goes on every single day .PERIOD 
We need your perspectives ,COMMA your curiosity ,COMMA your voices .PERIOD 
And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers ,COMMA chefs ,COMMA code writers ,COMMA taxi drivers ,COMMA people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on .PERIOD 
You don't need to worry about knowing anything .PERIOD 
If you're curious ,COMMA if you have a capacity for wonder ,COMMA if you're alive ,COMMA you know all that you need to know .PERIOD 
Follow traces .PERIOD Get lost .PERIOD Be surprised ,COMMA amused inspired .PERIOD 
All that 'what' ,COMMA all that 'how' is out there waiting for you to discover its 'why' ,COMMA to dive in and pass it on .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
If you're at all like me ,COMMA this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco :COLON you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils capable of more than <NUM> knots .PERIOD 
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind ,COMMA and it can do amazing things .PERIOD 
And one day ,COMMA a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record .PERIOD 
But kites aren't just toys like this .PERIOD 
Kites :COLON I'm going to give you a brief history ,COMMA and tell you about the magnificent future of every child's favorite plaything .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA kites are more than a thousand years old ,COMMA and the Chinese used them for military applications ,COMMA and even for lifting men .PERIOD 
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights .PERIOD 
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA a fellow called George Pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the English countryside .PERIOD 
Then of course ,COMMA at the dawn of aviation ,COMMA all of the great inventors of the time -DASH -DASH like Hargreaves ,COMMA like Langley ,COMMA even Alexander Graham Bell ,COMMA inventor of the telephone ,COMMA who was flying this kite -DASH -DASH were doing so in the pursuit of aviation .PERIOD 
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright ,COMMA and the Wright Flyer .PERIOD 
And their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion ,COMMA where we powered up and took off for the first-ever 12-second human flight .PERIOD 
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation .PERIOD 
That was until the 1970s ,COMMA where we had the last energy crisis .PERIOD 
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco ,COMMA wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the Journal of Energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity .PERIOD 
The real key observation he made is that a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine .PERIOD 
So turbines grew .PERIOD And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height ,COMMA but they can't really go a lot higher ,COMMA and more height is where the more wind is ,COMMA and more power -DASH -DASH as much as twice as much .PERIOD 
So cut to now .PERIOD We still have an energy crisis ,COMMA and now we have a climate crisis as well .PERIOD You know ,COMMA so humans generate about <NUM> trillion watts ,COMMA or <NUM> terawatts ,COMMA from fossil fuels .PERIOD 
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets ,COMMA and in reality what that means is in the next <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA we have to make <NUM> trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow .PERIOD 
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar :COLON <NUM> terawatts ,COMMA more than enough to supply humanity <NUM> times over .PERIOD 
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes ,COMMA above <NUM> feet ,COMMA where we don't have a technology as yet to get there .PERIOD 
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites .PERIOD 
This is our test site on Maui ,COMMA flying across the sky .PERIOD 
I'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power by every child's favorite plaything .PERIOD 
As you can tell ,COMMA you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours .PERIOD 
It makes you a little nauseous .PERIOD 
And here we're actually generating about <NUM> kilowatts -DASH -DASH so ,COMMA enough to power probably five United States households -DASH -DASH with a kite not much larger than this piano .PERIOD 
And the real significant thing here is we're developing the control systems ,COMMA as did the Wright brothers ,COMMA that would enable sustained ,COMMA long-duration flight .PERIOD 
So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow -DASH -DASH that's tracing your name in the sky .PERIOD 
And this is where we're actually going .PERIOD 
So we're beyond the 12-second steps .PERIOD 
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines that fly at <NUM> feet and generate tons of clean electricity .PERIOD 
So you ask ,COMMA how big are those machines ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA this paper plane would be maybe a -DASH -DASH oop !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
That would be enough to power your cell phone .PERIOD 
Your Cessna would be <NUM> killowatts .PERIOD 
If you give me a <NUM> ,COMMA I'll make six megawatts ,COMMA which is more than the largest wind turbines today .PERIOD 
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .PERIOD 
So that is audacious ,COMMA you say .PERIOD I agree .PERIOD 
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history .PERIOD 
This is a refrigerator factory ,COMMA churning out airplanes for World War II .PERIOD 
Prior to World War II ,COMMA they were making <NUM> planes a year .PERIOD 
By <NUM> ,COMMA they were making <NUM> .PERIOD 
With this factory and <NUM> planes a year ,COMMA we could make all of America's electricity in about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people with these dreams .PERIOD There are many of us .PERIOD 
I am lucky enough to work with <NUM> of them .PERIOD 
And I think we need to support all of the dreams of the kids out there doing these crazy things .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
If nothing else ,COMMA at least I've discovered what it is we put our speakers through :COLON sweaty palms ,COMMA sleepless nights ,COMMA a wholly unnatural fear of clocks .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's quite brutal .PERIOD 
And I'm also a little nervous about this .PERIOD 
There are nine billion humans coming our way .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the most optimistic dreams can get dented by the prospect of people plundering the planet .PERIOD 
But recently ,COMMA I've become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds ,COMMA because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool .PERIOD 
It's a phenomenon that I think any organization or individual can tap into .PERIOD 
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future ,COMMA and perhaps the world's future overall .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's explore .PERIOD 
This kid is known online as Lil Demon .PERIOD 
He's doing tricks here ,COMMA dance tricks ,COMMA that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before .PERIOD 
How did he learn them ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice this must have taken ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here's a clue .PERIOD 
Lil Demon :COLON ♫ Step your game up .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD ♫ ♫ Step your game up .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD Oh .PERIOD ♫ Chris Anderson :COLON So ,COMMA that was sent to me by this man ,COMMA a filmmaker ,COMMA Jonathan Chu ,COMMA who told me that was the moment he realized the Internet was causing dance to evolve .PERIOD 
This is what he said at TED in February .PERIOD 
In essence ,COMMA dancers were challenging each other online to get better ;SEMICOLON incredible new dance skills were being invented ;SEMICOLON even the six-year-olds were joining in .PERIOD 
It felt like a revolution .PERIOD 
And so Jon had a brilliant idea :COLON He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of YouTube to create this dance troupe -DASH -DASH The League of Extraordinary Dancers ,COMMA the LXD .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA these kids were web-taught ,COMMA but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year .PERIOD 
And at TED here in February ,COMMA their passion and brilliance just took our breath away .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA a while after TEDTalks started taking off ,COMMA we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation .PERIOD 
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two .PERIOD 
.. .PERIOD Months of preparation crammed into <NUM> minutes ,COMMA raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers ,COMMA with the effects that we've seen this week .PERIOD 
It's not as if J.J .PERIOD and Jill actually ended their talks saying ,COMMA Step your game up ,COMMA but they might as well have .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in both of these cases ,COMMA you've got these cycles of improvement ,COMMA apparently driven by people watching web video .PERIOD 
What is going on here ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call crowd-accelerated innovation .PERIOD 
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear .PERIOD 
You can think of them as three dials on a giant wheel .PERIOD 
You turn up the dials ,COMMA the wheel starts to turn .PERIOD 
And the first thing you need is .. .PERIOD a crowd ,COMMA a group of people who share a common interest .PERIOD 
The bigger the crowd ,COMMA the more potential innovators there are .PERIOD 
That's important ,COMMA but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles .PERIOD 
The second thing you need is light .PERIOD 
You need clear ,COMMA open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of ,COMMA because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate .PERIOD 
And third ,COMMA you need desire .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA innovation's hard work .PERIOD 
Absent desire ,COMMA not going to happen .PERIOD 
Dancers at a street corner -DASH -DASH it's a crowd ,COMMA a small one ,COMMA but they can all obviously see what each other can do .PERIOD 
And the desire part comes ,COMMA I guess ,COMMA from social status ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Best dancer walks tall ,COMMA gets the best date .PERIOD 
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here .PERIOD 
But on the web ,COMMA all three dials are ratcheted right up .PERIOD 
The dance community is now global .PERIOD 
There's millions connected .PERIOD 
And amazingly ,COMMA you can still see what the best can do ,COMMA because the crowd itself shines a light on them ,COMMA either directly ,COMMA through comments ,COMMA ratings ,COMMA email ,COMMA Facebook ,COMMA Twitter ,COMMA or indirectly ,COMMA through numbers of views ,COMMA through links that point Google there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's easy to find the good stuff ,COMMA and when you've found it ,COMMA you can watch it in close-up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it .PERIOD 
That's a lot of light .PERIOD 
But the desire element is really dialed way up .PERIOD 
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this possibility of a new type of global recognition ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is driving huge amounts of effort .PERIOD 
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting :COLON because you can see the best ,COMMA everyone can learn .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA the system is self-fueling .PERIOD 
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire ,COMMA but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination that attract new people to the crowd .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation .PERIOD 
Invite the crowd ,COMMA let in the light ,COMMA dial up the desire .PERIOD 
And the hardest part about that is probably the light ,COMMA because it means you have to open up ,COMMA you have to show your stuff to the world .PERIOD 
It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA very happily ,COMMA there's one class of people who really can't make use of this tool .PERIOD 
The dark side of the web is allergic to the light .PERIOD 
I don't think we're going to see terrorists ,COMMA for example ,COMMA publishing their plans online and saying to the world ,COMMA Please ,COMMA could you help us to actually make them work this time ?QUESTIONMARK 
But you can publish your stuff online .PERIOD 
And if you can get that wheel to turn ,COMMA look out .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA at TED ,COMMA we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness .PERIOD 
We opened up our talks to the world ,COMMA and suddenly there are millions of people out there helping spread our speakers' ideas ,COMMA and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers .PERIOD 
By opening up our translation program ,COMMA thousands of heroic volunteers -DASH -DASH some of them watching online right now ,COMMA and thank you !EXCLAMATIONMARK -DASH -DASH have translated our talks into more than <NUM> languages ,COMMA thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries .PERIOD 
And these organizers ,COMMA they're seeing each other ,COMMA they're learning from each other .PERIOD 
We are learning from them .PERIOD 
We're getting great talks back from them .PERIOD 
The wheel is turning .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA step back a minute .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we've heard that this week -DASH -DASH this romantic notion of the lone genius with the eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK moment that changes the world is misleading .PERIOD 
Even he said that ,COMMA and he would know .PERIOD 
We spark off each other .PERIOD 
It's also not news to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation .PERIOD 
For the past <NUM> years ,COMMA powerful communities have been connecting online ,COMMA sparking off each other .PERIOD 
If you take programmers ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the whole open-source movement is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation .PERIOD 
But what's key here is ,COMMA the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally -DASH -DASH a picture ,COMMA a music file ,COMMA software .PERIOD 
This is the technology that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally ,COMMA thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation .PERIOD 
The first few years of the web were pretty much video-free ,COMMA for this reason :COLON video files are huge ;SEMICOLON the web couldn't handle them .PERIOD 
But in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA here we are .PERIOD 
Humanity watches <NUM> million hours of YouTube every day .PERIOD 
Cisco actually estimates that ,COMMA within four years ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of the web's data will be video .PERIOD 
If it's all puppies ,COMMA porn and piracy ,COMMA we're doomed .PERIOD 
I don't think it will be .PERIOD 
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason .PERIOD 
It packs a huge amount of data ,COMMA and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA let me introduce you to Sam Haber .PERIOD 
Before YouTube ,COMMA there was no way for him to discover his sport's true potential ,COMMA because you can't communicate this stuff in words ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
But looking at video clips posted by strangers ,COMMA a world of possibility opens up for him .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA he starts to emulate and then to innovate .PERIOD 
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online ,COMMA inspire each other to greatness .PERIOD 
And there are thousands of other examples of this happening -DASH -DASH of video-driven evolution of skills ,COMMA ranging from the physical to the artful .PERIOD 
And I have to tell you ,COMMA as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines ,COMMA I find this strangely beautiful .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA there's a lot of passion right here on this screen .PERIOD 
But if Rube Goldberg machines and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea ,COMMA how about this .PERIOD 
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper .PERIOD 
It can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print .PERIOD 
Here's one such frustrated scientist ,COMMA Moshe Pritsker ,COMMA the founder of Jove .PERIOD 
He told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this .PERIOD 
But look at this video .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA look :COLON if you can show instead of just describing ,COMMA that problem goes away .PERIOD 
So it's not far-fetched to say that ,COMMA at some point ,COMMA online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance .PERIOD 
Here's another example that's close to our hearts at TED ,COMMA where video is sometimes more powerful than print -DASH -DASH the sharing of an idea .PERIOD 
All those ideas are already out there in print .PERIOD 
It's actually faster to read than to view .PERIOD 
Why would someone bother ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA so ,COMMA there's some showing as well as telling .PERIOD 
But even leaving the screen out of it ,COMMA there's still a lot more being transferred than just words .PERIOD 
And in that non-verbal portion ,COMMA there's some serious magic .PERIOD 
Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures ,COMMA the vocal cadence ,COMMA the facial expressions ,COMMA the eye contact ,COMMA the passion ,COMMA the kind of awkward ,COMMA British body language ,COMMA the sense of how the audience are reacting ,COMMA there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand ,COMMA and whether you're inspired -DASH -DASH light ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA and desire .PERIOD 
Incredibly ,COMMA all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen .PERIOD 
Reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions .PERIOD 
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution .PERIOD 
That's what's made it into this mysterious ,COMMA powerful thing it is .PERIOD 
Someone speaks ,COMMA there's resonance in all these receiving brains ,COMMA the whole group acts together .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action .PERIOD 
It's probably driven our culture for millennia .PERIOD 
It's right here .PERIOD 
Print scaled .PERIOD 
The world's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide ,COMMA and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine .PERIOD 
But now ,COMMA in the blink of an eye ,COMMA the game has changed again .PERIOD 
It's not too much to say that what Gutenberg did for writing ,COMMA online video can now do for face-to-face communication .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that primal medium ,COMMA which your brain is exquisitely wired for .. .PERIOD 
that just went global .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is big .PERIOD 
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form .PERIOD 
For the first time in human history ,COMMA talented students don't have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers .PERIOD 
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA TED is just a small part of this .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA the world's universities are opening up their curricula .PERIOD 
Thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online .PERIOD 
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process ,COMMA one-to-many .PERIOD 
Our future is many-to-many .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're dreaming of ways to make it easier for you ,COMMA the global TED community ,COMMA to respond to speakers ,COMMA to contribute your own ideas ,COMMA maybe even your own TEDTalks ,COMMA and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool ,COMMA this wheel turns .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA is it possible to imagine a similar process to this ,COMMA happening to global education overall ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA does it have to be this painful ,COMMA top-down process ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why not a self-fueling cycle in which we all can participate ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's the participation age ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Schools can't be silos .PERIOD 
We can't stop learning at age <NUM> .PERIOD 
What if ,COMMA in the coming crowd of nine billion .. .PERIOD 
what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors ,COMMA instead of net plunderers ?QUESTIONMARK 
That changes everything ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA that would take more teachers than we've ever had .PERIOD 
But the good news is they are out there .PERIOD 
They're in the crowd ,COMMA and the crowd is switching on lights ,COMMA and we can see them for the first time ,COMMA not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers ,COMMA but as individuals we can learn from .PERIOD 
Who's the teacher ?QUESTIONMARK 
You're the teacher .PERIOD 
You're part of the crowd that may be about to launch the biggest learning cycle in human history ,COMMA a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter ,COMMA wiser ,COMMA more beautiful place .PERIOD 
Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up .PERIOD 
Within five years ,COMMA each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full-on web video and capable of uploading video to the web .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA is it crazy to think that this girl ,COMMA in the back ,COMMA at the right ,COMMA in <NUM> years ,COMMA might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not crazy ;SEMICOLON it's actually happening right now .PERIOD 
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown .PERIOD 
Christopher Makau :COLON Hi .PERIOD My name is Christopher Makau .PERIOD 
I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera .PERIOD 
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera .PERIOD 
There's a self-help group .PERIOD 
They turned a trash place into a garden .PERIOD 
The same spot ,COMMA it was a crime spot where people were being robbed .PERIOD 
The same trash site is feeding more than <NUM> families .PERIOD 
We have our own film school .PERIOD 
They are using Flip cameras to record ,COMMA edit ,COMMA and reporting to their own channel ,COMMA Kibera TV .PERIOD 
Because of a scarcity of land ,COMMA we are using the sacks to grow vegetables ,COMMA and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living .PERIOD 
Change happens when we see things in a different way .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA I see Kibera in a different way .PERIOD 
My message to TEDGlobal and the entire world is :COLON Kibera is a hotbed of innovation and ideas .PERIOD 
You know what ?QUESTIONMARK 
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy .PERIOD 
What's new -DASH -DASH and it's huge -DASH -DASH is that ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA we get to see him ,COMMA and he can see us .PERIOD 
Right now ,COMMA Chris and Kevin and Dennis and Dickson and their friends are watching us ,COMMA in Nairobi ,COMMA right now .PERIOD 
Guys ,COMMA we've learned from you today .PERIOD 
And thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Like the speaker before me ,COMMA I am -DASH -DASH that's the TED virgin ,COMMA I guess -DASH -DASH I'm also the first time here ,COMMA and I don't know what to say .PERIOD 
I'm really happy that Mr .PERIOD Anderson invited me .PERIOD 
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone .PERIOD 
And the song that I just played was by Józef Hofmann .PERIOD 
It's called Kaleidoscope .PERIOD 
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century ,COMMA and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time .PERIOD 
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you .PERIOD 
It's called Abegg Variations ,COMMA by Robert Schumann ,COMMA a German 19th century composer .PERIOD 
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends .PERIOD 
But he wrote that for his wife .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if you listen carefully ,COMMA there's supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme .PERIOD 
It's written around <NUM> ,COMMA so ,COMMA even though it's old ,COMMA I hope you like it .PERIOD 
Now comes the part that I hate .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA because Mr .PERIOD Anderson told me that this session is called Sync and Flow ,COMMA I was wondering ,COMMA What do I know that these geniuses don't ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA I'll talk about musical composition ,COMMA even though I don't know where to start .PERIOD 
How do I compose ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose .PERIOD 
And once I choose my main theme I have to decide ,COMMA out of all the styles in music ,COMMA what kind of style do I want ?QUESTIONMARK 
And this year I composed a Romantic style .PERIOD 
Next ,COMMA I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers .PERIOD 
They help me plan out the whole piece ,COMMA and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas ,COMMA because then you have to think .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -DASH -DASH solidified ,COMMA excuse me -DASH -DASH solidified form ,COMMA you're supposed to actually polish the piece ,COMMA polish the details ,COMMA and then polish the overall performance of the composition .PERIOD 
And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing -DASH -DASH drawing ,COMMA because I like to draw ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Japanese anime art .PERIOD 
I think that's a craze among teens right now .PERIOD 
And then you want to decide ,COMMA how are you going to draw the character ?QUESTIONMARK 
Am I going to draw it on the computer ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character ,COMMA which is like your structure of a piece ,COMMA and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need -DASH -DASH that's polishing the drawing .PERIOD 
And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind ,COMMA because I don't -DASH -DASH I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted ,COMMA so if I'm trying to do homework ,COMMA if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it ,COMMA I'll try to draw or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA waste my time .PERIOD 
And then what happens is ,COMMA sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all ,COMMA and then it's like there's too much on your mind .PERIOD 
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do .PERIOD 
And sometimes ,COMMA if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it ,COMMA you'll get something out of it ,COMMA but it doesn't come naturally .PERIOD 
What happens is ,COMMA if something magical happens ,COMMA if something natural happens to you ,COMMA you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly ,COMMA and then that's what I consider flow ,COMMA because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything .PERIOD 
You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want .PERIOD 
I'm not going to play my own composition today because ,COMMA although I did finish it ,COMMA it's way too long .PERIOD 
I have here seven note cards ,COMMA one with each note of the musical alphabet ,COMMA and I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -DASH -DASH anyone to come up here and choose five -DASH -DASH and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I'll improvise it .PERIOD 
Wow ,COMMA a volunteer ,COMMA yay !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Nice to meet you .PERIOD 
Goldie Hawn :COLON Thank you .PERIOD Choose five ?QUESTIONMARK 
Jennifer Lin :COLON Yes ,COMMA five cards .PERIOD Any five cards .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD One .PERIOD Two .PERIOD Three .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA D and F -DASH -DASH too familiar .PERIOD 
One more .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA E for effort .PERIOD 
Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK .PERIOD C ,COMMA G ,COMMA B ,COMMA A and E .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
You're welcome .PERIOD And what about these ?QUESTIONMARK 
I won't use them .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA she chose C ,COMMA G ,COMMA B ,COMMA A ,COMMA E .PERIOD 
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA that's nice .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I'm going to have a moment to think ,COMMA and I'll try to make something out of it .PERIOD 
The next song ,COMMA or the encore ,COMMA that I'm going to play is called Bumble Boogie ,COMMA by Jack Fina .PERIOD 
If you go on the TED website ,COMMA you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos ,COMMA over <NUM> million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings .PERIOD 
And it got me wondering :COLON If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis ,COMMA could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk ?QUESTIONMARK 
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?QUESTIONMARK 
And also ,COMMA could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with ?QUESTIONMARK 
To find this out ,COMMA I looked at three things :COLON I looked at the topic that you should choose ,COMMA I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA with the topic :COLON There's a whole range of topics you can choose ,COMMA but you should choose wisely ,COMMA because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA to make this more concrete ,COMMA let's look at the list of top <NUM> words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks .PERIOD 
So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains ,COMMA that's a go .PERIOD 
Whereas ,COMMA if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen ,COMMA girls ,COMMA aircraft -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA I would like to hear that talk ,COMMA but statistics say it's not so good .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA well .PERIOD 
If you generalize this ,COMMA the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with ,COMMA both easily and deeply ,COMMA such as happiness ,COMMA our own body ,COMMA food ,COMMA emotions .PERIOD 
How should you deliver your talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock ,COMMA so they're going to hate me for revealing this ,COMMA because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA you should talk as long as they will let you .PERIOD 
Because the most favorite TEDTalks are ,COMMA on average ,COMMA over <NUM> percent longer than the least favorite ones .PERIOD 
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful ,COMMA inspiring or funny .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA you should be brief .PERIOD But other than that ,COMMA talk until they drag you off the stage .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA while .. .PERIOD 
While you're pushing the clock ,COMMA there's a few rules to obey .PERIOD 
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks .PERIOD 
I'll give you three examples .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA I must ,COMMA as a speaker ,COMMA provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you ,COMMA instead of saying what I can't have .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA it's okay for the speaker -DASH -DASH that's the good news -DASH -DASH to fake intellectual capacity .PERIOD 
If I don't understand something ,COMMA I can just say ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
You'll all stay with me .PERIOD 
It's perfectly fine .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's go to the visuals .PERIOD 
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .PERIOD 
And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers ,COMMA you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average ,COMMA make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker .PERIOD 
Slides are okay ,COMMA though you might consider going for props .PERIOD 
And now the most important thing ,COMMA that is the mood onstage .PERIOD 
Color plays a very important role .PERIOD 
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color ,COMMA much more than the average TEDTalk .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA personally ,COMMA I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis ,COMMA but I'll leave this to your good judgment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk .PERIOD 
And the TEDPad is a matrix of <NUM> specifically selected ,COMMA highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk .PERIOD 
You only have to make one decision ,COMMA and that is :COLON Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks ,COMMA about creativity ,COMMA human genius ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or are you going to go with a black version ,COMMA which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks ,COMMA mostly about blogs ,COMMA politics and stuff ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA download it and have fun with it .PERIOD 
Now I hope you enjoy the session .PERIOD 
I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks .PERIOD 
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this ,COMMA which I really want to see .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
Someone once said that politics is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA showbiz for ugly people .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA on that basis ,COMMA I feel like I've really arrived .PERIOD 
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is ,COMMA as a politician ,COMMA to give a TED talk ,COMMA particularly here in the U.K. ,COMMA where the reputation of politics ,COMMA with the expenses scandal ,COMMA has sunk so low .PERIOD 
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians .PERIOD 
And someone asked ,COMMA Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
and they said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA there's no shortage of politicians ,COMMA no one really minds what happens to them and ,COMMA after all ,COMMA there are some things that rats just won't do .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I know you all love data ,COMMA so I'm starting with a data-rich slide .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics ,COMMA and that is :COLON We have run out of money .PERIOD 
We have vast budget deficits .PERIOD 
This is my global public debt clock ,COMMA and ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA it's <NUM> trillion and counting .PERIOD 
And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition ,COMMA that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other ,COMMA and it's this one :COLON How do we make things better without spending more money ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services ,COMMA or to improve government ,COMMA or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about .PERIOD 
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money -DASH -DASH you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money ,COMMA you can only measure progress by spending money -DASH -DASH you're going to have a pretty miserable time .PERIOD 
But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -DASH -DASH things like your family relationships ,COMMA friendship ,COMMA community ,COMMA values -DASH -DASH then ,COMMA actually ,COMMA this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics .PERIOD 
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight ,COMMA the really straightforward argument is this :COLON That if we combine the right political philosophy ,COMMA the right political thinking ,COMMA with the incredible information revolution that has taken place ,COMMA and that all of you know so much more about than I do ,COMMA I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics ,COMMA remake government ,COMMA remake public services ,COMMA and achieve what's up on that slide ,COMMA which is a big increase in our well-being .PERIOD 
That's the argument I want to make tonight .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA starting with the political philosophy .PERIOD 
Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers .PERIOD 
Of course we don't .PERIOD 
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate .PERIOD 
The first is this :COLON We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives ,COMMA if you give people more choice ,COMMA if you put them in the driving seat ,COMMA then actually ,COMMA you can create a stronger and better society .PERIOD 
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today ,COMMA I think you can completely ,COMMA as I've said ,COMMA remake politics ,COMMA remake government ,COMMA remake your public services .PERIOD 
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature .PERIOD 
Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are ,COMMA rather than as they would like them to be .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA why do I think now is the moment to make this argument ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short ,COMMA condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history :COLON the pre-bureaucratic age ,COMMA the bureaucratic age and what we now live in ,COMMA which I think is a post-bureaucratic age .PERIOD 
A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control ,COMMA then we went to a world of central control ,COMMA and now we're in a world of people control .PERIOD 
Local power ,COMMA central power ,COMMA now ,COMMA people power .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here is King Cnut ,COMMA king a thousand years ago .PERIOD 
Thought he could turn back the waves ;SEMICOLON couldn't turn back the waves .PERIOD 
Couldn't actually turn back very much ,COMMA because if you were king a thousand years ago ,COMMA while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country ,COMMA there wasn't much you were in charge of .PERIOD 
You weren't in charge of policing ,COMMA justice ,COMMA education ,COMMA health ,COMMA welfare .PERIOD 
You could just about go to war and that was about it .PERIOD 
This was the pre-bureaucratic age ,COMMA an age in which everything had to be local .PERIOD 
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted .PERIOD 
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .PERIOD 
Next part of the cold history lesson ,COMMA the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA all sorts of transport ,COMMA travel information were possible ,COMMA and this gave birth to ,COMMA what I like to call ,COMMA the bureaucratic age .PERIOD 
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully .PERIOD There we are .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA you have the big ,COMMA strong ,COMMA central state .PERIOD 
It was able -DASH -DASH but only it was able -DASH -DASH to organize health care ,COMMA education ,COMMA policing ,COMMA justice .PERIOD 
And it was a world of ,COMMA as I say ,COMMA not local power ,COMMA but now central power .PERIOD 
It had sucked all that power up from the localities .PERIOD 
It was able to do that itself .PERIOD 
The next great stage ,COMMA which all of you are so familiar with :COLON the massive information revolution .PERIOD 
Just consider this one fact :COLON One hundred years ago ,COMMA sending these <NUM> words cost <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
Right now ,COMMA here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else ,COMMA and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost ,COMMA and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything .PERIOD 
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age ,COMMA where genuine people power is possible .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what does this mean for our politics ,COMMA for our public services ,COMMA for our government ?QUESTIONMARK 
That is already happened ;SEMICOLON the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways ,COMMA but it hasn't ,COMMA in every way ,COMMA yet touched our government .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how could this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference :COLON in transparency ,COMMA in greater choice and in accountability ,COMMA in giving us that genuine people power .PERIOD 
If we take transparency ,COMMA here is one of my favorite websites ,COMMA the Missouri Accountability Portal .PERIOD 
In the old days ,COMMA only the government could hold the information ,COMMA and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it .PERIOD 
Now here ,COMMA on one website ,COMMA one state in America ,COMMA every single dollar spent by that government is searchable ,COMMA is analyzable ,COMMA is checkable .PERIOD 
Think of the huge change that means :COLON Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent .PERIOD 
Anyone thinking ,COMMA I could do that service better ,COMMA I could deliver it cheaper ,COMMA it's all available there .PERIOD 
We have only ,COMMA in government and in politics ,COMMA started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA complete transparency will make a huge difference .PERIOD 
In this country ,COMMA if we win the election ,COMMA we are going to make all government spending over <NUM> pounds transparent and available online ,COMMA searchable for anyone to see .PERIOD 
We're going to make every contract -DASH -DASH we're announcing this today -DASH -DASH available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are ,COMMA what the conditions are ,COMMA driving huge value for money ,COMMA but also huge increases ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA in well-being as well .PERIOD 
Choice .PERIOD Now you all shop online ,COMMA compare online ,COMMA do everything online ,COMMA and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education ,COMMA or health care or policing ,COMMA and you're going to see this change massively .PERIOD 
We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country ,COMMA with searchable health sites ,COMMA so you can see what operations work out properly ,COMMA what records doctors have ,COMMA the cleanliness of hospitals ,COMMA who does best at infection control -DASH -DASH all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see .PERIOD 
And the third of these big changes :COLON accountability .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is a huge change .PERIOD 
It is a crime map .PERIOD This is a crime map from Chicago .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where ,COMMA and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account ,COMMA suddenly ,COMMA we've got this vast opportunity for people power ,COMMA where we ,COMMA as citizens ,COMMA can see what crimes are being committed -DASH -DASH where ,COMMA when and by whom -DASH -DASH and we can hold the police to account .PERIOD 
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat ,COMMA but actually that's an assault ,COMMA the one in blue .PERIOD 
You can see what crime is committed where ,COMMA and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account .PERIOD 
So those three ways -DASH -DASH transparency ,COMMA accountability and choice -DASH -DASH will make a huge difference .PERIOD 
Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people ,COMMA is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we're got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do ,COMMA and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use .PERIOD 
We're working with some of these people .PERIOD 
We're being advised by some of these people ,COMMA as was said ,COMMA to try and bring all the experience to book .PERIOD 
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple ,COMMA and I love .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK It cuts fuel poverty ,COMMA it cuts their bills ,COMMA and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time .PERIOD 
How do you do it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .PERIOD 
We even had -DASH -DASH one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark .PERIOD 
I don't think they lasted very long .PERIOD 
Look at what this does .PERIOD This is a simple piece of behavioral economics .PERIOD 
The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending ,COMMA to show them what their neighbors are spending ,COMMA and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending .PERIOD 
That sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve .PERIOD 
Other examples are recycling .PERIOD 
We all know we need to recycle more .PERIOD 
How do we make it happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
All the proof from America is that actually ,COMMA if you pay people to recycle ,COMMA if you give them a carrot rather than a stick ,COMMA you can transform their behavior .PERIOD 
So what does all this add up to ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here are my two favorite U.S .PERIOD speeches of the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
You could fight for your country ,COMMA you could die for your country ,COMMA you could serve in your country's civil service ,COMMA but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now .PERIOD 
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little :COLON It does not allow for the health of our children ,COMMA the quality of their education ,COMMA or the joy of their play .PERIOD 
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages ,COMMA the intelligence of our public debate .PERIOD 
It measures neither our wit nor our courage ,COMMA neither our wisdom nor our learning ,COMMA neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country .PERIOD 
It measures everything ,COMMA in short ,COMMA except that which makes life worthwhile .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and a beautiful dream <NUM> years ago ,COMMA but now with the huge advances in information technology ,COMMA with the massive changes in behavioral economics ,COMMA with all that we know about how you advance well-being ,COMMA that if we combine those insights of giving power to people ,COMMA and using information to make that possible ,COMMA and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature ,COMMA while at the same time ,COMMA understanding why people behave in the way they do ,COMMA it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Basking sharks are awesome creatures .PERIOD They are just magnificent .PERIOD 
They grow <NUM> meters long .PERIOD 
Some say bigger .PERIOD 
They might weigh up to two tons .PERIOD 
They're the second largest fish in the world .PERIOD 
They're also harmless plankton-feeding animals .PERIOD 
And they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour and can feed on <NUM> kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive .PERIOD 
And we're very lucky in Ireland ,COMMA we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them .PERIOD 
They were also very important to coast communities going back hundreds of years ,COMMA especially the around the Claddagh ,COMMA Duff ,COMMA Connemara region where subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way off shore ,COMMA sometimes to a place called the Sunfish Bank ,COMMA which is about <NUM> miles west of Achill Island ,COMMA to kill the basking sharks .PERIOD 
This is an old woodcut from the <NUM> ,COMMA 1800s .PERIOD 
So they were very important ,COMMA and they were important for the oil out of their liver .PERIOD 
A third of the size of the basking shark is their liver ,COMMA and it's full of oil .PERIOD 
You get gallons of oil from their liver .PERIOD 
And that oil was used especially for lighting ,COMMA but also for dressing wounds and other things .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the streetlights in <NUM> of Galway ,COMMA Dublin and Waterford were linked with sunfish oil .PERIOD 
And sunfish is one of the words for basking sharks .PERIOD 
They've been around a long time ,COMMA have been very important to coast communities .PERIOD 
Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island .PERIOD 
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island .PERIOD 
And sharks used to come into the bay .PERIOD 
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland ,COMMA string it out along the other net .PERIOD 
And as the shark came round ,COMMA it would hit the net ,COMMA the net would collapse on it .PERIOD 
It would often drown and suffocate .PERIOD 
Or at times ,COMMA they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck .PERIOD 
And then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbor ,COMMA boil them up ,COMMA use the oil .PERIOD 
They used to use the flesh as well for fertilizer and also would fin the sharks .PERIOD 
This is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide -DASH -DASH it is the finning of sharks .PERIOD 
We're often all frightened of sharks thanks to Jaws .PERIOD 
Maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year .PERIOD 
There was someone recently ,COMMA wasn't there ?QUESTIONMARK Just a couple weeks ago .PERIOD 
We kill about <NUM> million sharks a year .PERIOD 
So I don't know what the balance is ,COMMA but I think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them .PERIOD 
It was a well-documented fishery ,COMMA and as you can see here ,COMMA it peaked in the 50s where they were killing <NUM> sharks a year .PERIOD 
And it declined very fast -DASH -DASH a classic boom and bust fishery ,COMMA which suggests that a stock has been depleted or there's low reproductive rates .PERIOD 
And they killed about <NUM> sharks in this period ,COMMA literally just by stringing a manila rope off the tip of Keem Bay at Achill Island .PERIOD 
Sharks were still killed up into the mid-80s ,COMMA especially after places like Dunmore East in County Waterford .PERIOD 
And about two and a half ,COMMA <NUM> sharks were killed up till '<NUM> ,COMMA many by Norwegian vessels .PERIOD 
The black ,COMMA you can't really see this ,COMMA but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels ,COMMA and the black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a whaling vessel .PERIOD 
Now I don't pretend to have any Irish ,COMMA but in Kerry they were often known as Ainmhide na seolta ,COMMA the monster with the sails .PERIOD 
And another title would be Liop an da lapa ,COMMA the unwieldy beast with two fins .PERIOD 
Liabhan mor ,COMMA suggesting a big animal .PERIOD 
Or my favorite ,COMMA Liabhan chor greine ,COMMA the great fish of the sun .PERIOD 
And that's a lovely ,COMMA evocative name .PERIOD 
On Tory Island ,COMMA which is a strange place anyway ,COMMA they were known as muldoons ,COMMA and no one seems to know why .PERIOD 
Hope there's no one from Tory here ;SEMICOLON lovely place .PERIOD 
But more commonly all around the island ,COMMA they were known as the sunfish .PERIOD 
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out .PERIOD 
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world .PERIOD 
Some people say it's not population decline .PERIOD 
It might be a change in the distribution of plankton .PERIOD 
And it's been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change ,COMMA because they're basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open .PERIOD 
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN .PERIOD 
There's also moves in Europe to try and stop catching them .PERIOD 
There's now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally .PERIOD 
They're not protected in Ireland .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever ,COMMA despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside .PERIOD 
We know very little about them .PERIOD 
I only found out last year ,COMMA at a conference on the Isle of Man ,COMMA just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly ,COMMA frequently and predictably come to the surface to bask .PERIOD 
And it's a fantastic opportunity in science to see and experience basking sharks ,COMMA and they are awesome creatures .PERIOD 
And it gives us a fantastic opportunity to actually study them ,COMMA to get access to them .PERIOD 
So what we've been doing a couple of years -DASH -DASH but last year was a big year -DASH -DASH is we started tagging sharks so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movements and things like that .PERIOD 
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active .PERIOD 
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end .PERIOD 
Go up in your boat and tag the shark .PERIOD 
And we were very effective .PERIOD 
We tagged <NUM> sharks last summer .PERIOD 
We got <NUM> in three days off Inishowen Peninsula .PERIOD 
Half the challenge is to get access ,COMMA is to be in the right place at the right time .PERIOD 
But it's a very simple and easy technique .PERIOD 
I'll show you what they look like .PERIOD 
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark .PERIOD 
One is to try and work out the gender of the shark .PERIOD 
We also deployed a couple of satellite tags ,COMMA so we did use hi-tech stuff as well .PERIOD 
These are archival tags .PERIOD 
So what they do is they store the data .PERIOD 
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite .PERIOD 
So this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun ,COMMA plus water temperature and depth .PERIOD 
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path .PERIOD 
What happens is that you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period ,COMMA in this case it was eight months ,COMMA and literally to the day the tag popped off ,COMMA drifted up ,COMMA said hello to the satellite and sent ,COMMA not all the data ,COMMA but enough data for us to use .PERIOD 
And this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water .PERIOD 
And basically it spent all its time ,COMMA the last eight months ,COMMA in Irish waters .PERIOD 
Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge .PERIOD 
And here's one that we haven't ground-truthed it yet with sea surface temperature and water depth ,COMMA but again ,COMMA the second shark kind of spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea .PERIOD 
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man all the way out to Nova Scotia in about <NUM> days .PERIOD 
That's nine and a half thousand kilometers .PERIOD We never thought that happened .PERIOD 
Another colleague in the States tagged about <NUM> sharks off Massachusetts ,COMMA and his tags didn't really work .PERIOD 
All he knows is where he tagged them and he knows where they popped off .PERIOD 
And his tags popped off in the Caribbean and even in Brazil .PERIOD 
And we thought that basking sharks were temperate animals and only lived in our latitude .PERIOD 
But in actual fact ,COMMA they're obviously crossing the Equator as well .PERIOD 
So very simple things like that ,COMMA we're trying to learn about basking sharks .PERIOD 
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are .PERIOD 
Now I'm not a geneticist ,COMMA so I'm not going to pretend to understand the genetics .PERIOD 
And that's why it's great to have collaboration .PERIOD 
Whereas I'm a field person ,COMMA I get panic attacks if I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on -DASH -DASH take me away .PERIOD 
So we can work with geneticists who understand that .PERIOD 
So when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks ,COMMA they found that the diversity was incredibly low .PERIOD 
If you look at the first line really ,COMMA you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar .PERIOD 
I think this means basically that they're all sharks and they've come from a common ancestry .PERIOD 
If you look at nucleotide diversity ,COMMA which is more genetics that are passed on through parents ,COMMA you can see that basking sharks ,COMMA if you look at the first study ,COMMA was an order of magnitude less diversity than other shark species .PERIOD 
And you see that this work was done in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Before <NUM> ,COMMA we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks .PERIOD 
We had no idea ,COMMA did they distinguish into different populations ?QUESTIONMARK 
Were there subpopulations ?QUESTIONMARK 
And of course ,COMMA that's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals .PERIOD 
So Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really .PERIOD 
So it does seem to be that basking sharks ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA have incredibly low diversity .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA if you look at whale sharks ,COMMA which is the other plankton eating large shark ,COMMA its diversity is much greater .PERIOD 
So it doesn't really make sense at all .PERIOD 
They found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world's oceans of basking sharks .PERIOD 
So even though basking sharks are found throughout the world ,COMMA you couldn't tell the difference genetically from one from the Pacific ,COMMA the Atlantic ,COMMA New Zealand ,COMMA or from Ireland ,COMMA South Africa .PERIOD 
They all basically seem the same .PERIOD 
But again ,COMMA it's kind of surprising .PERIOD You wouldn't really expect that .PERIOD 
I don't understand this .PERIOD I don't pretend to understand this .PERIOD 
And I suspect most geneticists don't understand it either ,COMMA but they produce the numbers .PERIOD 
So you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics .PERIOD 
And Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size :COLON <NUM> animals .PERIOD 
That's it .PERIOD 
<NUM> animals in the world .PERIOD 
You're thinking ,COMMA That's just ridiculous .PERIOD No way .PERIOD 
So Les did a finer study and he found out it came out about <NUM> .PERIOD 
And using different microsatellites gave the different results .PERIOD 
But even if you toss a few numbers around ,COMMA you're probably talking of an effective population of about <NUM> animals .PERIOD 
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill there in the 70s and the 50s ?QUESTIONMARK 
So what it tells us actually is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small .PERIOD 
There's only <NUM> basking shark females in the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't know .PERIOD I don't believe it .PERIOD 
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples .PERIOD 
So where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well one obvious source is dead sharks ,COMMA Dead sharks washed up .PERIOD 
We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year ,COMMA if we're kind of lucky .PERIOD 
Another source would be fisheries bycatch .PERIOD 
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets .PERIOD 
That's banned now ,COMMA and that'll be good news for the sharks .PERIOD 
This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas ,COMMA illegally ,COMMA because you're not allowed to do that under E.U .PERIOD law ,COMMA and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak .PERIOD 
They even put a recipe up on the wall ,COMMA until they were told this was illegal .PERIOD 
And they actually did get a fine for that .PERIOD 
So if you look at all those studies I showed you ,COMMA the total number of samples worldwide is <NUM> at present .PERIOD 
So it's very important work ,COMMA and they can ask some really good questions ,COMMA and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure ,COMMA but they're constrained by lack of samples .PERIOD 
Now when we were out tagging our sharks ,COMMA this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -DASH -DASH get in there fast -DASH -DASH occasionally the sharks do react .PERIOD 
And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal ,COMMA a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail ,COMMA more ,COMMA I think ,COMMA in startle to the fact that a boat came near it ,COMMA rather than the tag going in .PERIOD 
And that was fine .PERIOD We got wet .PERIOD No problem .PERIOD 
And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head ,COMMA to the pier ,COMMA I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat .PERIOD 
And I remembered -DASH -DASH I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -DASH -DASH I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind .PERIOD 
So I was thinking that must have come from the shark .PERIOD 
Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable .PERIOD 
And we would use conventional methods -DASH -DASH I have a crossbow ,COMMA you see the crossbow in my hand there ,COMMA which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well .PERIOD 
So I tried that ,COMMA I tried many techniques .PERIOD 
All it was doing was breaking my arrows because the shark skin is just so strong .PERIOD 
There was no way we were going to get a sample from that .PERIOD 
So that wasn't going to work .PERIOD 
So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA If you take what you're given in this world .. .PERIOD 
So I scraped it off .PERIOD 
And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists .PERIOD 
So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA You might try that .PERIOD 
And they sat on it for months actually .PERIOD 
It was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man .PERIOD 
But I kept emailing ,COMMA saying ,COMMA Have you had a chance to look at my slime yet ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he was like ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD Later ,COMMA later ,COMMA later .PERIOD 
Anyway he thought he'd better do it ,COMMA because I never met him before and he might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him .PERIOD 
And he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime .PERIOD 
And they amplified it and they tested it and they found ,COMMA yes ,COMMA this was actually basking shark DNA ,COMMA which was got from the slime .PERIOD 
And so he was all very excited .PERIOD 
It became known as Simon's shark slime .PERIOD 
And I thought ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I can build on this .PERIOD 
So we thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA we're going to try to get out and get some slime .PERIOD 
So having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags ,COMMA I then thought I'd invest <NUM> -DASH -DASH the price is still on it -DASH -DASH in my local hardware store in Kilrush for a mop handle and even less money on some oven cleaners .PERIOD 
And I wrapped the oven cleaner around the end of the mop handle and was desperate ,COMMA desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks .PERIOD 
Now this was into August now ,COMMA and normally sharks peak at June ,COMMA July .PERIOD 
And you rarely see them .PERIOD 
You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August .PERIOD 
So we were desperate .PERIOD 
So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks .PERIOD 
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -DASH -DASH you see ,COMMA here's a shark that's running under the boat here -DASH -DASH we managed to collect slime .PERIOD 
And here it is .PERIOD 
Look at that lovely ,COMMA black shark slime .PERIOD 
I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for <NUM> years now ,COMMA and they're kind of a bit more dramatic .PERIOD 
You probably saw the humpback whale footage that we got there a month or two ago off County Wexford .PERIOD 
And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind .PERIOD 
But hey ,COMMA sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come .PERIOD 
So this is possibly going to be my legacy -DASH -DASH Simon's shark slime .PERIOD 
So we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples .PERIOD 
And one thing that is kind of very useful is that we use a pole cameras -DASH -DASH this is my colleague Joanne with a pole camera -DASH -DASH where you can actually look underneath the shark .PERIOD 
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark .PERIOD 
So if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it ,COMMA we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female .PERIOD 
Because at the moment ,COMMA they actually have no way genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female ,COMMA which I found absolutely staggering ,COMMA because they don't know what primers to look for .PERIOD 
And being able to tell the gender of a shark has got very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through societies ,COMMA because it is illegal to trade any sharks .PERIOD 
And they are caught and they are on the market .PERIOD 
So as a field biologist ,COMMA you just want to get encounters with these animals .PERIOD 
You want to learn as much as you can .PERIOD 
They're often quite brief .PERIOD They're often very seasonally constrained .PERIOD 
But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines ,COMMA such as geneticists ,COMMA who can gain so much more from that .PERIOD 
So as I said ,COMMA these things are sent to you in strange ways .PERIOD Grab them while you can .PERIOD 
I'll take that as my scientific legacy .PERIOD 
Hopefully I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die .PERIOD 
But for the time being ,COMMA thank you for that .PERIOD 
And keep an eye out for sharks .PERIOD 
If you're more interested ,COMMA we have a basking shark website now just set up .PERIOD 
So thank you and thank you for listening .PERIOD 
Interestingly ,COMMA I asked this question when I was a little kid .PERIOD 
When I was a kid growing up in the South Bronx ,COMMA inner-city ghetto in New York ,COMMA I was surrounded by evil ,COMMA as all kids are who grew up in an inner city .PERIOD 
And I had friends who were really good kids ,COMMA who lived out the Dr .PERIOD Jekyll Mr .PERIOD Hyde scenario -DASH -DASH Robert Louis Stevenson .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA they took drugs ,COMMA got in trouble ,COMMA went to jail .PERIOD 
Some got killed ,COMMA and some did it without drug assistance .PERIOD 
The only question is ,COMMA what was in the juice ?QUESTIONMARK 
And more importantly ,COMMA that line between good and evil -DASH -DASH which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable ,COMMA with them on the good side ,COMMA and the others on the bad side -DASH -DASH I knew that line was movable ,COMMA and it was permeable .PERIOD 
Good people could be seduced across that line ,COMMA and under good and some rare circumstances ,COMMA bad kids could recover with help ,COMMA with reform ,COMMA with rehabilitation .PERIOD 
So I want to begin with this this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C .PERIOD Escher .PERIOD 
If you look at it and focus on the white ,COMMA what you see is a world full of angels .PERIOD 
But let's look more deeply ,COMMA and as we do ,COMMA what appears is the demons ,COMMA the devils in the world .PERIOD 
And that tells us several things .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA the world is ,COMMA was ,COMMA will always be filled with good and evil ,COMMA because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition .PERIOD 
It tells me something else .PERIOD If you remember ,COMMA God's favorite angel was Lucifer .PERIOD 
Apparently ,COMMA Lucifer means the light .PERIOD 
It also means the morning star ,COMMA in some scripture .PERIOD 
And when he did ,COMMA Michael ,COMMA the archangel ,COMMA was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels .PERIOD 
And so Lucifer descends into hell ,COMMA becomes Satan ,COMMA becomes the devil ,COMMA and the force of evil in the universe begins .PERIOD 
Paradoxically ,COMMA it was God who created hell as a place to store evil .PERIOD 
He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil ,COMMA for me ,COMMA sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good ,COMMA ordinary people into perpetrators of evil .PERIOD 
So the Lucifer effect ,COMMA although it focuses on the negatives -DASH -DASH the negatives that people can become ,COMMA not the negatives that people are -DASH -DASH leads me to a psychological definition .PERIOD Evil is the exercise of power .PERIOD 
And that's the key :COLON it's about power .PERIOD 
To intentionally harm people psychologically ,COMMA to hurt people physically ,COMMA to destroy people mortally ,COMMA or ideas ,COMMA and to commit crimes against humanity .PERIOD 
If you Google evil ,COMMA a word that should surely have withered by now ,COMMA you come up with <NUM> million hits in a third of a second .PERIOD 
A few years ago -DASH -DASH I am sure all of you were shocked ,COMMA as I was ,COMMA with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war ,COMMA Abu Ghraib in Iraq .PERIOD 
And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation .PERIOD 
I was shocked ,COMMA but I wasn't surprised ,COMMA because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study .PERIOD 
Immediately the Bush administration military said .. .PERIOD what ?QUESTIONMARK 
What all administrations say when there's a scandal .PERIOD 
Don't blame us .PERIOD It's not the system .PERIOD It's the few bad apples ,COMMA the few rogue soldiers .PERIOD 
My hypothesis is ,COMMA American soldiers are good ,COMMA usually .PERIOD 
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad .PERIOD 
But how am I going to -DASH -DASH how am I going to deal with that hypothesis ?QUESTIONMARK 
And thirdly ,COMMA I had access to all of the <NUM> pictures that these soldiers took .PERIOD 
These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature .PERIOD 
All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers .PERIOD 
Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera ,COMMA they took pictures of everything .PERIOD More than <NUM> .PERIOD 
And what I've done is I organized them into various categories .PERIOD 
But these are by United States military police ,COMMA army reservists .PERIOD 
They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all .PERIOD 
And it all happened in a single place ,COMMA Tier 1-A ,COMMA on the night shift .PERIOD 
It was the interrogation hold .PERIOD The CIA was there .PERIOD 
Interrogators from Titan Corporation ,COMMA all there ,COMMA and they're getting no information about the insurgency .PERIOD 
So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers ,COMMA military police ,COMMA to cross the line ,COMMA give them permission to break the will of the enemy ,COMMA to prepare them for interrogation ,COMMA to soften them up ,COMMA to take the gloves off .PERIOD Those are the euphemisms ,COMMA and this is how it was interpreted .PERIOD 
Let's go down to that dungeon .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA pretty horrific .PERIOD 
And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill .PERIOD 
That prisoner covered himself with shit every day ,COMMA and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink .PERIOD 
But the guards ended up calling him Shit Boy .PERIOD 
What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution ?QUESTIONMARK 
In any event ,COMMA here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld .PERIOD 
He comes down and says ,COMMA I want to know ,COMMA who is responsible ?QUESTIONMARK 
You have to reframe it and ask ,COMMA What is responsible ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because what could be the who of people ,COMMA but it could also be the what of the situation ,COMMA and obviously that's wrongheaded .PERIOD 
So how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character ,COMMA if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon ?QUESTIONMARK 
There are three ways .PERIOD The main way is -DASH -DASH it's called dispositional .PERIOD 
We look at what's inside of the person ,COMMA the bad apples .PERIOD 
This is the foundation of all of social science ,COMMA the foundation of religion ,COMMA the foundation of war .PERIOD 
Social psychologists like me come along and say ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA people are the actors on the stage ,COMMA but you'll have to be aware of what that situation is .PERIOD 
Who are the cast of characters ?QUESTIONMARK What's the costume ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is there a stage director ?QUESTIONMARK 
The power is in the system .PERIOD 
The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals ,COMMA and the system is the legal ,COMMA political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA cultural background .PERIOD 
And this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers .PERIOD 
So if you want to change a person ,COMMA you've got to change the situation .PERIOD 
If you want to change the situation ,COMMA you've got to know where the power is ,COMMA in the system .PERIOD 
So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors .PERIOD 
And it's a dynamic interplay .PERIOD 
What do the people bring into the situation ?QUESTIONMARK 
What does the situation bring out of them ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation ?QUESTIONMARK 
So my book ,COMMA The Lucifer Effect ,COMMA recently published ,COMMA is about ,COMMA how do you understand how good people turn evil ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today .PERIOD 
So Dr .PERIOD Z's Lucifer Effect ,COMMA although it focuses on evil ,COMMA really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel ,COMMA caring or indifferent ,COMMA creative or destructive ,COMMA and it makes some of us villains .PERIOD 
And the good news story that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes .PERIOD 
This is a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker ,COMMA which really summarizes my whole talk :COLON I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop ,COMMA Jerome .PERIOD 
Like yourself ,COMMA I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not ,COMMA depending on the circumstances .PERIOD 
There's a study some of you think you know about ,COMMA but very few people have ever read the story .PERIOD You watched the movie .PERIOD 
People say ,COMMA No ,COMMA that's Nazi Germany ,COMMA that's Hitler ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's <NUM> .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA but suppose Hitler asked you ,COMMA 'Would you electrocute a stranger ?QUESTIONMARK ' 'No way ,COMMA not me ,COMMA I'm a good person.' He said ,COMMA Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so what he did was he tested <NUM> ordinary people .PERIOD 
<NUM> New Haven ,COMMA Connecticut ,COMMA <NUM> Bridgeport .PERIOD 
And the ad said ,COMMA Psychologists want to understand memory .PERIOD 
We want to improve people's memory ,COMMA because memory is the key to success .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're going to give you five bucks -DASH -DASH four dollars for your time .PERIOD 
And it said ,COMMA We don't want college students .PERIOD 
We want men between <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
In the later studies ,COMMA they ran women .PERIOD 
Ordinary people :COLON barbers ,COMMA clerks ,COMMA white-collar people .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you go down ,COMMA and one of you is going to be a learner ,COMMA and one of you is going to be a teacher .PERIOD 
The learner's a genial ,COMMA middle-aged guy .PERIOD 
The learner could be middle-aged ,COMMA could be as young as <NUM> .PERIOD 
And one of you is told by the authority ,COMMA the guy in the lab coat ,COMMA Your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn .PERIOD 
Gets it right ,COMMA reward him .PERIOD 
Gets it wrong ,COMMA you press a button on the shock box .PERIOD 
The first button is <NUM> volts .PERIOD He doesn't even feel it .PERIOD 
That's the key .PERIOD All evil starts with <NUM> volts .PERIOD 
And then the next step is another <NUM> volts .PERIOD 
The problem is ,COMMA at the end of the line ,COMMA it's <NUM> volts .PERIOD 
And as you go along ,COMMA the guy is screaming ,COMMA I've got a heart condition !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm out of here !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
You're a good person .PERIOD You complain .PERIOD 
Sir ,COMMA who's going to be responsible if something happens to him ?QUESTIONMARK 
The experimenter says ,COMMA Don't worry ,COMMA I will be responsible .PERIOD 
Continue ,COMMA teacher .PERIOD 
And the question is ,COMMA who would go all the way to <NUM> volts ?QUESTIONMARK 
You should notice here ,COMMA when it gets up to <NUM> ,COMMA it says ,COMMA Danger .PERIOD Severe Shock .PERIOD 
When it gets up to here ,COMMA there's XXX -DASH -DASH the pornography of power .PERIOD 
So Milgram asks <NUM> psychiatrists ,COMMA What percent of American citizens would go to the end ?QUESTIONMARK 
They said only one percent .PERIOD Because that's sadistic behavior ,COMMA and we know ,COMMA psychiatry knows ,COMMA only one percent of Americans are sadistic .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD Here's the data .PERIOD They could not be more wrong .PERIOD 
Two thirds go all the way to <NUM> volts .PERIOD This was just one study .PERIOD 
Milgram did more than <NUM> studies .PERIOD And look at this .PERIOD 
In study <NUM> ,COMMA where you see somebody like you go all the way ,COMMA <NUM> percent go all the way .PERIOD In study five ,COMMA if you see people rebel ,COMMA <NUM> percent rebel .PERIOD 
What about women ?QUESTIONMARK Study <NUM> -DASH -DASH no different than men .PERIOD 
So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority ,COMMA to go all the way to <NUM> volts .PERIOD 
And it's like a dial on human nature .PERIOD 
A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient ,COMMA down to the majority ,COMMA down to none .PERIOD 
So what are the external parallels ?QUESTIONMARK For all research is artificial .PERIOD 
What's the validity in the real world ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in <NUM> ,COMMA because they were blindly obedient to this guy ,COMMA their pastor -DASH -DASH not their priest -DASH -DASH their pastor ,COMMA Reverend Jim Jones .PERIOD 
He persuaded them to commit mass suicide .PERIOD 
Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people .PERIOD 
Most of the time ,COMMA we are in institutions ,COMMA so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .PERIOD 
Interestingly ,COMMA Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
So this study ,COMMA which I did with my graduate students ,COMMA especially Craig Haney -DASH -DASH we also began work with an ad .PERIOD 
We didn't have money ,COMMA so we had a cheap ,COMMA little ad ,COMMA but we wanted college students for a study of prison life .PERIOD 
<NUM> people volunteered ,COMMA took personality tests .PERIOD 
We did interviews .PERIOD Picked two dozen :COLON the most normal ,COMMA the most healthy .PERIOD 
Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard .PERIOD 
So on day one ,COMMA we knew we had good apples .PERIOD 
I'm going to put them in a bad situation .PERIOD 
And secondly ,COMMA we know there's no difference between the boys who are going to be guards and the boys who are going to be prisoners .PERIOD 
The kids who were going to be prisoners ,COMMA we said ,COMMA Wait at home in the dormitories .PERIOD The study will begin Sunday .PERIOD 
We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests .PERIOD 
Student :COLON A police car pulls up in front ,COMMA and a cop comes to the front door ,COMMA and knocks ,COMMA and says he's looking for me .PERIOD 
So they ,COMMA right there ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they took me out the door ,COMMA they put my hands against the car .PERIOD 
And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around .PERIOD 
They put me in the car ,COMMA then they drove me around Palo Alto .PERIOD 
They took me to the police station ,COMMA the basement of the police station .PERIOD Then they put me in a cell .PERIOD 
I was the first one to be picked up ,COMMA so they put me in a cell ,COMMA which was just like a room with a door with bars on it .PERIOD 
You could tell it wasn't a real jail .PERIOD 
They locked me in there ,COMMA in this degrading little outfit .PERIOD 
They were taking this experiment too seriously .PERIOD 
Philip Zimbardo :COLON Here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized .PERIOD 
They're going to become numbers .PERIOD 
Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .PERIOD 
Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands ,COMMA to do other humiliating tasks .PERIOD 
They strip them naked .PERIOD They sexually taunt them .PERIOD 
They begin to do degrading activities ,COMMA like having them simulate sodomy .PERIOD 
You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib .PERIOD 
My guards did it in five days .PERIOD The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
The study ended after six days ,COMMA because it was out of control .PERIOD 
Five kids had emotional breakdowns .PERIOD 
Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does it make a difference if they're anonymous ,COMMA in how they treat their victims ?QUESTIONMARK 
We know in some cultures ,COMMA they go to war ,COMMA they don't change their appearance .PERIOD 
In other cultures ,COMMA they paint themselves like Lord of the Flies .PERIOD 
In some ,COMMA they wear masks .PERIOD 
In many ,COMMA soldiers are anonymous in uniform .PERIOD 
So this anthropologist ,COMMA John Watson ,COMMA found <NUM> cultures that had two bits of data .PERIOD 
Do they change their appearance ?QUESTIONMARK <NUM> .PERIOD 
If they don't change their appearance ,COMMA only one of eight kills ,COMMA tortures or mutilates .PERIOD 
The key is in the red zone .PERIOD 
If they change their appearance ,COMMA <NUM> of <NUM> -DASH -DASH that's <NUM> percent -DASH -DASH kill ,COMMA torture ,COMMA mutilate .PERIOD 
And that's the power of anonymity .PERIOD 
So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mindlessly taking the first small step .PERIOD 
Dehumanization of others .PERIOD De-individuation of Self .PERIOD 
Diffusion of personal responsibility .PERIOD Blind obedience to authority .PERIOD 
Uncritical conformity to group norms .PERIOD 
Passive tolerance to evil through inaction or indifference .PERIOD 
And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation .PERIOD 
Your habitual response patterns don't work .PERIOD 
Your personality and morality are disengaged .PERIOD 
Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer ;SEMICOLON nothing more difficult than understanding him ,COMMA Dostoyevksy tells us .PERIOD 
Understanding is not excusing .PERIOD Psychology is not excuse-iology .PERIOD 
So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary ,COMMA good people can be transformed without the drugs .PERIOD 
You don't need it .PERIOD You just need the social-psychological processes .PERIOD 
Real world parallels ?QUESTIONMARK Compare this with this .PERIOD 
James Schlesinger -DASH -DASH and I'm going to have to end with this -DASH -DASH says ,COMMA Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances .PERIOD 
That's the Lucifer effect .PERIOD 
And he goes on to say ,COMMA The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations .PERIOD 
So another report ,COMMA an investigative report by General Fay ,COMMA says the system is guilty .PERIOD And in this report ,COMMA he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib ,COMMA by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse ,COMMA and the fact that it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time .PERIOD 
Those abuses went on for three months .PERIOD Who was watching the store ?QUESTIONMARK 
He gave the guards permission to do those things ,COMMA and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon .PERIOD 
So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas .PERIOD 
The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual .PERIOD 
The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease .PERIOD 
Bullying is a disease .PERIOD Prejudice is a disease .PERIOD Violence is a disease .PERIOD 
And since the Inquisition ,COMMA we've been dealing with problems at the individual level .PERIOD And you know what ?QUESTIONMARK It doesn't work .PERIOD 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says ,COMMA The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being .PERIOD 
That means that line is not out there .PERIOD 
That's a decision that you have to make .PERIOD That's a personal thing .PERIOD 
So I want to end very quickly on a positive note .PERIOD 
Heroism as the antidote to evil ,COMMA by promoting the heroic imagination ,COMMA especially in our kids ,COMMA in our educational system .PERIOD 
We want kids to think ,COMMA I'm the hero in waiting ,COMMA waiting for the right situation to come along ,COMMA and I will act heroically .PERIOD 
My whole life is now going to focus away from evil -DASH -DASH that I've been in since I was a kid -DASH -DASH to understanding heroes .PERIOD 
It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's Banality of Evil .PERIOD 
Our traditional societal heroes are wrong ,COMMA because they are the exceptions .PERIOD 
They organize their whole life around this .PERIOD 
That's why we know their names .PERIOD 
And our kids' heroes are also role models for them ,COMMA because they have supernatural talents .PERIOD 
We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people ,COMMA and the heroic act is unusual .PERIOD This is Joe Darby .PERIOD 
He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw ,COMMA because when he saw those images ,COMMA he turned them over to a senior investigating officer .PERIOD 
They had to put him in hiding ,COMMA because people wanted to kill him ,COMMA and then his mother and his wife .PERIOD 
For three years ,COMMA they were in hiding .PERIOD 
This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study .PERIOD 
When I said it got out of control ,COMMA I was the prison superintendent .PERIOD 
I didn't know it was out of control .PERIOD I was totally indifferent .PERIOD 
They're not prisoners ,COMMA they're not guards ,COMMA they're boys ,COMMA and you are responsible .PERIOD 
And I ended the study the next day .PERIOD 
The good news is I married her the next year .PERIOD 
I just came to my senses ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD 
So situations have the power to do ,COMMA through -DASH -DASH but the point is ,COMMA this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us ,COMMA that makes us perpetrators of evil ,COMMA can inspire the heroic imagination in others .PERIOD It's the same situation .PERIOD 
And you're on one side or the other .PERIOD 
Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction ,COMMA because your mother said ,COMMA Don't get involved .PERIOD Mind your own business .PERIOD 
And you have to say ,COMMA Mama ,COMMA humanity is my business .PERIOD 
To be a hero ,COMMA you have to learn to be a deviant ,COMMA because you're always going against the conformity of the group .PERIOD 
Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary .PERIOD Who act .PERIOD 
The key to heroism is two things .PERIOD 
A :COLON you've got to act when other people are passive .PERIOD 
B :COLON you have to act socio-centrically ,COMMA not egocentrically .PERIOD 
And I want to end with the story that some of you know ,COMMA about Wesley Autrey ,COMMA New York subway hero .PERIOD 
Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker .PERIOD 
He's standing on a subway in New York .PERIOD 
A white guy falls on the tracks .PERIOD 
The subway train is coming .PERIOD There's <NUM> people there .PERIOD

He's got a reason not to get involved .PERIOD 
He's black ,COMMA the guy's white ,COMMA and he's got two little kids .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA he gives his kids to a stranger ,COMMA jumps on the tracks ,COMMA puts the guy between the tracks ,COMMA lies on him ,COMMA the subway goes over him .PERIOD 
The train clearance is <NUM> inches .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA I did what anyone could do ,COMMA no big deal to jump on the tracks .PERIOD 
And the moral imperative is I did what everyone should do .PERIOD 
And so one day ,COMMA you will be in a new situation .PERIOD 
Evil ,COMMA meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen .PERIOD 
You're going to cheat ,COMMA or you're going to allow bullying .PERIOD 
Path three ,COMMA you become a hero .PERIOD 
The point is ,COMMA are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes ,COMMA waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because it may only happen once in your life ,COMMA and when you pass it by ,COMMA you'll always know ,COMMA I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by .PERIOD 
So the point is thinking it and then doing it .PERIOD 
So I want to thank you .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad ,COMMA and let's focus on the positive .PERIOD 
Advocate for respect of personal dignity ,COMMA for justice and peace ,COMMA which sadly our administration has not been doing .PERIOD 
Thanks so much .PERIOD 
I'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery of conscious minds .PERIOD 
The wonder is about the fact that we all woke up this morning and we had with it the amazing return of our conscious mind .PERIOD 
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self and a complete sense of our own existence ,COMMA yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder .PERIOD 
We would have no pains ,COMMA but also no joys .PERIOD 
We would have no access to love or to the ability to create .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA Scott Fitzgerald said famously that he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for .PERIOD 
But he also forgot that without consciousness ,COMMA he would have no access to true happiness and even the possibility of transcendence .PERIOD 
This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate .PERIOD 
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience ,COMMA this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation ,COMMA has got major controversies .PERIOD 
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it ;SEMICOLON we should just leave it alone ,COMMA it's not to be solved .PERIOD 
I don't believe that ,COMMA and I think the situation is changing .PERIOD 
It would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness in our brains ,COMMA but we certainly can begin to approach the question ,COMMA and we can begin to see the shape of a solution .PERIOD 
And one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow us to go inside the human brain and be able to do ,COMMA for example ,COMMA what you're seeing right now .PERIOD 
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab ,COMMA and which show you ,COMMA in a living brain ,COMMA the reconstruction of that brain .PERIOD 
And this is a person who is alive .PERIOD 
This is not a person that is being studied at autopsy .PERIOD 
And even more -DASH -DASH and this is something that one can be really amazed about -DASH -DASH is what I'm going to show you next ,COMMA which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real connections ,COMMA real pathways .PERIOD 
So all of those colored lines correspond to bunches of axons ,COMMA the fibers that join cell bodies to synapses .PERIOD 
And I'm sorry to disappoint you ,COMMA they don't come in color .PERIOD 
But at any rate ,COMMA they are there .PERIOD 
The colors are codes for the direction ,COMMA from whether it is back to front or vice versa .PERIOD 
At any rate ,COMMA what is consciousness ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is a conscious mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we could take a very simple view and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams ,COMMA or when we go under anesthesia ,COMMA and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia .PERIOD 
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia ,COMMA or when we are in deep ,COMMA dreamless sleep ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well first of all ,COMMA it is a mind ,COMMA which is a flow of mental images .PERIOD 
And of course consider images that can be sensory patterns ,COMMA visual ,COMMA such as you're having right now in relation to the stage and me ,COMMA or auditory images ,COMMA as you are having now in relation to my words .PERIOD 
That flow of mental images is mind .PERIOD 
But there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room .PERIOD 
We are not passive exhibitors of visual or auditory or tactile images .PERIOD 
We have selves .PERIOD 
We have a Me that is automatically present in our minds right now .PERIOD 
We own our minds .PERIOD 
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us that is experiencing this -DASH -DASH not the person who is sitting next to you .PERIOD 
So in order to have a conscious mind ,COMMA you have a self within the conscious mind .PERIOD 
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it .PERIOD 
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind ,COMMA and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind .PERIOD 
So what we need to know to even address this mystery is ,COMMA number one ,COMMA how are minds are put together in the brain ,COMMA and ,COMMA number two ,COMMA how selves are constructed .PERIOD 
Now the first part ,COMMA the first problem ,COMMA is relatively easy -DASH -DASH it's not easy at all -DASH -DASH but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience .PERIOD 
And it's quite clear that ,COMMA in order to make minds ,COMMA we need to construct neural maps .PERIOD 
So imagine a grid ,COMMA like the one I'm showing you right now ,COMMA and now imagine ,COMMA within that grid ,COMMA that two-dimensional sheet ,COMMA imagine neurons .PERIOD 
And picture ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA a billboard ,COMMA a digital billboard ,COMMA where you have elements that can be either lit or not .PERIOD 
And depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting ,COMMA the digital elements ,COMMA or ,COMMA for that matter ,COMMA the neurons in the sheet ,COMMA you're going to be able to construct a map .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is a visual map that I'm showing you ,COMMA but this applies to any kind of map -DASH -DASH auditory ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in relation to sound frequencies ,COMMA or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate .PERIOD 
Now to bring home the point of how close it is -DASH -DASH the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience -DASH -DASH I'm going to tell you a personal story .PERIOD 
So if I cover my left eye -DASH -DASH I'm talking about me personally ,COMMA not all of you -DASH -DASH if I cover my left eye ,COMMA I look at the grid -DASH -DASH pretty much like the one I'm showing you .PERIOD 
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular .PERIOD 
But sometime ago ,COMMA I discovered that if I cover my left eye ,COMMA instead what I get is this .PERIOD 
I look at the grid and I see a warping at the edge of my central-left field .PERIOD 
Very odd -DASH -DASH I've analyzed this for a while .PERIOD 
But sometime ago ,COMMA through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine ,COMMA Carmen Puliafito ,COMMA who developed a laser scanner of the retina ,COMMA I found out the the following .PERIOD 
If I scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner ,COMMA what I get is the following .PERIOD 
On the right side ,COMMA my retina is perfectly symmetrical .PERIOD 
You see the going down towards the fovea where the optic nerve begins .PERIOD 
But on my left retina there is a bump ,COMMA which is marked there by the red arrow .PERIOD 
And it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below .PERIOD 
And that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image .PERIOD 
So just think of this :COLON you have a grid of neurons ,COMMA and now you have a plane mechanical change in the position of the grid ,COMMA and you get a warping of your mental experience .PERIOD 
So this is how close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina ,COMMA which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball ,COMMA or ,COMMA for that matter ,COMMA a sheet of visual cortex .PERIOD 
So from the retina you go onto visual cortex .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina .PERIOD 
And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps ,COMMA can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around ,COMMA which is the association cortex ,COMMA where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making .PERIOD 
And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory ,COMMA out of those association cortices ,COMMA and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception .PERIOD 
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is .PERIOD 
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making .PERIOD 
And those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image-making when we recall information .PERIOD 
So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images .PERIOD 
The self is really the elusive problem .PERIOD 
And I thought about a solution to this problem .PERIOD 
It's the following .PERIOD 
We generate brain maps of the body's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps .PERIOD 
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this .PERIOD 
I came to this because ,COMMA if you're going to have a reference that we know as self -DASH -DASH the Me ,COMMA the I in our own processing -DASH -DASH we need to have something that is stable ,COMMA something that does not deviate much from day to day .PERIOD 
Well it so happens that we have a singular body .PERIOD 
We have one body ,COMMA not two ,COMMA not three .PERIOD 
And so that is a beginning .PERIOD 
There is just one reference point ,COMMA which is the body .PERIOD 
But then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the body has many parts ,COMMA and things grow at different rates ,COMMA and they have different sizes and different people ;SEMICOLON however ,COMMA not so with the interior .PERIOD 
The things that have to do with what is known as our internal milieu -DASH -DASH for example ,COMMA the whole management of the chemistries within our body are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason .PERIOD 
If you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range ,COMMA you go into disease or death .PERIOD 
So we have an in-built system within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity .PERIOD 
Because if you don't have that sameness ,COMMA physiologically ,COMMA you're going to be sick or you're going to die .PERIOD 
So that's one more element for this continuity .PERIOD 
And the final thing is that there is a very tight coupling between the regulation of our body within the brain and the body itself ,COMMA unlike any other coupling .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA I'm making images of you ,COMMA but there's no physiological bond between the images I have of you as an audience and my brain .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA there is a close ,COMMA permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own body .PERIOD 
So here's how it looks .PERIOD Look at the region there .PERIOD 
And it is within that region that I'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the life-regulation devices of the body .PERIOD 
This is so specific that ,COMMA for example ,COMMA if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem ,COMMA if you damage that as a result of a stroke ,COMMA for example ,COMMA what you get is coma or vegetative state ,COMMA which is a state ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in which your mind disappears ,COMMA your consciousness disappears .PERIOD 
What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self ,COMMA you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA there can be images going on ,COMMA being formed in the cerebral cortex ,COMMA except you don't know they're there .PERIOD 
You have ,COMMA in effect ,COMMA lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .PERIOD 
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem ,COMMA nothing like that happens .PERIOD 
It is that specific .PERIOD 
So in that green component of the brain stem ,COMMA if you damage it ,COMMA and often it happens ,COMMA what you get is complete paralysis ,COMMA but your conscious mind is maintained .PERIOD 
You feel ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly .PERIOD 
This is a horrific condition .PERIOD You don't want to see it .PERIOD 
And people are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA imprisoned within their own bodies ,COMMA but they do have a mind .PERIOD 
There was a very interesting film ,COMMA one of the rare good films done about a situation like this ,COMMA by Julian Schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition .PERIOD 
So now I'm going to show you a picture .PERIOD 
I promise not to say anything about this ,COMMA except this is to frighten you .PERIOD 
It's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem ,COMMA there are ,COMMA to make it simple ,COMMA all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our interior ,COMMA different aspects of our body .PERIOD 
They are exquisitely topographic and they are exquisitely interconnected in a recursive pattern .PERIOD 
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that I believe -DASH -DASH and I could be wrong ,COMMA but I don't think I am -DASH -DASH that you generate this mapping of the body that provides the grounding for the self and that comes in the form of feelings -DASH -DASH primordial feelings ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
So what is the picture that we get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look at cerebral cortex ,COMMA look at brain stem ,COMMA look at body ,COMMA and you get the picture of the interconnectivity in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body .PERIOD 
And you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with the profusion of images that are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the contents of our minds and that we normally pay most attention to ,COMMA as we should ,COMMA because that's really the film that is rolling in our minds .PERIOD 
But look at the arrows .PERIOD 
They're not there for looks .PERIOD 
They're there because there's this very close interaction .PERIOD 
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem .PERIOD 
You cannot have a conscious mind if you don't have the interaction between the brain stem and the body .PERIOD 
Another thing that is interesting is that the brain stem that we have is shared with a variety of other species .PERIOD 
So throughout vertebrates ,COMMA the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours ,COMMA which is one of the reasons why I think those other species have conscious minds like we do .PERIOD 
Except that they're not as rich as ours ,COMMA because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do .PERIOD 
That's where the difference is .PERIOD 
And I strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex .PERIOD 
Only the wealth of our minds is ,COMMA not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer to our own existence ,COMMA and that we have any sense of person .PERIOD 
Now there are three levels of self to consider -DASH -DASH the proto ,COMMA the core and the autobiographical .PERIOD 
The first two are shared with many ,COMMA many other species ,COMMA and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .PERIOD 
It's the autobiographical self which some species have ,COMMA I think .PERIOD 
Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree .PERIOD 
And everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree .PERIOD 
But the novelty is here .PERIOD 
The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made ;SEMICOLON it's the lived past and the anticipated future .PERIOD 
And the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory ,COMMA reasoning ,COMMA imagination ,COMMA creativity and language .PERIOD 
And out of that came the instruments of culture -DASH -DASH religions ,COMMA justice ,COMMA trade ,COMMA the arts ,COMMA science ,COMMA technology .PERIOD 
And it is within that culture that we really can get -DASH -DASH and this is the novelty -DASH -DASH something that is not entirely set by our biology .PERIOD 
It is developed in the cultures .PERIOD 
And this is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA you could rightly ask ,COMMA why care about this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Three reasons .PERIOD First ,COMMA curiosity .PERIOD 
Primates are extremely curious -DASH -DASH and humans most of all .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA understanding society and culture .PERIOD 
We should look at how society and culture in this socio-cultural regulation are a work in progress .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA medicine .PERIOD 
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression ,COMMA Alzheimer's disease ,COMMA drug addiction .PERIOD 
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind or render you unconscious .PERIOD 
You have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a non-serendipitous way if you do not know how this works .PERIOD 
So that's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we're doing ,COMMA and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains .PERIOD 
Thank you for your attention .PERIOD 
So I was born on the last day of the last year of the '70s .PERIOD 
I was raised on Free to be you and me -DASH -DASH hip-hop -DASH -DASH not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD Thank you for hip-hop -DASH -DASH and Anita Hill .PERIOD 
My parents were radicals -DASH -DASH who became ,COMMA well ,COMMA grown-ups .PERIOD 
My dad facetiously says ,COMMA We wanted to save the world ,COMMA and instead we just got rich .PERIOD 
We actually just got middle class in Colorado Springs ,COMMA Colorado ,COMMA but you get the picture .PERIOD 
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy .PERIOD 
At this ripe old age of <NUM> ,COMMA I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible ,COMMA beautiful time ,COMMA and I've decided ,COMMA for me ,COMMA it's been a real journey and paradox .PERIOD 
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it .PERIOD 
Feminism was the water I grew up in .PERIOD 
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons ,COMMA I was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women .PERIOD 
You can see how this had an influence .PERIOD 
But she was not the only feminist in the house .PERIOD 
My dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son ,COMMA but not his daughter .PERIOD 
He's actually here today .PERIOD 
The trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet ,COMMA not a businessman ,COMMA but the intention was really good .PERIOD 
In any case ,COMMA I didn't readily claim the feminist label ,COMMA even though it was all around me ,COMMA because I associated it with my mom's women's groups ,COMMA her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads -DASH -DASH none of which had much cachet in the hallways of Palmer High School where I was trying to be cool at the time .PERIOD 
But I suspected there was something really important about this whole feminism thing ,COMMA so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves and picking books off and reading them -DASH -DASH never ,COMMA of course ,COMMA admitting that I was doing so .PERIOD 
I didn't actually claim the feminist label until I went to Barnard College and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time .PERIOD 
They were the co-authors of a book called Manifesta .PERIOD 
So what very profound epiphany ,COMMA you might ask ,COMMA was responsible for my feminist click moment ?QUESTIONMARK 
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them .PERIOD 
I decided ,COMMA okay ,COMMA I can claim the feminist label .PERIOD 
Now I tell you this -DASH -DASH I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself ,COMMA because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics ,COMMA that beauty ,COMMA that fun do matter .PERIOD 
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example ?QUESTIONMARK 
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's ,COMMA but it looks very different .PERIOD 
My mom says ,COMMA patriarchy .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA intersectionality .PERIOD 
So race ,COMMA class ,COMMA gender ,COMMA ability ,COMMA all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman .PERIOD 
Pay equity ?QUESTIONMARK Yes .PERIOD Absolutely a feminist issue .PERIOD 
But for me ,COMMA so is immigration .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
My mom says ,COMMA Protest march .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA Online organizing .PERIOD 
I co-edit ,COMMA along with a collective of other super-smart ,COMMA amazing women ,COMMA a site called Feministing.com .PERIOD 
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever ,COMMA and I tell you this because I think it's really important to see that there's a continuum .PERIOD 
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version of consciousness raising .PERIOD 
But we also have a straightforward political impact .PERIOD 
Feministing has been able to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart .PERIOD 
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail fired from a Big Ten school .PERIOD 
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks .PERIOD 
So we're able to pull in the next generation in a totally new way .PERIOD 
My mom says ,COMMA Gloria Steinem .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA Samhita Mukhopadhyay ,COMMA Miriam Perez ,COMMA Ann Friedman ,COMMA Jessica Valenti ,COMMA Vanessa Valenti ,COMMA and on and on and on and on .PERIOD 
We don't want one hero .PERIOD 
We don't want one icon .PERIOD 
We are thousands of women and men across this country doing online writing ,COMMA community organizing ,COMMA changing institutions from the inside out -DASH -DASH all continuing the incredible work that our mothers and grandmothers started .PERIOD 
Which brings me to the second paradox :COLON sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once .PERIOD 
Many in my generation -DASH -DASH because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education -DASH -DASH were socialized to believe that we were special little snowflakes -DASH -DASH who were going to go out and save the world .PERIOD 
These are three words many of us were raised with .PERIOD 
We walk across graduation stages ,COMMA high on our overblown expectations ,COMMA and when we float back down to earth ,COMMA we realize we don't know what the heck it means to actually save the world anyway .PERIOD 
The mainstream media often paints my generation as apathetic ,COMMA and I think it's much more accurate to say we are deeply overwhelmed .PERIOD 
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about ,COMMA to be fair -DASH -DASH an environmental crisis ,COMMA wealth disparity in this country unlike we've seen since <NUM> ,COMMA and globally ,COMMA a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity .PERIOD 
Xenophobia's on the rise .PERIOD The trafficking of women and girls .PERIOD 
I experienced this firsthand myself when I graduated from Barnard College in <NUM> .PERIOD 
I was fired up ;SEMICOLON I was ready to make a difference .PERIOD 
I went out and I worked at a non-profit ,COMMA I went to grad school ,COMMA I phone-banked ,COMMA I protested ,COMMA I volunteered ,COMMA and none of it seemed to matter .PERIOD 
And on a particularly dark night of December of <NUM> ,COMMA I sat down with my family ,COMMA and I said that I had become very disillusioned .PERIOD 
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -DASH -DASH kind of a dark fantasy -DASH -DASH of writing a letter about everything that was wrong with the world and then lighting myself on fire on the White House steps .PERIOD 
My mom took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze ,COMMA her eyes really welled with tears ,COMMA and she looked right at me and she said ,COMMA I will not stand for your desperation .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA You are smarter ,COMMA more creative and more resilient than that .PERIOD 
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well .PERIOD 
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by ,COMMA Parker Palmer ,COMMA and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed between arrogant overestimation of ourselves and a servile underestimation of ourselves .PERIOD 
I did what I know to do in desperation ,COMMA which is write .PERIOD 
I wrote the book I needed to read .PERIOD 
I wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .PERIOD 
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson ,COMMA the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists ,COMMA who's dedicating her life to environmental justice .PERIOD 
I wrote about Emily Apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do ,COMMA but quickly learned ,COMMA not only did she not like it ,COMMA but she wasn't really good at it .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA what she really wanted to do was make films .PERIOD 
So she made a film about the welfare system and had a huge impact .PERIOD 
I wrote about Maricela Guzman ,COMMA the daughter of Mexican immigrants ,COMMA who joined the military so she could afford college .PERIOD 
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp and went on to co-organize a group called the Service Women's Action Network .PERIOD 
What I learned from these people and others was that I couldn't judge them based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals .PERIOD 
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -DASH -DASH the military ,COMMA congress ,COMMA the education system ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
But what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force .PERIOD 
And at the end of the day ,COMMA what could possibly be more important than that ?QUESTIONMARK 
But how good a failure is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
This isn't to say we give up our wildest ,COMMA biggest dreams .PERIOD 
It's to say we operate on two levels .PERIOD 
On one ,COMMA we really go after changing these broken systems of which we find ourselves a part .PERIOD 
But on the other ,COMMA we root our self-esteem in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day more kind ,COMMA more just ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
So when I was a little girl ,COMMA I had a couple of very strange habits .PERIOD 
One of them was I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home ,COMMA and I would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand .PERIOD 
I was listening to her talk on the phone ,COMMA which she did a lot .PERIOD 
The activists I interviewed had nothing in common ,COMMA literally ,COMMA except for one thing ,COMMA which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences .PERIOD 
So often ,COMMA particularly at a young age ,COMMA we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life ,COMMA and sometimes they're in our own kitchens ,COMMA talking on the phone ,COMMA making us dinner ,COMMA doing all that keeps the world going around and around .PERIOD 
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory ,COMMA or certainty ,COMMA or security even .PERIOD 
It's about embracing the paradox .PERIOD 
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm .PERIOD 
And it's about loving people really well .PERIOD 
And at the end of the day ,COMMA these things make for a lifetime of challenge and reward .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
The maxim ,COMMA Know thyself has been around since the ancient Greeks .PERIOD 
Some attribute this golden world knowledge to Plato ,COMMA others to Pythagoras .PERIOD 
But the truth is it doesn't really matter which sage said it first ,COMMA because it's still sage advice ,COMMA even today .PERIOD 
It's pithy almost to the point of being meaningless ,COMMA but it rings familiar and true ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Know thyself .PERIOD 
I understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems ,COMMA or more exactly the confusions ,COMMA of consciousness .PERIOD 
I've always been fascinated with knowing the self .PERIOD 
This fascination led me to submerge myself in art ,COMMA study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist .PERIOD 
Today I combine all my passions as the CEO of InteraXon ,COMMA a thought-controlled computing company .PERIOD 
My goal ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA is to help people become more in tune with themselves .PERIOD 
I take it from this little dictum ,COMMA Know thyself .PERIOD 
If you think about it ,COMMA this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA it's self-awareness that separates Homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind .PERIOD 
Today we're often too busy tending to our iPhones and iPods to really stop and get to know ourselves .PERIOD 
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute text conversations ,COMMA emails ,COMMA relentless exchange of media channels and passwords and apps and reminders and Tweets and tags ,COMMA we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place :COLON ourselves .PERIOD 
Much of the time we're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves into the world .PERIOD 
And we can barely find the time to reflect deeply back in on our own selves .PERIOD 
We've cluttered ourselves up with all this .PERIOD 
So we go far away to the top of a mountain ,COMMA assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter ,COMMA the chaotic everyday ,COMMA and find ourselves again .PERIOD 
But on that mountain where we gain that beautiful peace of mind ,COMMA what are we really achieving ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's really only a successful escape .PERIOD 
Think of the term we use ,COMMA Retreat .PERIOD 
It means we've got to get out of here .PERIOD 
Is this how we feel about the pressures of our world ,COMMA that in order to get inside ourselves ,COMMA you have to run for the hills ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the problem with escaping your day-to-day life is that you have to come home eventually .PERIOD 
So when you think about it ,COMMA we're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there .PERIOD 
And eventually that vacation's got to come to an end .PERIOD 
So my question to you is ,COMMA can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self-awareness that we seek ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions ,COMMA Know thyself ?QUESTIONMARK 
I say the answer is yes .PERIOD 
And I'm here today to share a new way that we're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before -DASH -DASH humanizing technology and furthering that age-old quest of ours to more fully know the self .PERIOD 
It's called thought-controlled computing .PERIOD 
This is actually a brainwave sensor that's reading the electrical activity of my brain as I give this talk .PERIOD 
These brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph .PERIOD 
That blue line there is my brainwave .PERIOD 
It's the direct signal being recorded from my head ,COMMA rendered in real time .PERIOD 
The green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency ,COMMA with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here .PERIOD 
You're actually looking inside my head as I speak .PERIOD 
These graphs are compelling ,COMMA they're undulating ,COMMA but from a human's perspective ,COMMA they're actually not very useful .PERIOD 
That's why we've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA what if I could use this data to find out how relaxed I am at any moment ?QUESTIONMARK 
The shape on the right over here has become an indicator of what's going on in my head .PERIOD 
The more relaxed I am ,COMMA the more the energy's going to fall through it .PERIOD 
And the more focused my brain is ,COMMA the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy .PERIOD 
Ordinarily ,COMMA I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way .PERIOD 
As we know ,COMMA our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable .PERIOD 
We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it ,COMMA and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier .PERIOD 
This new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves .PERIOD 
We're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient ,COMMA our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever .PERIOD 
I'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit ,COMMA but first I want to take a look at how we got here .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA feel free to check in on my head at any time .PERIOD 
My team at InteraXon and I have been developing throught-controlled application for almost a decade now .PERIOD 
In the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind .PERIOD 
We were making things activate ,COMMA light up and work just by thinking .PERIOD 
We were transcending the space between the mind and the device .PERIOD 
We brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with your mind ,COMMA like thought-controlled home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair .PERIOD 
We created technology and applications that engaged people's imaginations ,COMMA and it was really exciting .PERIOD 
And then we were asked to do something really big for the Olympics .PERIOD 
We were invited to create a massive installation at the Vancouver <NUM> winter Olympics ,COMMA were used in Vancouver ,COMMA got to control the lighting on the C.N .PERIOD Tower ,COMMA the Canadian Parliament buildings and Niagara Falls from all the way across the country using their minds .PERIOD 
Over <NUM> days at the Olympics <NUM> visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the C.N .PERIOD Tower ,COMMA parliament and Niagara in real time with their minds from across the country ,COMMA <NUM> km away .PERIOD 
So controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool .PERIOD 
But we're always interested in multi-tiered levels of human interaction .PERIOD 
And so we began looking into inventing thought-controlled applications in a more complex frame than just control .PERIOD 
We realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you .PERIOD 
And it could join into the relationship with you .PERIOD 
We created the responsive room where the lights music and blinds adjusted to your state .PERIOD 
They followed these little shifts in your mental activity .PERIOD 
So as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day ,COMMA on the couch in our office ,COMMA the music would mellow with you .PERIOD 
When you read ,COMMA the desk lamp would get brighter .PERIOD 
If you nod off ,COMMA the system would know ,COMMA dimming to darkness as you do .PERIOD 
That you could know something about yourself .PERIOD 
We could know sides of ourselves that were all but invisible and come to see things that were previously hidden .PERIOD 
Let me show you an example of what I'm talking about here .PERIOD 
Here's an application that I created for the iPad .PERIOD 
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form .PERIOD 
So you use it with your headset .PERIOD 
The headset connects wirelessly to an iPad or a smartphone .PERIOD 
In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear .PERIOD 
In the game that we created ,COMMA of course ,COMMA you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind .PERIOD 
As you focus on the wooden form ,COMMA it rotates .PERIOD 
The more you focus ,COMMA the faster the rotation .PERIOD 
This is for real .PERIOD 
This is not a fake .PERIOD 
What's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did .PERIOD 
And this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what's going on inside of ourselves .PERIOD 
I like to call this intra-active .PERIOD 
Normally we think about technology as interactive .PERIOD 
This technology is intra-active .PERIOD 
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward .PERIOD 
So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop .PERIOD 
At InteraXon ,COMMA intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates .PERIOD 
It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA thought-controlled computing can teach children with ADD how to improve their focus .PERIOD 
With ADD ,COMMA children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states .PERIOD 
So you can create applications that reward focused brain states .PERIOD 
So you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their ADD symptoms as they do it .PERIOD 
This can be as effective as Ritalin .PERIOD 
Perhaps even more importantly ,COMMA thought-controlled computing can give children with ADD insights into their own fluctuating mental states ,COMMA so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs .PERIOD 
We can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us ,COMMA what once mystified and separated us .PERIOD 
Brainwave technology can understand us ,COMMA anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs .PERIOD 
Imagine this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan .PERIOD 
Imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight .PERIOD 
It would be like plugging into your own personal Google .PERIOD 
On the subject of Google ,COMMA today you can search and tag images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them .PERIOD 
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy ,COMMA or whatever baby animals are to you ,COMMA and then you can search that database ,COMMA navigating with your feelings ,COMMA rather than the keywords that just hint at them .PERIOD 
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention ,COMMA just like this .PERIOD 
Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it .PERIOD 
As it aligns with our human behaviors ,COMMA it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA why ,COMMA creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are .PERIOD 
With humanized technology we can monitor the quality of your sleep cycles .PERIOD 
When our productivity starts to slacken ,COMMA we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play .PERIOD 
Do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self ,COMMA what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk ?QUESTIONMARK 
Imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest ,COMMA or what activities brought you joy .PERIOD 
Would you make more time for those people ?QUESTIONMARK Would you prioritize ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would you get a divorce ?QUESTIONMARK 
What thought-controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives .PERIOD 
And with this ,COMMA we can get the skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time .PERIOD 
We can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us about what's going on .PERIOD 
And from this ,COMMA we can learn how to change the plot ,COMMA the outcome and the character of our personal stories .PERIOD 
Two millennia ago ,COMMA those Greeks had some powerful insights .PERIOD 
They knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase ,COMMA when you come into contact with yourself .PERIOD 
They understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing ,COMMA evolving and growing .PERIOD 
But they understood something more fundamental -DASH -DASH the sheer joy in discovery ,COMMA the delight and fascination that we get from the world and being ourselves in it ,COMMA the richness that we get from seeing ,COMMA feeling and knowing the lives that we are .PERIOD 
My mom's an artist ,COMMA and as a child I'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush .PERIOD 
One moment it was all white space ,COMMA pure possibility .PERIOD 
The next ,COMMA it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions .PERIOD 
As I sat easel-side ,COMMA watching her transform canvas after canvas ,COMMA I learned that you could create your own world .PERIOD 
I learned that our own inner worlds -DASH -DASH our ideas ,COMMA emotions and imaginations -DASH -DASH were ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA not bound by our brains and bodies .PERIOD 
If you could think it ,COMMA if you could discover it ,COMMA you could bring it to life .PERIOD 
To me ,COMMA thought-controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush -DASH -DASH one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us .PERIOD 
I look forward to the day that I can sit beside you ,COMMA easel-side ,COMMA watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves .PERIOD 
Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you know what I wanted to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
I wanted to be a biker chick .PERIOD 
I wanted to race cars ,COMMA and I wanted to be a cowgirl ,COMMA and I wanted to be Mowgli from The Jungle Book .PERIOD 
Because they were all about being free ,COMMA the wind in your hair -DASH -DASH just to be free .PERIOD 
And on my seventeenth birthday ,COMMA my parents ,COMMA knowing how much I loved speed ,COMMA gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday .PERIOD 
Not that we could have afforded I drive ,COMMA but to give me the dream of driving .PERIOD 
And on my seventeenth birthday ,COMMA I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence ,COMMA as I always had all my life -DASH -DASH my visually impaired sister -DASH -DASH to go to see an eye specialist .PERIOD 
Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters .PERIOD 
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot -DASH -DASH God help her .PERIOD 
And on my seventeenth birthday ,COMMA after my fake eye exam ,COMMA the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA So what are you going to do to celebrate ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I took that driving lesson ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA I'm going to learn how to drive .PERIOD 
And then there was a silence -DASH -DASH one of those awful silences when you know something's wrong .PERIOD 
And he turned to my mother ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA You haven't told her yet ?QUESTIONMARK 
On my seventeenth birthday ,COMMA as Janis Ian would best say ,COMMA I learned the truth at <NUM> .PERIOD 
I am ,COMMA and have been since birth ,COMMA legally blind .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA how on earth did I get to <NUM> and not know that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA if anybody says country music isn't powerful ,COMMA let me tell you this :COLON I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song ,COMMA A Boy Named Sue .PERIOD 
I'm the eldest of three .PERIOD I was born in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And very shortly after my birth ,COMMA my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism .PERIOD 
And what the hell does that mean to you ?QUESTIONMARK 
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing ,COMMA so holy God ,COMMA woohoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I might buy some more time .PERIOD 
But more importantly ,COMMA let me tell you -DASH -DASH I'm going to come up really close here .PERIOD Don't freak out ,COMMA Pat .PERIOD 
Hey .PERIOD 
See this hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline .PERIOD 
Every man in this room ,COMMA even you ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA is George Clooney .PERIOD 
And every woman ,COMMA you are so beautiful .PERIOD 
And when I want to look beautiful ,COMMA I step three feet away from the mirror ,COMMA and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights .PERIOD 
The really strange part is that ,COMMA at three and a half ,COMMA just before I was going to school ,COMMA my parents made a bizarre ,COMMA unusual and incredibly brave decision .PERIOD 
No special needs schools .PERIOD 
No labels .PERIOD 
No limitations .PERIOD 
My ability and my potential .PERIOD 
And they decided to tell me that I could see .PERIOD 
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue ,COMMA a boy given a girl's name ,COMMA I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive ,COMMA when they were no longer there to protect me ,COMMA or just take it all away .PERIOD 
But more significantly ,COMMA they gave me the ability to believe ,COMMA totally ,COMMA to believe that I could .PERIOD 
And don't get me wrong ,COMMA because when I first heard it -DASH -DASH aside from the fact that I thought he was insane -DASH -DASH I got that thump in my chest ,COMMA just that huh ?QUESTIONMARK 
But very quickly I recovered .PERIOD It was like that .PERIOD 
And I swear to God ,COMMA I walked out of his office ,COMMA I will drive .PERIOD I will drive .PERIOD 
You're mad .PERIOD I'll drive .PERIOD I know I can drive .PERIOD 
And with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child -DASH -DASH he taught me how to sail ,COMMA knowing I could never see where I was going ,COMMA I could never see the shore ,COMMA and I couldn't see the sails ,COMMA and I couldn't see the destination .PERIOD 
But he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .PERIOD 
And for the next <NUM> years ,COMMA I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see ,COMMA because I didn't want to be a failure ,COMMA and I didn't want to be weak .PERIOD 
And I believed I could do it .PERIOD 
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do .PERIOD 
And I was an archeologist ,COMMA and then I broke things .PERIOD 
And then I managed a restaurant ,COMMA and then I slipped on things .PERIOD 
And then I was a masseuse .PERIOD And then I was a landscape gardener .PERIOD 
And then I went to business school .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA disabled people are hugely educated .PERIOD 
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture .PERIOD 
And they didn't even know .PERIOD 
And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA two and a half years into that job ,COMMA something happened .PERIOD 
Wonderfully ,COMMA my eyes decided ,COMMA enough .PERIOD 
And temporarily ,COMMA very unexpectedly ,COMMA they dropped .PERIOD 
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world ,COMMA where you work hard ,COMMA play hard ,COMMA you gotta be the best ,COMMA you gotta be the best .PERIOD 
And two years in ,COMMA I really could see very little .PERIOD 
And I found myself in front of an HR manager in <NUM> ,COMMA saying something I never imagined that I would say .PERIOD 
I was <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do .PERIOD 
And I simply said ,COMMA I'm sorry .PERIOD 
I can't see ,COMMA and I need help .PERIOD 
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult .PERIOD 
And you all know what it is .PERIOD You don't need to have a disability to know that .PERIOD 
We all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure .PERIOD 
And it's frightening ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
But all that belief had fueled me so long .PERIOD 
And can I tell you ,COMMA operating in the sighted world when you can't see ,COMMA it's kind of difficult -DASH -DASH it really is .PERIOD 
Can I tell you ,COMMA airports are a disaster .PERIOD 
And please ,COMMA any designers out there ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA designers ,COMMA please put up your hands ,COMMA even though I can't even see you .PERIOD 
I always end up in the gents' toilets .PERIOD 
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell .PERIOD 
But can I just tell you ,COMMA the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle .PERIOD 
Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's such a small thing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you're not ,COMMA or to be somebody that you aren't ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR ,COMMA they sent me off to an eye specialist .PERIOD 
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life .PERIOD 
But before I got to him ,COMMA I was so lost .PERIOD 
I had no idea who I was anymore .PERIOD 
And that eye specialist ,COMMA he didn't bother testing my eyes .PERIOD 
God no ,COMMA it was therapy .PERIOD 
And he asked me several questions ,COMMA of which many were ,COMMA Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?QUESTIONMARK 
And do you love what you do ,COMMA Caroline ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you know ,COMMA when you go to a global consulting firm ,COMMA they put a chip in your head ,COMMA and you're like ,COMMA I love Accenture .PERIOD I love Accenture .PERIOD I love my job .PERIOD I love Accenture .PERIOD 
I love Accenture .PERIOD I love Accenture .PERIOD I love my job .PERIOD I love Accenture .PERIOD 
To leave would be failure .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Do you love it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up .PERIOD 
Now listen ,COMMA I wasn't going to say to him ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I wanted to race cars and motorbikes .PERIOD 
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time .PERIOD 
He thought I was mad enough anyway .PERIOD 
And as I left his office ,COMMA he called me back and he said ,COMMA I think it's time .PERIOD 
I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different .PERIOD 
And that door closed .PERIOD 
And that silence just outside a doctor's office ,COMMA that many of us know .PERIOD 
And my chest ached .PERIOD 
And I had no idea where I was going .PERIOD I had no idea .PERIOD 
But I did know the game was up .PERIOD 
And I went home ,COMMA and ,COMMA because the pain in my chest ached so much ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA I'll go out for a run .PERIOD 
Really not a very sensible thing to do .PERIOD 
And I went on a run that I know so well .PERIOD 
I always run it perfectly fine .PERIOD 
And there was a rock that I always missed .PERIOD 
And I'd never fallen on it ,COMMA never .PERIOD 
And there I was crying away ,COMMA and smash ,COMMA bash on my rock .PERIOD 
Broken ,COMMA fallen over on this rock in the middle of March in <NUM> ,COMMA typical Irish weather on a Wednesday -DASH -DASH gray ,COMMA snot ,COMMA tears everywhere ,COMMA ridiculously self-pitying .PERIOD 
And I was floored ,COMMA and I was broken ,COMMA and I was angry .PERIOD 
And I didn't know what to do .PERIOD 
And I sat there for quite some time going ,COMMA How am I going to get off this rock and go home ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because who am I going to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
What am I going to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I thought about my dad ,COMMA and I thought ,COMMA Good God ,COMMA I'm so not Sue now .PERIOD 
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind ,COMMA what had happened ?QUESTIONMARK Where did it go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK Why didn't I understand ?QUESTIONMARK 
I had lost my belief .PERIOD 
Look where my belief had brought me to .PERIOD 
And now I had lost it .PERIOD And now I really couldn't see .PERIOD 
I was crumpled .PERIOD 
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me ,COMMA What do you want to be ?QUESTIONMARK What do you want to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
What did you want to be when you were little ?QUESTIONMARK Do you love what you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do something different .PERIOD What do you want to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do something different .PERIOD What do you want to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
And really slowly ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA it happened .PERIOD 
And it did happen this way .PERIOD 
And then the minute it came ,COMMA it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart -DASH -DASH something different .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book' ?QUESTIONMARK 
You don't get more different than that .PERIOD 
And the moment ,COMMA and I mean the moment ,COMMA the moment that hit me ,COMMA I swear to God ,COMMA it was like woo hoo !EXCLAMATIONMARK You know -DASH -DASH something to believe in .PERIOD 
But you can't tell me ,COMMA no ,COMMA I can't be Mowgli ,COMMA because guess what ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nobody's ever done it before ,COMMA so I'm going to go do it .PERIOD 
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl ,COMMA I'm just going to scoot .PERIOD 
And so I got off that rock ,COMMA and ,COMMA oh my God ,COMMA did I run home .PERIOD 
And I sprinted home ,COMMA and I didn't fall ,COMMA and I didn't crash .PERIOD 
And I ran up the stairs ,COMMA and there was one of my favorite books of all time ,COMMA Travels on My Elephant by Mark Shand -DASH -DASH I don't know if any of you know it .PERIOD 
And I grabbed this book off ,COMMA and I'm sitting on the couch going ,COMMA I know what I'm going to do .PERIOD 
I know how to be Mowgli .PERIOD 
I'm going to be an elephant handler .PERIOD 
And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler .PERIOD 
From global management consultant to elephant handler .PERIOD 
I had no idea how .PERIOD I had no idea how you hire an elephant ,COMMA get an elephant .PERIOD 
I didn't speak Hindi .PERIOD I'd never been to India .PERIOD Hadn't a clue .PERIOD 
But I knew I would .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA when you make a decision at the right time and the right place ,COMMA God ,COMMA that universe makes it happen for you .PERIOD 
Nine months later ,COMMA after that day on snot rock ,COMMA I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi .PERIOD 
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers across India .PERIOD 
The most powerful thing of all ,COMMA it's not that I didn't achieve before then .PERIOD Oh my God ,COMMA I did .PERIOD 
But you know ,COMMA I was believing in the wrong thing .PERIOD 
Because I wasn't believing in me ,COMMA really me ,COMMA all the bits of me -DASH -DASH all the bits of all of us .PERIOD 
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you know what ,COMMA when you really believe in yourself and everything about you ,COMMA it's extraordinary what happens .PERIOD 
And you know what ,COMMA that trip ,COMMA that thousand kilometers ,COMMA it raised enough money for <NUM> cataract eye operations .PERIOD 
Six thousand people got to see because of that .PERIOD 
When I came home off that elephant ,COMMA do you know what the most amazing part was ?QUESTIONMARK 
I chucked in my job at Accenture .PERIOD 
I left ,COMMA and I became a social entrepreneur ,COMMA and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family ,COMMA which deals with Asian elephant conservation .PERIOD 
And I set up Kanchi ,COMMA because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant ,COMMA because disability is like the elephant in the room .PERIOD 
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way -DASH -DASH no charity ,COMMA no pity .PERIOD 
But I wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .PERIOD 
It was extraordinary .PERIOD 
That's what I wanted to do .PERIOD 
It just seemed that it was possible .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA the oddest part is ,COMMA when I was on my way traveling here to TED ,COMMA I'll be honest ,COMMA I was petrified .PERIOD 
And I speak ,COMMA but this is an amazing audience ,COMMA and what am I doing here ?QUESTIONMARK 
But as I was traveling here ,COMMA you'll be very happy to know ,COMMA I did use my white symbol stick cane ,COMMA because it's really good to skip queues in the airport .PERIOD 
And I got my way here being happily proud that I couldn't see .PERIOD 
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine ,COMMA he texted me on the way over ,COMMA knowing I was scared .PERIOD 
Even though I present confident ,COMMA I was scared .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Be you .PERIOD 
And so here I am .PERIOD 
This is me ,COMMA all of me .PERIOD 
And I have learned ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA cars and motorbikes and elephants ,COMMA that's not freedom .PERIOD 
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .PERIOD 
And I never needed eyes to see -DASH -DASH never .PERIOD 
I simply needed vision and belief .PERIOD 
And if you truly believe -DASH -DASH and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart -DASH -DASH you can make change happen .PERIOD 
And we need to make it happen ,COMMA because every single one of us -DASH -DASH woman ,COMMA man ,COMMA gay ,COMMA straight ,COMMA disabled ,COMMA perfect ,COMMA normal ,COMMA whatever -DASH -DASH everyone of us must be the very best of ourselves .PERIOD 
I no longer want anybody to be invisible .PERIOD 
We all have to be included .PERIOD 
And stop with the labels ,COMMA the limiting .PERIOD 
Losing of labels ,COMMA because we are not jam jars .PERIOD 
We are extraordinary ,COMMA different ,COMMA wonderful people .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible .PERIOD 
We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this .PERIOD 
And mostly ,COMMA I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA this doesn't help .PERIOD 
Nobody's having a better day down here because of that .PERIOD 
There are a lot of ways you can describe this .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA I like to call it the national automobile slum .PERIOD 
You can call it suburban sprawl .PERIOD 
I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world .PERIOD 
You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck .PERIOD 
And it's a tremendous problem for us .PERIOD 
The outstanding -DASH -DASH the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about .PERIOD 
We're going to talk about that some more .PERIOD 
A sense of place :COLON your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings ,COMMA and to employ the vocabularies ,COMMA grammars ,COMMA syntaxes ,COMMA rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are .PERIOD 
The public realm in America has two roles :COLON it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life ,COMMA and it is the physical manifestation of the common good .PERIOD 
And when you degrade the public realm ,COMMA you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there .PERIOD 
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the <NUM> ,COMMA 000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures .PERIOD 
And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design .PERIOD 
This is a body of knowledge ,COMMA method ,COMMA skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore ;SEMICOLON we're not going to use it .PERIOD 
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically ,COMMA but it has to inform us where we are in our culture .PERIOD 
Where we've come from ,COMMA what kind of people we are ,COMMA and it needs to ,COMMA by doing that ,COMMA it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present .PERIOD 
And if there is one tremendous -DASH -DASH if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built ,COMMA the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present .PERIOD 
The environments we are living in ,COMMA more typically ,COMMA are like these .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town .PERIOD 
And remember ,COMMA to create a place of character and quality ,COMMA you have to be able to define space .PERIOD 
So how is that being accomplished here ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here ,COMMA you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth .PERIOD 
That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space .PERIOD 
Consequently ,COMMA these will be places that nobody wants to be in .PERIOD 
These will be places that are not worth caring about .PERIOD 
We have about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> places that are not worth caring about in the United States today .PERIOD 
When we have enough of them ,COMMA we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending .PERIOD 
And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq ,COMMA spilling their blood in the sand ,COMMA and ask yourself ,COMMA What is their last thought of home ?QUESTIONMARK 
We need better places in this country .PERIOD 
Public space .PERIOD This is a good public space .PERIOD 
It's a place worth caring about .PERIOD It's well defined .PERIOD 
It is emphatically an outdoor public room .PERIOD 
It has something that is terribly important -DASH -DASH it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge .PERIOD 
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops ,COMMA bars ,COMMA bistros ,COMMA destinations -DASH -DASH things go in and out of it .PERIOD It's permeable .PERIOD 
The beer goes in and out ,COMMA the waitresses go in and out ,COMMA and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA in these places in other cultures ,COMMA people just go there voluntarily because they like them .PERIOD 
We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival .PERIOD 
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there .PERIOD 
But this is how we do it in the United States .PERIOD 
Probably the most significant public space failure in America ,COMMA designed by the leading architects of the day ,COMMA Harry Cobb and I.M .PERIOD Pei :COLON Boston City Hall Plaza .PERIOD 
A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there .PERIOD 
And we can't fix it because I.M .PERIOD Pei's still alive ,COMMA and every year Harvard and M.I.T .PERIOD have a joint committee to repair it .PERIOD 
And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M .PERIOD Pei's feelings .PERIOD 
This was the winner of an international design award in ,COMMA I think ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA something like that .PERIOD 
It wasn't Pei and Cobb ,COMMA another firm designed this ,COMMA but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block .PERIOD 
This is the back of Boston City Hall ,COMMA the most important ,COMMA you know ,COMMA significant civic building in Albany -DASH -DASH excuse me -DASH -DASH in Boston .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin ,COMMA Pol Pot ,COMMA Saddam Hussein ,COMMA and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building ,COMMA because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA that it's a despotic building ;SEMICOLON it wants us to feel like termites .PERIOD 
This is it on a smaller scale :COLON the back of the civic center in my town ,COMMA Saratoga Springs ,COMMA New York .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town ,COMMA they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken ,COMMA and they shouted at me and said ,COMMA It was raining that day when you took that picture !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem .PERIOD 
Audio jack ,COMMA power supply -DASH -DASH and look ,COMMA you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA we hire firms to design these things .PERIOD 
You can see exactly what went on ,COMMA three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA eight hours before deadline ,COMMA four architects trying to get this building in on time ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings ,COMMA and the renderings ,COMMA and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table ,COMMA and -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA what was the conversation that was going on there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because you know what the last word was ,COMMA what the last sentence was of that meeting .PERIOD 
It was :COLON Fuck it .PERIOD 
That -DASH -DASH that is the message of this form of architecture .PERIOD 
The message is :COLON We don't give a fuck !EXCLAMATIONMARK We don't give a fuck .PERIOD 
So I went back on the nicest day of the year ,COMMA just to -DASH -DASH you know -DASH -DASH do some reality testing ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA he will not even go down there because it's not interesting enough for his clients ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the burglars ,COMMA the muggers .PERIOD 
It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD 
The pattern of Main Street USA -DASH -DASH in fact ,COMMA this pattern of building downtown blocks ,COMMA all over the world ,COMMA is fairly universal .PERIOD 
It's not that complicated :COLON buildings more than one story high ,COMMA built out to the sidewalk edge ,COMMA so that people who are ,COMMA you know ,COMMA all kinds of people can get into the building .PERIOD 
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs ,COMMA you know ,COMMA apartments ,COMMA offices ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor .PERIOD 
They haven't learned that in Monterey .PERIOD 
If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center ,COMMA you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner .PERIOD 
It's really incredible .PERIOD 
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk ,COMMA where the theoretical pedestrians are .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA they'll never be there ,COMMA as long as this is in that condition .PERIOD 
Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed ,COMMA we pop a handicapped ramp on that ,COMMA and then to make ourselves feel better ,COMMA we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it .PERIOD 
And that's how we do it .PERIOD 
I call them nature Band-Aids because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism ,COMMA good buildings .PERIOD 
Not just flower beds ,COMMA not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA that's not good enough .PERIOD 
We have to do good buildings .PERIOD 
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it :COLON To spatially denote the pedestrian realm ,COMMA to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway ,COMMA to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk ,COMMA and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling -DASH -DASH a vaulted ceiling -DASH -DASH over the street ,COMMA at its best .PERIOD 
And that's it .PERIOD Those are the four jobs of the street trees .PERIOD 
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods ;SEMICOLON they're not supposed to be a set for The Last of the Mohicans .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town ,COMMA between the urban and the rural .PERIOD 
They're not the same thing .PERIOD 
And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city ,COMMA which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .PERIOD 
Here you see it on a small scale -DASH -DASH the mothership has landed ,COMMA R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet .PERIOD 
A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city ,COMMA city life ,COMMA and everything connected with it .PERIOD 
And so what you see fairly early ,COMMA in the mid-19th century ,COMMA is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city ,COMMA which is going to be life in the country for everybody .PERIOD 
And believe me ,COMMA there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then ,COMMA so it really was a form of country living .PERIOD 
But what happens is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA it mutates over the next <NUM> years and it turns into something rather insidious .PERIOD 
It becomes a cartoon of a country house ,COMMA in a cartoon of the country .PERIOD 
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now .PERIOD 
And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state ,COMMA emphatically ,COMMA I'm a little cabin in the woods .PERIOD There's nothing on either side of me .PERIOD 
So you have this one last facade of the house ,COMMA the front ,COMMA which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house .PERIOD 
Because -DASH -DASH notice the porch here .PERIOD 
Unless the people that live here are Munchkins ,COMMA nobody's going to be using that .PERIOD 
This is really ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a television broadcasting a show <NUM>/<NUM> called We're Normal .PERIOD 
We're normal ,COMMA we're normal ,COMMA we're normal ,COMMA we're normal ,COMMA we're normal .PERIOD 
Please respect us ,COMMA we're normal ,COMMA we're normal ,COMMA we're normal .PERIOD 
But we know what's going on in these houses ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here ,COMMA getting ready for homeroom .PERIOD 
We know that Heather ,COMMA his sister Heather ,COMMA <NUM> years old ,COMMA is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit .PERIOD 
Because these places ,COMMA these habitats ,COMMA are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children ,COMMA and they don't have a lot of experience with medication .PERIOD 
These are not good enough for Americans .PERIOD 
These are the schools we are sending them to :COLON The Hannibal Lecter Central School ,COMMA Las Vegas ,COMMA Nevada .PERIOD 
This is a real school !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out ,COMMA that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver .PERIOD 
So every effort is made to keep them within the building .PERIOD 
Notice that nature is present .PERIOD 
We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not .PERIOD 
We are entering an epochal period of change in the world ,COMMA and -DASH -DASH certainly in America -DASH -DASH the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era .PERIOD 
It is going to change absolutely everything .PERIOD 
Chris asked me not to go on too long about this ,COMMA and I won't ,COMMA except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy .PERIOD 
Forget it .PERIOD It's not going to happen .PERIOD 
We're going to have to down-scale ,COMMA re-scale ,COMMA and re-size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it .PERIOD 
We're going to have -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH we're going to have to live closer to where we work .PERIOD 
We're going to have to live closer to each other .PERIOD 
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live .PERIOD 
The age of the <NUM> mile Caesar salad is coming to an end .PERIOD 
We're going to have to -DASH -DASH we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
We gotta do better than that !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And we should have started two days before yesterday .PERIOD 
We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there ,COMMA for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II .PERIOD 
Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns .PERIOD 
We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places ,COMMA places that are integral ,COMMA that allow -DASH -DASH that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life ,COMMA deployed in an integral fashion .PERIOD 
We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are :COLON the street ,COMMA the block ,COMMA how to compose public space that's both large and small ,COMMA the courtyard ,COMMA the civic square and how to really make use of this property .PERIOD 
We can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA in point of fact ,COMMA most of them are not going to make it .PERIOD 
They're not going to be retro-fitted ;SEMICOLON they're going to be the salvage yards of the future .PERIOD 
Some of them we're going to fix ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development .PERIOD 
And if we're lucky ,COMMA the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA our towns and cities are where they are ,COMMA and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites .PERIOD 
And most of them are still going to be there ,COMMA although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished .PERIOD 
We've got a lot of work to do .PERIOD 
We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car ;SEMICOLON we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels .PERIOD 
We are sleepwalking into the future .PERIOD 
We're not ready for what's coming at us .PERIOD 
So I urge you all to do what you can .PERIOD 
Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally .PERIOD 
Be prepared to be good neighbors .PERIOD 
Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens .PERIOD 
One final thing -DASH -DASH I've been very disturbed about this for years ,COMMA but I think it's particularly important for this audience .PERIOD 
Please ,COMMA please ,COMMA stop referring to yourselves as consumers .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
Consumers are different than citizens .PERIOD 
Consumers do not have obligations ,COMMA responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings .PERIOD 
And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion ,COMMA you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having .PERIOD 
And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face .PERIOD 
So thank you very much .PERIOD 
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending .PERIOD 
This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School .PERIOD 
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects ,COMMA and be trusted .PERIOD 
Trusted not to hurt themselves ,COMMA and trusted not to hurt others .PERIOD 
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum ,COMMA and there are no tests .PERIOD 
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .PERIOD 
When the kids arrive they're confronted with lots of stuff :COLON wood and nails and rope and wheels ,COMMA and lots of tools ,COMMA real tools .PERIOD 
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids .PERIOD 
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived ,COMMA and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .PERIOD 
Nothing ever turns out as planned .. .PERIOD ever .PERIOD 
And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -DASH -DASH and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success ,COMMA or gleeful calamity .PERIOD 
We start from doodles and sketches .PERIOD 
And sometimes we make real plans .PERIOD 
And sometimes we just start building .PERIOD 
Building is at the heart of the experience :COLON hands on ,COMMA deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand .PERIOD 
Robin and I ,COMMA acting as collaborators ,COMMA keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion .PERIOD 
Success is in the doing ,COMMA and failures are celebrated and analyzed .PERIOD 
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .PERIOD 
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities ,COMMA a really interesting behavior emerges :COLON decoration .PERIOD 
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .PERIOD 
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before .PERIOD 
Even those mundane ,COMMA hateful ,COMMA plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined .PERIOD 
And the things that they build amaze even themselves .PERIOD 
Video :COLON Three ,COMMA two ,COMMA one ,COMMA go !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Gever Tulley :COLON A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .PERIOD 
Video :COLON Yay !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Thank you .PERIOD It's been a great pleasure .PERIOD 
And so I think we can roll the video that we have .PERIOD 
[The Himalayas.] The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite :COLON unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .PERIOD 
It wasn't until we really left Earth ,COMMA got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself ,COMMA that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .PERIOD 
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
We maintain that ,COMMA put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .PERIOD 
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe ,COMMA as we see .PERIOD 
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -DASH -DASH our main space shows in the dome .PERIOD 
But what you see here is the result of ,COMMA actually ,COMMA internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden .PERIOD 
I've had <NUM> students work on this for their graduate work ,COMMA and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden .PERIOD 
This software allows interactive use ,COMMA so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live .PERIOD 
And so as we move out ,COMMA we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies ,COMMA as we see here ,COMMA light-travel time ,COMMA giving you a sense of how far away we are .PERIOD 
As we move out ,COMMA the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long ,COMMA we're essentially backing up into the past .PERIOD 
We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us -DASH -DASH the afterglow of the Big Bang .PERIOD 
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .PERIOD 
We'll fly outside it here ,COMMA just to see this sort of containment .PERIOD 
If we were outside this ,COMMA it would almost be meaningless ,COMMA in the sense as before time .PERIOD 
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .PERIOD 
Coming back quickly ,COMMA we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning ,COMMA but these are positions ,COMMA the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped ,COMMA and our sun here ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA with our own solar system .PERIOD 
What you're going to see -DASH -DASH we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -DASH -DASH these are the paths of Voyager <NUM> ,COMMA Voyager <NUM> ,COMMA Pioneer <NUM> and Pioneer <NUM> ,COMMA the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system .PERIOD 
Coming in closer ,COMMA picking up Earth ,COMMA orbit of the Moon ,COMMA and we see the Earth .PERIOD 
I know Dr .PERIOD Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I .PERIOD 
for the Cassini mission .PERIOD 
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases ,COMMA ingeniously developed so that <NUM> encounters with the largest moon ,COMMA Titan ,COMMA which is larger that the planet Mercury ,COMMA diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase .PERIOD 
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this .PERIOD 
This software can also be networked between domes .PERIOD 
And we can network between domes and classrooms .PERIOD 
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia .PERIOD 
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school .PERIOD 
This is an image from Saturday ,COMMA photographed by the Aqua satellite ,COMMA but through the Uniview software .PERIOD 
This is Nepal .PERIOD 
This is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA right here is the valley of Lhasa ,COMMA right here in Tibet .PERIOD 
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India .PERIOD 
And just in closing ,COMMA I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -DASH -DASH here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -DASH -DASH so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is .PERIOD 
Because our home is the universe ,COMMA and we are the universe ,COMMA essentially .PERIOD 
We carry that in us .PERIOD 
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all ,COMMA I think ,COMMA in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .PERIOD 
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal .PERIOD It means a lot to us .PERIOD 
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it ,COMMA but you make it yourself .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's my first idea .PERIOD And we all know about the Mozart effect -DASH -DASH the idea that's been around for the last five to <NUM> years -DASH -DASH that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero] ,COMMA that it'll raise our IQ points <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Great idea ,COMMA but it doesn't work at all .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can't just listen to music ,COMMA you have to make it somehow .PERIOD 
And I'd add to that ,COMMA that it's not just making it ,COMMA but everybody ,COMMA each of us ,COMMA everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way ,COMMA and that's one of the main parts of my work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA with the MIT Media Lab ,COMMA for quite a while now ,COMMA we've been engaged in a field called active music .PERIOD 
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience ,COMMA not just listening ,COMMA but making music ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -DASH -DASH we call these hyperinstruments -DASH -DASH for Yo-Yo Ma ,COMMA Peter Gabriel ,COMMA Prince ,COMMA orchestras ,COMMA rock bands .PERIOD Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument ,COMMA so the instrument knows how it's being played .PERIOD 
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling ,COMMA I can turn my cello into a voice ,COMMA or into a whole orchestra ,COMMA or into something that nobody has ever heard before .PERIOD 
When we started making these ,COMMA I started thinking ,COMMA why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody ,COMMA people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA we've made a whole series of instruments .PERIOD 
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera .PERIOD 
It's a whole orchestra of about <NUM> instruments ,COMMA all designed for anybody to play using natural skill .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can play a video game ,COMMA drive through a piece of music ,COMMA use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound ,COMMA touch a special surface to make melodies ,COMMA use your voice to make a whole aura .PERIOD 
And when we make the Brain Opera ,COMMA we invite the public to come in ,COMMA to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera .PERIOD 
We toured that for a long time .PERIOD It is now permanently in Vienna ,COMMA where we built a museum around it .PERIOD 
And that led to something which you probably do know .PERIOD 
Guitar Hero came out of our lab ,COMMA and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface ,COMMA people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music ,COMMA and playing it over and over and over again .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the model works ,COMMA but it's only the tip of the iceberg ,COMMA because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero .PERIOD 
And music is very fun ,COMMA but it's also transformative .PERIOD 
It's very ,COMMA very important .PERIOD 
Music can change your life ,COMMA more than almost anything .PERIOD 
It can change the way you communicate with others ,COMMA it can change your body ,COMMA it can change your mind .PERIOD So ,COMMA we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero .PERIOD 
We are very involved in education .PERIOD We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony ,COMMA where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive ,COMMA but for little kids ,COMMA so the kids will fall in love with making music ,COMMA want to spend their time doing it ,COMMA and then will demand to know how it works ,COMMA how to make more ,COMMA how to create .PERIOD So ,COMMA we make squeezy instruments ,COMMA like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers ,COMMA Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -DASH -DASH they gather your rhythm ,COMMA and like hot potato ,COMMA you send your rhythm to your friends ,COMMA who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -DASH -DASH and a software package called Hyperscore ,COMMA which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music .PERIOD Extremely easy to use ,COMMA but once you use it ,COMMA you can go quite deep -DASH -DASH music in any style .PERIOD And then ,COMMA by pressing a button ,COMMA it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces .PERIOD 
We've had good enough ,COMMA really ,COMMA very powerful effects with kids around the world ,COMMA and now people of all ages ,COMMA using Hyperscore .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context ,COMMA for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music ,COMMA mind and health .PERIOD 
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called Musicophilia .PERIOD It's on sale in the bookstore .PERIOD It's a great book .PERIOD 
If you haven't seen it ,COMMA it's worth reading .PERIOD He's a pianist himself ,COMMA and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations .PERIOD 
So we know ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to .PERIOD 
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones ,COMMA you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror ,COMMA or can't tell anyone in their family ,COMMA but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing .PERIOD And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities .PERIOD 
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes ,COMMA movement to people with Parkinson's disease .PERIOD 
It's very powerful for depression ,COMMA schizophrenia ,COMMA many ,COMMA many things .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health .PERIOD 
And we do this in many ways .PERIOD We work with many different hospitals .PERIOD 
One of them is right near Boston ,COMMA called Tewksbury Hospital .PERIOD 
It's a long-term state hospital ,COMMA where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities .PERIOD 
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital ,COMMA so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities .PERIOD 
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community .PERIOD 
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on .PERIOD 
Video :COLON They're manipulating each other's rhythms .PERIOD 
It's a real experience ,COMMA not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms ,COMMA but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group .PERIOD 
To get their hands on music ,COMMA to shape it themselves ,COMMA change it ,COMMA to experiment with it ,COMMA to make their own music .PERIOD 
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly .PERIOD 
Everybody can experience music in a profound way ,COMMA we just have to make different tools .PERIOD 
The third idea I want to share with you is that music ,COMMA paradoxically ,COMMA I think even more than words ,COMMA is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are .PERIOD I love giving talks ,COMMA although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music .PERIOD 
If I were here playing cello ,COMMA or playing on a synth ,COMMA or sharing my music with you ,COMMA I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words ,COMMA more personal things ,COMMA perhaps deeper things .PERIOD 
I think that's true for many of us ,COMMA and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have ,COMMA from ourselves to the outside world .PERIOD 
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now ,COMMA called Death and the Powers .PERIOD And it's a big opera ,COMMA one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now .PERIOD 
And it's about a man ,COMMA rich ,COMMA successful ,COMMA powerful ,COMMA who wants to live forever .PERIOD 
So this guy wants to live forever ,COMMA he downloads himself into his environment .PERIOD 
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character .PERIOD It becomes his legacy .PERIOD 
And the opera is about what we can share ,COMMA what we can pass on to others ,COMMA to the people we love ,COMMA and what we can't .PERIOD 
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument ,COMMA like this chandelier .PERIOD It takes up the whole stage .PERIOD It looks like a chandelier ,COMMA but it's actually a robotic music instrument .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as you can see in this prototype ,COMMA gigantic piano strings ,COMMA each string is controlled with a little robotic element -DASH -DASH either little bows that stroke the strings ,COMMA propellers that tickle the strings ,COMMA acoustic signals that vibrate the strings .PERIOD We also have an army of robots on stage .PERIOD 
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character ,COMMA Simon Powers ,COMMA and his family .PERIOD There are a whole series of them ,COMMA kind of like a Greek chorus .PERIOD 
They observe the action .PERIOD We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots .PERIOD These OperaBots follow my music .PERIOD 
They follow the characters .PERIOD They're smart enough ,COMMA we hope ,COMMA not to bump into each other .PERIOD They go off on their own .PERIOD 
And then they can also ,COMMA when you snap ,COMMA line up exactly the way you'd like to .PERIOD 
Even though they're cubes ,COMMA they actually have a lot of personality .PERIOD 
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System .PERIOD It's a series of books .PERIOD 
Every single book is robotic ,COMMA so they all move ,COMMA they all make sound ,COMMA and when you put them all together ,COMMA they turn into these walls ,COMMA which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers .PERIOD So he's disappeared ,COMMA but the whole physical environment becomes this person .PERIOD 
This is how he's chosen to represent himself .PERIOD 
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines .PERIOD So it's all display .PERIOD 
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System .PERIOD 
This is a sneak preview .PERIOD 
This premieres in Monaco -DASH -DASH it's in September <NUM> .PERIOD If by any chance you can't make it ,COMMA another idea with this project -DASH -DASH here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form ,COMMA through music and through the environment .PERIOD 
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces ,COMMA as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love .PERIOD 
So instead of being grand opera ,COMMA this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA if you're going to make a personal opera ,COMMA what about a personal instrument ?QUESTIONMARK 
Everything I've shown you so far -DASH -DASH whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -DASH -DASH the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person :COLON a virtuoso ,COMMA a child .PERIOD 
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave ,COMMA to the way my hands work ,COMMA to what I do very skillfully ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA to what I don't do so skillfully ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage ,COMMA so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger ,COMMA Ph.D .PERIOD student from the MIT Media Lab ,COMMA and Dan Ellsey .PERIOD Dan ,COMMA thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet ,COMMA Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury .PERIOD He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital .PERIOD 
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital ,COMMA I can tell you that ,COMMA because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA Dan ,COMMA do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?QUESTIONMARK 
Dan Ellsey :COLON Hello .PERIOD My name is Dan Ellsey .PERIOD I am <NUM> years old and I have cerebral palsy .PERIOD 
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software .PERIOD 
Tod Machover :COLON And we're really excited to have you here ,COMMA really Dan .PERIOD 
So we met Dan about three years ago ,COMMA three and a half years ago ,COMMA when we started working at Tewksbury .PERIOD Everybody we met there was fantastic ,COMMA did fantastic music .PERIOD Dan had never made music before ,COMMA and it turned out he was really fantastic at it .PERIOD He's a born composer .PERIOD 
He's very shy ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA turned out he's a fantastic composer ,COMMA and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours .PERIOD He has made many ,COMMA many pieces .PERIOD 
He makes his own CDs .PERIOD Actually ,COMMA he is quite well known in the Boston area -DASH -DASH mentors people at the hospital and children ,COMMA locally ,COMMA in how to make their own music .PERIOD 
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces ,COMMA but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you want to say a little bit about how you guys work ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance ,COMMA with precision ,COMMA with control ,COMMA and despite his physical disability ,COMMA to be able to do that ,COMMA to be able to perform his piece of music .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the process and the technology -DASH -DASH basically ,COMMA first we needed an engineering solution .PERIOD So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have a FireWire camera ,COMMA it looked at an infrared pointer .PERIOD 
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller .PERIOD 
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the design process .PERIOD We needed an input ;SEMICOLON we needed continuous tracking ;SEMICOLON in the software ,COMMA we look at the types of shapes he's making .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA then was the really interesting aspect of the work ,COMMA following the engineering part ,COMMA where ,COMMA basically ,COMMA we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how does Dan move ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's useful to him as an expressive motion ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA what's his metaphor for performance ?QUESTIONMARK 
What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music ?QUESTIONMARK 
So all the parameter fitting ,COMMA and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I think this is a perspective shift .PERIOD It's not that our technologies -DASH -DASH they provide access ,COMMA they allow us to create pieces of creative work .PERIOD 
Do they provide structure for us to do that ?QUESTIONMARK And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere .PERIOD So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA with Dan ,COMMA we needed a new design process ,COMMA a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform .PERIOD 
And so that's what we'll do today .PERIOD 
This is My Eagle Song .PERIOD 
So Dan is going to play a piece of his ,COMMA called My Eagle Song .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this is the score for Dan's piece ,COMMA completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore .PERIOD 
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore .PERIOD 
He's incredibly fast at it ,COMMA too ,COMMA faster than I am ,COMMA in fact .PERIOD 
He's really modest ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
Each one gets a color .PERIOD He goes back into the composition window ,COMMA draws the lines ,COMMA places everything the way he wants to .PERIOD Looking at the Hyperscore ,COMMA you can see it also ,COMMA you can see where the sections are ,COMMA something might continue for a while ,COMMA change ,COMMA get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end .PERIOD 
So that's the way he made his piece ,COMMA and as Adam says ,COMMA we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece .PERIOD 
It's going to be looked at by this camera ,COMMA analyze his movements ,COMMA it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to .PERIOD 
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen .PERIOD 
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring .PERIOD 
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing ,COMMA but I think it will also show you ,COMMA if you look at that movement ,COMMA that when Dan makes music ,COMMA his motions are very purposeful ,COMMA very precise ,COMMA very disciplined and they're also very beautiful .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in hearing this piece ,COMMA as I mentioned before ,COMMA the most important thing is the music's great ,COMMA and it'll show you who Dan is .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA are we ready Adam ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA now Dan will play his piece My Eagle Song for you .PERIOD 
Bravo .PERIOD 
Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school ?QUESTIONMARK 
There was this hero ,COMMA Odysseus ,COMMA who's heading back home after the Trojan War .PERIOD 
And he's standing on the deck of his ship ,COMMA he's talking to his first mate ,COMMA and he's saying ,COMMA Tomorrow ,COMMA we will sail past those rocks ,COMMA and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens .PERIOD 
Now you would expect ,COMMA given that ,COMMA that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens ,COMMA but instead Odysseus says ,COMMA I want to hear that song .PERIOD 
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men -DASH -DASH stay with me -DASH -DASH so that you can't hear the song ,COMMA and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that I can listen and we can all sail by unaffected .PERIOD 
So this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song .PERIOD 
And I'd like to think if this was the case ,COMMA they probably would have rehearsed it a few times .PERIOD 
Odysseus would have said ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA let's do a dry run .PERIOD 
You tie me to the mast ,COMMA and I'm going to beg and plead .PERIOD 
And no matter what I say ,COMMA you cannot untie me from the mast .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA so tie me to the mast .PERIOD 
And the first mate takes a rope and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot .PERIOD 
And Odysseus does his best job playacting and says ,COMMA Untie me .PERIOD Untie me .PERIOD 
And the first mate wisely resists and doesn't untie Odysseus .PERIOD 
And then Odysseus says ,COMMA I see that you can get it .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA untie me now and we'll get some dinner .PERIOD 
And the first mate hesitates .PERIOD 
He's like ,COMMA Is this still the rehearsal ,COMMA or should I untie him ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the first mate thinks ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end .PERIOD 
So he unties Odysseus ,COMMA and Odysseus flips out .PERIOD 
He's like ,COMMA You idiot .PERIOD You moron .PERIOD 
If you do that tomorrow ,COMMA I'll be dead ,COMMA you'll be dead ,COMMA every single one of the men will be dead .PERIOD 
Now just don't untie me no matter what .PERIOD 
He throws the first mate to the ground .PERIOD 
This repeats itself through the night -DASH -DASH rehearsal ,COMMA tying to the mast ,COMMA conning his way out of it ,COMMA beating the poor first mate up mercilessly .PERIOD 
Hilarity ensues .PERIOD 
Tying yourself to a mast is perhaps the oldest written example of what psychologists call a commitment device .PERIOD 
A commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you don't do something regrettable when you have a hot head .PERIOD 
Because there's two heads inside one person when you think about it .PERIOD 
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .PERIOD 
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song .PERIOD 
He just wants to get to the front row .PERIOD 
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification .PERIOD 
But then there's this other self ,COMMA the future self .PERIOD 
This is Odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife Penelope outside of Ithaca -DASH -DASH the other one .PERIOD 
So why do we need commitment devices ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people ,COMMA you probably realize it's not that your goals are physically impossible that's keeping you from achieving them ,COMMA it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them .PERIOD 
It's physically possible to lose weight .PERIOD 
It's physically possible to exercise more .PERIOD 
But resisting temptation is hard .PERIOD 
The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA let's face it ,COMMA the present self is present .PERIOD 
It's in control .PERIOD It's in power right now .PERIOD 
It has these strong ,COMMA heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .PERIOD 
And the future self is not even around .PERIOD 
It's off in the future .PERIOD It's weak .PERIOD 
It doesn't even have a lawyer present .PERIOD 
There's nobody to stick up for the future self .PERIOD 
And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams .PERIOD 
So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought ,COMMA and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two .PERIOD 
Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually .PERIOD 
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one ,COMMA but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it or unplugging your Internet connection so you can use your computer .PERIOD 
I was creating commitment devices of my own long before I knew what they were .PERIOD 
So when I was a starving post-doc at Columbia University ,COMMA I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career .PERIOD 
I had to write five pages a day towards papers or I would have to give up five dollars .PERIOD 
And when you try to execute these commitment devices ,COMMA you realize the devil is really in the details .PERIOD 
Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA you can't burn it ;SEMICOLON that's illegal .PERIOD 
And I thought ,COMMA well I could give it to a charity or give it to my wife or something like that .PERIOD 
But then I thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA I'm sending myself mixed messages .PERIOD 
Because not writing is bad ,COMMA but giving to charity is good .PERIOD 
So then I would kind of justify not writing by giving a gift .PERIOD 
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought ,COMMA well I could give it to the neo-Nazis .PERIOD 
But then I was like ,COMMA that's more bad than writing is good ,COMMA and so that wouldn't work .PERIOD 
So ultimately ,COMMA I just decided I would leave it in an envelope on the subway .PERIOD 
Sometimes a good person would find it ,COMMA sometimes a bad person would find it .PERIOD 
On average ,COMMA it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that I would regret .PERIOD 
Such it is with commitment devices .PERIOD 
But despite my like for them ,COMMA there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices ,COMMA and you might feel this if you use them yourself .PERIOD 
You're just telling yourself ,COMMA Without you ,COMMA commitment device ,COMMA I am nothing ,COMMA I have no self-discipline .PERIOD 
And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place -DASH -DASH like ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA that person's offering me a doughnut ,COMMA and I have no defense mechanism ,COMMA -DASH -DASH you just eat it .PERIOD 
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you .PERIOD 
I think self-discipline is something ,COMMA it's like a muscle .PERIOD 
The more you exercise it ,COMMA the stronger it gets .PERIOD 
You say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA of course I can't write today ,COMMA because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews ,COMMA and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that .PERIOD 
And so there's no way that this is going to work .PERIOD 
So in effect ,COMMA you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person .PERIOD 
You're putting yourself ,COMMA you're binding yourself ,COMMA and you're weaseling your way out of it ,COMMA and then you're beating yourself up afterwards .PERIOD 
So I've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA I'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self .PERIOD 
I'm talking about the topic of saving .PERIOD 
Now saving is a classic two selves problem .PERIOD 
The present self does not want to save at all .PERIOD 
It wants to consume .PERIOD 
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save .PERIOD 
So this is a timely problem .PERIOD 
We look at the savings rate and it has been declining since the 1950s .PERIOD 
At the same time ,COMMA the Retirement Risk Index ,COMMA the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement ,COMMA has been increasing .PERIOD 
So what can we do about this ?QUESTIONMARK 
There's a philosopher ,COMMA Derek Parfit ,COMMA who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I .PERIOD 
That is to say ,COMMA we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old ,COMMA or we might not be able to imagine that we're going to get old some day .PERIOD 
On the one hand ,COMMA it sounds ridiculous .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA we know that we're going to get old .PERIOD 
But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time ?QUESTIONMARK 
So my coauthors and I have used computers ,COMMA the greatest tool of our time ,COMMA to assist people's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .PERIOD 
And I'll show you some of these tools right here .PERIOD 
The first is called the distribution builder .PERIOD 
It shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future .PERIOD 
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers ,COMMA and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .PERIOD 
Being up at the top means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement .PERIOD 
Being down at the bottom means that you're struggling to make ends meet .PERIOD 
Now you can try to move your outcomes around .PERIOD 
You can try to manipulate your fate ,COMMA like this person is doing ,COMMA but it costs you something to do it .PERIOD 
It means that you have to save more today .PERIOD 
It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out .PERIOD 
At the end ,COMMA there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA this person retired at <NUM> percent of their working income in retirement .PERIOD 
They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .PERIOD 
If you're like most people ,COMMA just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -DASH -DASH just to think about making <NUM> percent more money in retirement than before .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA had you ended up on the very bottom ,COMMA it might have given you a slight sense of dread and/or nausea thinking about struggling to get by in retirement .PERIOD 
By using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome ,COMMA people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future .PERIOD 
Now people are motivated through emotions ,COMMA but different people find different things motivating .PERIOD 
This is a simulation that uses graphics ,COMMA but other people find motivating what money can buy ,COMMA not just numbers .PERIOD 
So here I made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes ,COMMA I show people what those outcomes will get you ,COMMA in particular apartments that you can afford if you're retiring on <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> dollars per month and so on .PERIOD 
As you move down the ladder of apartments ,COMMA you see that they get worse and worse .PERIOD 
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student .PERIOD 
And as you get to the very bottom ,COMMA you're faced with the unfortunate reality that if you don't save anything for retirement ,COMMA you won't be able to afford any housing at all .PERIOD 
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the Internet .PERIOD 
The last thing I'll show you ,COMMA the last behavioral time machine ,COMMA is something that I created with Hal Hershfield ,COMMA who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project ,COMMA Bill Sharpe .PERIOD 
And what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .PERIOD 
So what we do is we take pictures of people -DASH -DASH in this case ,COMMA college-age people -DASH -DASH and we use software to age them and show these people what they'll look like when they're <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
And we try to test whether actually assisting your imagination by looking at the face of your future self can change you investment behavior .PERIOD 
So this is one of our experiments .PERIOD 
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left .PERIOD 
He's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate .PERIOD 
As he moves his savings rate down ,COMMA it means that he's saving zero when it's all the way here at the left .PERIOD 
You can see his current annual income -DASH -DASH this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today -DASH -DASH is quite high ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA but his retirement income is quite low .PERIOD 
He's going to retire on <NUM> percent of what he earned while he was working .PERIOD 
If he saves the maximum legal amount ,COMMA his retirement income goes up ,COMMA but he's unhappy because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today .PERIOD 
Other conditions show people the future self .PERIOD 
And from the future self's point of view ,COMMA everything is in reverse .PERIOD 
Whereas if the present self saves a lot ,COMMA the future self is delighted ,COMMA where the income is close up near <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
To bring this to a wider audience ,COMMA I've been working with Hal and Allianz to create something we call the behavioral time machine ,COMMA in which you not only get to see yourself in the future ,COMMA but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth .PERIOD 
So for instance ,COMMA here is somebody using the tool .PERIOD 
And just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .PERIOD 
The younger face gets happier and happier ,COMMA saving nothing .PERIOD 
The older face is miserable .PERIOD 
And slowly ,COMMA slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .PERIOD 
And then it's a high savings rate .PERIOD 
The younger face is getting unhappy .PERIOD 
The older face is quite pleased with the decision .PERIOD 
We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do .PERIOD 
It's not telling you which way to put the slider ,COMMA it's just reminding you that you are connected to and legally tied to this future self .PERIOD 
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .PERIOD 
And that's something that's easy to forget .PERIOD 
This use of virtual reality is not just good for making people look older .PERIOD 
And what's good is ,COMMA unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith ,COMMA you don't have to program these by yourself in order to see the virtual reality .PERIOD 
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars that do the same thing .PERIOD 
This is actually a picture of Hal ,COMMA my coauthor .PERIOD 
You might recognize him from the previous demos .PERIOD 
And just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding ,COMMA aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .PERIOD 
And I'll close it there .PERIOD 
On behalf of Hal and myself ,COMMA I wish all the best to your present and future selves .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .PERIOD 
The bad news is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet ,COMMA so those invoices don't get issued .PERIOD 
But we need to do something about this problem .PERIOD 
A project called TEEB was started in <NUM> ,COMMA and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the G8+<NUM> .PERIOD 
And their basic inspiration was a stern review of Lord Stern .PERIOD 
They asked themselves a question :COLON If economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change ,COMMA well why can't the same be done for conservation ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why can't an equivalent case be made for nature ?QUESTIONMARK 
But it's not that straightforward .PERIOD 
It exists in many layers ,COMMA ecosystems ,COMMA species and genes across many scales -DASH -DASH international ,COMMA national ,COMMA local ,COMMA community -DASH -DASH and doing for nature what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA we began .PERIOD 
We began the project with an interim report ,COMMA which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many ,COMMA many researchers .PERIOD 
And amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA we were losing natural capital -DASH -DASH the benefits that flow from nature to us .PERIOD 
We were losing it at an extraordinary rate -DASH -DASH in fact ,COMMA of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .PERIOD 
This came out in <NUM> ,COMMA which was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars .PERIOD 
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss .PERIOD 
We then have gone on since to present for [the] international community ,COMMA for governments ,COMMA for local governments and for business and for people ,COMMA for you and me ,COMMA a whole slew of reports ,COMMA which were presented at the U.N .PERIOD last year ,COMMA which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it .PERIOD 
What is this about ?QUESTIONMARK 
A picture that you're familiar with -DASH -DASH the Amazon rainforests .PERIOD 
It's a massive store of carbon ,COMMA it's an amazing store of biodiversity ,COMMA but what people don't really know is this also is a rain factory .PERIOD 
Because the northeastern trade winds ,COMMA as they go over the Amazonas ,COMMA effectively gather the water vapor .PERIOD 
Something like <NUM> billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds ,COMMA and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the La Plata Basin .PERIOD 
This rainfall cycle ,COMMA this rainfall factory ,COMMA effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of <NUM> billion dollars-worth in Latin America .PERIOD 
But the question arises :COLON Okay ,COMMA so how much do Uruguay ,COMMA Paraguay ,COMMA Argentina and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of Amazonas ,COMMA which produces that rainfall ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the answer is zilch ,COMMA exactly zero .PERIOD 
That's the economic invisibility of nature .PERIOD 
That can't keep going on ,COMMA because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful .PERIOD 
Economics has become the currency of policy .PERIOD 
And unless we address this invisibility ,COMMA we are going to get the results that we are seeing ,COMMA which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset .PERIOD 
It's not just about the Amazonas ,COMMA or indeed about rainforests .PERIOD 
No matter what level you look at ,COMMA whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level ,COMMA we see the same problem again and again .PERIOD 
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level .PERIOD 
At the species level ,COMMA it's been estimated that insect-based pollination ,COMMA bees pollinating fruit and so on ,COMMA is something like <NUM> billion dollars-worth .PERIOD 
That's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output globally .PERIOD 
It completely passes below the radar screen .PERIOD 
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or for that matter ,COMMA if you look at the genetic level ,COMMA <NUM> percent of medicines were prospected ,COMMA were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef .PERIOD 
Once again ,COMMA most of that doesn't get paid .PERIOD 
And that brings me to another aspect of this ,COMMA which is ,COMMA to whom should this get paid ?QUESTIONMARK 
That genetic material probably belonged ,COMMA if it could belong to anyone ,COMMA to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule ,COMMA which then became the medicine .PERIOD 
They were the ones that didn't get paid .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor ,COMMA the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods ,COMMA to feed their families .PERIOD 
Something like a billion people depend on fish ,COMMA the quantity of fish in the oceans .PERIOD 
A billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA at the ecosystem level ,COMMA whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests ,COMMA or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats ,COMMA or whether it's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest ,COMMA it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services .PERIOD 
We did estimates in our study that for countries like Brazil ,COMMA India and Indonesia ,COMMA even though ecosystem services -DASH -DASH these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free -DASH -DASH they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP -DASH -DASH two ,COMMA four ,COMMA eight ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent -DASH -DASH but in these countries ,COMMA if we measure how much they're worth to the poor ,COMMA the answers are more like <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
That's the difference .PERIOD 
Because these are important benefits for the poor .PERIOD 
And you can't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset ,COMMA the most important asset ,COMMA which is your development asset ,COMMA that is ecological infrastructure .PERIOD 
How bad can things get ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance .PERIOD 
It's basically a measure of how many tigers ,COMMA toads ,COMMA ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around .PERIOD 
If you start green ,COMMA it's like <NUM> to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
If it's yellow ,COMMA it's <NUM> to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And these are percentages versus the original state ,COMMA so to speak ,COMMA the pre-industrial era ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now I'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this .PERIOD 
And just watch the change in colors in India ,COMMA China ,COMMA Europe ,COMMA sub-Saharan Africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us .PERIOD 
See that again .PERIOD 
The only places that remain green -DASH -DASH and that's not good news -DASH -DASH is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA places like the Gobi Desert ,COMMA like the tundra and like the Sahara .PERIOD 
But that doesn't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .PERIOD 
This is the challenge .PERIOD 
And here's an example from Thailand where we found that ,COMMA because the value of a mangrove is not that much -DASH -DASH it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured -DASH -DASH compared to its value as a shrimp farm ,COMMA which is more like $9 ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms .PERIOD 
But of course ,COMMA if you look at exactly what those profits are ,COMMA almost <NUM> of those dollars are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA subsidies .PERIOD 
So you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it's more like <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
That's not that hard .PERIOD 
But on the other hand ,COMMA if you start measuring ,COMMA how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use ?QUESTIONMARK 
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects ,COMMA that answer is more like $12 ,COMMA <NUM> of cost .PERIOD 
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries ,COMMA the fish nurseries ,COMMA that provide fish for the poor ,COMMA that answer is more like $11 ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
So now look at the different lens .PERIOD 
If you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits ,COMMA you get a completely different answer ,COMMA which is clearly conservation makes more sense ,COMMA and not destruction .PERIOD 
So is this just a story from South Thailand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Sorry ,COMMA this is a global story .PERIOD 
And here's what the same calculation looks like ,COMMA which was done recently -DASH -DASH well I say recently ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years -DASH -DASH by a group called TRUCOST .PERIOD 
And they calculated for the top <NUM> corporations ,COMMA what are the externalities ?QUESTIONMARK 
In other words ,COMMA what are the costs of doing business as usual ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is not illegal stuff ,COMMA this is basically business as usual ,COMMA which causes climate-changing emissions ,COMMA which have an economic cost .PERIOD 
Use of freshwater .PERIOD 
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm ,COMMA that's not illegal ,COMMA but yes ,COMMA it costs the community .PERIOD 
Can we stop this ,COMMA and how ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital .PERIOD 
Basically the stuff of life is natural capital ,COMMA and we need to recognize and build that into our systems .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA this was what really inspired my interest in this phase .PERIOD 
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project .PERIOD 
That was in the early 2000s when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth as the means forward -DASH -DASH looking at China with its stellar growths of eight ,COMMA nine ,COMMA <NUM> percent and wondering ,COMMA why can we do the same ?QUESTIONMARK 
And a few friends of mine and I decided this doesn't make sense .PERIOD 
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses .PERIOD 
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for India and its states .PERIOD 
That's how my interests began and went to the TEEB project .PERIOD 
Calculating this at the national level is one thing ,COMMA and it has begun .PERIOD 
And the World Bank has acknowledged this and they've started a project called WAVES -DASH -DASH Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services .PERIOD 
But calculating this at the next level ,COMMA that means at the business sector level ,COMMA is important .PERIOD 
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project .PERIOD 
We've done this for a very difficult case ,COMMA which was for deforestation in China .PERIOD 
This is important ,COMMA because in China in <NUM> ,COMMA the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society .PERIOD 
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded ,COMMA causing something like <NUM> deaths .PERIOD 
It was associated largely with the construction industry .PERIOD 
And the Chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling .PERIOD 
A retrospective on <NUM> years shows that if we had accounted for these costs -DASH -DASH the cost of loss of topsoil ,COMMA the cost of loss of waterways ,COMMA the lost productivity ,COMMA the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors ,COMMA desertification and so on -DASH -DASH those costs are almost twice as much as the market price of timber .PERIOD 
So in fact ,COMMA the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within China .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA after the event one can be wise .PERIOD 
The way to do this is to do it on a company basis ,COMMA to take leadership forward ,COMMA and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost ,COMMA and to disclose these answers .PERIOD 
Someone once asked me ,COMMA Who is better or worse ,COMMA is it Unilever or is it P&amp ;SEMICOLON G when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia ?QUESTIONMARK 
But if we look at companies like PUMA -DASH -DASH Jochen Zeitz ,COMMA their CEO and chairman ,COMMA once challenged me at a function ,COMMA saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it .PERIOD 
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time ,COMMA but he's done it .PERIOD 
He's basically worked the cost to PUMA .PERIOD 
PUMA has <NUM> billion dollars of turnover ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars of profits ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars after tax ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars of externalities ,COMMA cost to business .PERIOD 
Now that's not a happy situation for them ,COMMA but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say ,COMMA Here's what we are measuring .PERIOD 
We are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure .PERIOD 
Today we can't yet do that ,COMMA but I think the path is laid out .PERIOD 
This can be done .PERIOD 
And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K .PERIOD 
The other favorite ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA these are my favorites -DASH -DASH externalities calculation and green carbon markets .PERIOD 
TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it ,COMMA but these are the favorites .PERIOD 
What's green carbon ?QUESTIONMARK 
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .PERIOD 
It's about energy emissions .PERIOD 
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace .PERIOD 
It's not doing too well .PERIOD We've over-issued .PERIOD 
But that's all about energy and industry .PERIOD 
But what we're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon ,COMMA that is soot .PERIOD 
What we're also missing is blue carbon ,COMMA which ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is the largest store of carbon -DASH -DASH more than <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Thankfully ,COMMA the flux ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa ,COMMA is more or less balanced .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA what's being absorbed is something like <NUM> percent of our emissions ,COMMA which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans .PERIOD 
More of that in a minute .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA there's deforestation ,COMMA and there's emission of methane from agriculture .PERIOD 
Green carbon ,COMMA which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions ,COMMA and blue carbon together comprise <NUM> percent of our emissions .PERIOD 
We have the means already in our hands ,COMMA through a structure ,COMMA through a mechanism ,COMMA called REDD Plus -DASH -DASH a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .PERIOD 
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards Indonesia and Brazil to implement this Red Plus scheme .PERIOD 
So we actually have some movement forward .PERIOD 
But the thing is to do a lot more of that .PERIOD 
Will this solve the problem ?QUESTIONMARK Will economics solve everything ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well I'm afraid not .PERIOD 
There is an area that is the oceans ,COMMA coral reefs .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA they cut across the entire globe all the way from Micronesia across Indonesia ,COMMA Malaysia ,COMMA India ,COMMA Madagascar and to the West of the Caribbean .PERIOD 
These red dots ,COMMA these red areas ,COMMA basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .PERIOD 
So that's almost an eighth of society .PERIOD 
And the sad thing is that ,COMMA as these coral reefs are lost -DASH -DASH and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above <NUM> parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs -DASH -DASH we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species ,COMMA the warm water corals ,COMMA we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans ,COMMA but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than <NUM> million people who live in the developing world in poor countries .PERIOD 
We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .PERIOD 
Well what I will say to you in parting is that we may have done that .PERIOD 
Let's think about it and what it means ,COMMA but please ,COMMA let's not do more of that .PERIOD 
Because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital .PERIOD 
I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence .PERIOD 
And I'm going to tell you the Richard Feynman that I knew .PERIOD 
I'm sure there are other people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew ,COMMA and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman .PERIOD 
He was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA foremost ,COMMA a very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very great scientist .PERIOD 
He was an actor .PERIOD You saw him act .PERIOD 
I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures ,COMMA up in the balcony .PERIOD 
They were fantastic .PERIOD 
He was a philosopher ;SEMICOLON he was a drum player ;SEMICOLON he was a teacher par excellence .PERIOD 
Richard Feynman was also a showman ,COMMA an enormous showman .PERIOD 
He was brash ,COMMA irreverent -DASH -DASH he was full of macho ,COMMA a kind of macho one-upmanship .PERIOD 
He loved intellectual battle .PERIOD 
He had a gargantuan ego .PERIOD 
But the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .PERIOD 
And what I mean by that is a lot of room ,COMMA in my case -DASH -DASH I can't speak for anybody else -DASH -DASH but in my case ,COMMA a lot of room for another big ego .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA not as big as his ,COMMA but fairly big .PERIOD 
I always felt good with Dick Feynman .PERIOD 
It was always fun to be with him .PERIOD 
He always made me feel smart .PERIOD 
How can somebody like that make you feel smart ?QUESTIONMARK 
Somehow he did .PERIOD 
He made me feel smart .PERIOD He made me feel he was smart .PERIOD 
He made me feel we were both smart ,COMMA and the two of us could solve any problem whatever .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA we did sometimes do physics together .PERIOD 
We never published a paper together ,COMMA but we did have a lot of fun .PERIOD 
He loved to win .PERIOD 
With these little macho games we would sometimes play -DASH -DASH and he didn't only play them with me ,COMMA he played them with all sorts of people -DASH -DASH he would almost always win .PERIOD 
But when he didn't win ,COMMA when he lost ,COMMA he would laugh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won .PERIOD 
I remember once he told me a story about a joke that the students played on him .PERIOD 
They took him -DASH -DASH I think it was for his birthday -DASH -DASH they took him for lunch .PERIOD 
They took him for lunch to a sandwich place in Pasadena .PERIOD 
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing .PERIOD 
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich .PERIOD 
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich .PERIOD 
The students went there in advance ,COMMA and they arranged that they would all order Feynman sandwiches .PERIOD 
One after another ,COMMA they came in and ordered Feynman sandwiches .PERIOD 
Feynman loved this story .PERIOD 
He told me this story ,COMMA and he was really happy and laughing .PERIOD 
When he finished the story ,COMMA I said to him ,COMMA Dick ,COMMA I wonder what would be the difference between a Feynman sandwich and a Susskind sandwich .PERIOD 
And without skipping a beat at all ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA they'd be about the same .PERIOD 
The only difference is a Susskind sandwich would have a lot more ham ,COMMA ham ,COMMA as in bad actor .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I happened to have been very quick that day ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA but a lot less baloney .PERIOD 
The truth of the matter is that a Feynman sandwich had a load of ham ,COMMA but absolutely no baloney .PERIOD 
What Feynman hated worse than anything else was intellectual pretense -DASH -DASH phoniness ,COMMA false sophistication ,COMMA jargon .PERIOD 
I remember sometime during the '80s ,COMMA the mid-'80s ,COMMA Dick and I and Sidney Coleman would meet a couple of times up in San Francisco at some very rich guy's house -DASH -DASH up in San Francisco for dinner .PERIOD 
And the last time the rich guy invited us ,COMMA he also invited a couple of philosophers .PERIOD 
These guys were philosophers of mind .PERIOD 
Their specialty was the philosophy of consciousness .PERIOD 
And they were full of all kinds of jargon .PERIOD 
I'm trying to remember the words -DASH -DASH monism ,COMMA dualism ,COMMA categories all over the place .PERIOD 
I didn't know what those things meant ,COMMA neither did Dick -DASH -DASH neither did Sydney for that matter .PERIOD 
And what did we talk about ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA what do you talk about when you talk about minds ?QUESTIONMARK 
One thing ,COMMA there's one obvious thing to talk about -DASH -DASH can a machine become a mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can you build a machine that thinks like a human being ,COMMA that is conscious ?QUESTIONMARK 
We sat around and we talked about this -DASH -DASH we of course never resolved it .PERIOD 
But the trouble with the philosophers is that they were philosophizing when they should have been science-iphizing .PERIOD 
It's a scientific question after all .PERIOD 
And this was a very ,COMMA very dangerous thing to do around Dick Feynman .PERIOD 
Feynman let them have it -DASH -DASH both barrels ,COMMA right between the eyes .PERIOD 
It was brutal ;SEMICOLON it was funny -DASH -DASH ooh ,COMMA it was funny .PERIOD 
He really popped their balloon .PERIOD 
He wasn't feeling too well ,COMMA so he left a little bit early .PERIOD 
And Sidney and I were left there with the two philosophers .PERIOD 
And the amazing thing is these guys were flying .PERIOD 
They were so happy .PERIOD 
They had met the great man ;SEMICOLON they had been instructed by the great man ;SEMICOLON they had an enormous amount of fun having their faces shoved in the mud ,COMMA and it was something special .PERIOD 
I realized there was something just extraordinary about Feynman ,COMMA even when he did what he did .PERIOD 
Dick ,COMMA he was my friend .PERIOD I did call him Dick .PERIOD 
Dick and I had a certain ,COMMA a little bit of a rapport .PERIOD 
I think it may have been a special rapport that he and I had .PERIOD 
We liked each other ;SEMICOLON we liked the same kind of things .PERIOD 
I also liked the kind of intellectual macho games .PERIOD 
And Dick became convinced at some point that he and I had some kind of similarity of personality .PERIOD 
I don't think he was right .PERIOD 
I think the only point of similarity between us is we both like to talk about ourselves .PERIOD 
But he was convinced of this .PERIOD 
And he was curious .PERIOD 
The man was incredibly curious .PERIOD 
And he wanted to understand what it was and why it was that there was this funny connection .PERIOD 
And one day we were walking .PERIOD We were in France .PERIOD 
We were in La Zouche .PERIOD 
We were up in the mountains ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
We were up in the mountains ,COMMA and Feynman said to me ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Leonardo .PERIOD 
The reason he called me Leonardo is because we were in Europe and he was practicing his French .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA my real hero was my father .PERIOD 
He was a working man ,COMMA had a fifth grade education .PERIOD 
He was a master mechanic ,COMMA and he taught me how to use tools .PERIOD 
He taught me all sorts of things about mechanical things .PERIOD 
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem .PERIOD 
He didn't call it the hypotenuse ,COMMA he called it the shortcut distance .PERIOD 
And Feynman's eyes just opened up .PERIOD 
He went off like a light bulb .PERIOD 
And he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA he had been convinced at one time that ,COMMA to be a good physicist ,COMMA that it was very important to have had that kind of relationship with your father .PERIOD 
I apologize for the sexist conversation here ,COMMA but this is the way it really happened .PERIOD 
He said that he had been absolutely convinced that this was necessary -DASH -DASH the necessary part of the growing up of a young physicist .PERIOD 
He wanted to go out and do an experiment .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA well he did .PERIOD 
He went out and did an experiment .PERIOD 
He asked all his friends that he thought were good physicists ,COMMA Was it your mom or your pop that influenced you ?QUESTIONMARK 
And to a man -DASH -DASH they were all men -DASH -DASH to a man ,COMMA every single one of them said ,COMMA My mother .PERIOD 
But he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .PERIOD 
And for some time ,COMMA he was convinced this was the reason we got along so well .PERIOD 
I don't know .PERIOD Maybe .PERIOD Who knows ?QUESTIONMARK 
Feynman's style -DASH -DASH no ,COMMA style is not the right word .PERIOD 
Style makes you think of the bow tie he might have worn or the suit he was wearing .PERIOD 
There's something much deeper than that ,COMMA but I can't think of another word for it .PERIOD 
Feynman's scientific style was always to look for the simplest ,COMMA most elementary solution to a problem that was possible .PERIOD 
If it wasn't possible ,COMMA you had to use something fancier .PERIOD 
But no doubt part of this was his great joy and pleasure in showing people that he could think more simply than they could .PERIOD 
But he also deeply believed ,COMMA he truly believed ,COMMA that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it .PERIOD 
In the 1950s ,COMMA people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked .PERIOD 
There was a theory .PERIOD 
It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist ,COMMA and it was a complicated theory .PERIOD 
I'll tell you what that theory was soon enough .PERIOD 
It was a terribly complicated theory full of very difficult integrals and formulas and mathematics and so forth .PERIOD 
And it sort of worked ,COMMA but it didn't work very well .PERIOD 
The only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very ,COMMA very far apart .PERIOD 
The helium atoms had to be very far apart .PERIOD 
And unfortunately ,COMMA the helium atoms in liquid helium are right on top of each other .PERIOD 
Feynman decided ,COMMA as a sort of amateur helium physicist ,COMMA that he would try to figure it out .PERIOD 
He had an idea ,COMMA a very clear idea .PERIOD 
He would try to figure out what the quantum wave function of this huge number of atoms looked like .PERIOD 
The small number of simple principles were very ,COMMA very simple .PERIOD 
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other ,COMMA they repel .PERIOD 
The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero ,COMMA it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other .PERIOD 
The other fact is that the ground state ,COMMA the lowest energy state of a quantum system ,COMMA the wave function is always very smooth -DASH -DASH has the minimum number of wiggles .PERIOD 
So he sat down -DASH -DASH and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -DASH -DASH and he tried to write down ,COMMA and did write down ,COMMA the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between .PERIOD 
He wrote down a simple thing .PERIOD 
The thing was that that simple thing that he wrote down explained everything that was known at the time about liquid helium and then some .PERIOD 
I've always wondered whether the professionals ,COMMA the real professional helium physicists ,COMMA were just a little bit embarrassed by this .PERIOD 
They had their super-powerful technique ,COMMA and they couldn't do as well .PERIOD 
Incidentally ,COMMA I'll tell you what that super-powerful technique was .PERIOD 
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams .PERIOD 
He did it again in <NUM> .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA in my own university -DASH -DASH I wasn't there at the time -DASH -DASH but in <NUM> ,COMMA they were exploring the structure of the proton .PERIOD 
The proton is obviously made of a whole bunch of little particles .PERIOD 
This was more or less known .PERIOD 
And the way to analyze it was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA Feynman diagrams .PERIOD 
That's what Feynman diagrams were constructed for -DASH -DASH to understand particles .PERIOD 
The experiments that were going on were very simple .PERIOD 
This was the thing the Feynman diagrams were for .PERIOD 
The only problem was that Feynman diagrams are complicated .PERIOD 
They're difficult integrals .PERIOD 
If you could do all of them ,COMMA you would have a very precise theory .PERIOD 
But you couldn't ;SEMICOLON they were just too complicated .PERIOD 
People were trying to do them .PERIOD 
You could do a one loop diagram .PERIOD Don't worry about one loop .PERIOD 
One loop ,COMMA two loops -DASH -DASH maybe you could do a three loop diagram ,COMMA but beyond that ,COMMA you couldn't do anything .PERIOD 
Feynman said ,COMMA Forget all of that .PERIOD 
Just think of the proton as an assemblage of little particles -DASH -DASH a swarm of little particles .PERIOD 
He called them partons .PERIOD He called them partons .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast .PERIOD 
Because they're moving real fast ,COMMA relativity says the internal motions go very slow .PERIOD 
The electron hits it suddenly .PERIOD 
It's like taking a very sudden snapshot of the proton .PERIOD 
What do you see ?QUESTIONMARK 
You see a frozen bunch of partons .PERIOD 
They don't move ,COMMA and because they don't move during the course of the experiment ,COMMA you don't have to worry about how they're moving .PERIOD 
You don't have to worry about the forces between them .PERIOD 
You just get to think of it as a population of frozen partons .PERIOD 
This was the key to analyzing these experiments .PERIOD 
Extremely effective ,COMMA it really did -DASH -DASH somebody said the word revolution is a bad word .PERIOD 
I suppose it is ,COMMA so I won't say revolution -DASH -DASH but it certainly evolved very ,COMMA very deeply our understanding of the proton ,COMMA and of particles beyond that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I had some more that I was going to tell you about my connection with Feynman ,COMMA what he was like ,COMMA but I see I have exactly half a minute .PERIOD 
I think he would have said ,COMMA I don't need this .PERIOD 
But how should we honor Feynman ?QUESTIONMARK 
How should we really honor Feynman ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think the answer is we should honor Feynman by getting as much baloney out of our own sandwiches as we can .PERIOD 
I was asked by Wilsonart International ,COMMA a plastic laminate company ,COMMA which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -DASH -DASH they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York ,COMMA in <NUM> .PERIOD 
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design ,COMMA interiors and furniture ,COMMA we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it ,COMMA and trying to portray laminate ,COMMA and a trailer ,COMMA in kind of a fresh ,COMMA new contemporary look .PERIOD 
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .PERIOD 
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .PERIOD 
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight ,COMMA modern ,COMMA futuristic ,COMMA high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway ,COMMA and the interiors were completely out of sync with that .PERIOD 
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .PERIOD 
That seemed really like a crisis to me ,COMMA that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape ,COMMA and about travel ,COMMA and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell .PERIOD 
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer ,COMMA and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .PERIOD 
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell .PERIOD 
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing .PERIOD 
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer ,COMMA mocked it up in cardboard ,COMMA we'd come in and cut ,COMMA decide things were wrong ,COMMA pull it out ,COMMA put it back in .PERIOD 
The main goal was to smooth out the interior ,COMMA and begin to speak about motion ,COMMA and mobility ,COMMA and independence .PERIOD 
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .PERIOD 
So that became a challenge .PERIOD 
Compounding that ,COMMA the material of choice ,COMMA laminate ,COMMA that I was trying to highlight ,COMMA only bends in two dimensions .PERIOD 
It's a compound curve interior .PERIOD 
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .PERIOD 
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .PERIOD 
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space ,COMMA so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way ,COMMA and that the casework wouldn't break up the space .PERIOD 
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin ,COMMA so they function as an electrical chase .PERIOD 
That trailer led to another commission ,COMMA to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block .PERIOD 
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo ,COMMA in October .PERIOD 
Teruo Kurosaki ,COMMA who owns a furniture company called Idee ,COMMA he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo .PERIOD 
He said one he would like to make a real trailer ,COMMA functioning ,COMMA and we would sell that one .PERIOD 
Trailer number two ,COMMA you have a blank slate ,COMMA you can to anything you want .PERIOD 
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States ,COMMA that would collect records and go on tours .PERIOD 
This trailer housed two turntables ,COMMA mixer ,COMMA wet bar ,COMMA fridge ,COMMA integrated sound system .PERIOD 
It's got a huge couch ,COMMA fits quite a few people ,COMMA and basically we'd had a great time with this .PERIOD 
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel ,COMMA and escape ,COMMA in an idiosyncratic sense .PERIOD 
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream .PERIOD 
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream .PERIOD 
They came to me and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what can we do to freshen this thing up ?QUESTIONMARK 
And do you think kids ,COMMA you know ,COMMA skateboarders ,COMMA surfers ,COMMA rock climbers ,COMMA would use these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA not in that interior .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype ,COMMA and it's called the Bambi prototype .PERIOD 
And I walked in their prototype facility ,COMMA and it's exactly like my shop ,COMMA only bigger -DASH -DASH same tools ,COMMA same things .PERIOD 
So the problem became -DASH -DASH and they set this dilemma to me -DASH -DASH that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology ,COMMA and there's no money for tooling or molding .PERIOD 
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .PERIOD 
All the casework is hand-scribed in ,COMMA uniquely ,COMMA so you can't just cut <NUM> parts for <NUM> trailers ,COMMA you have to cut them big ,COMMA and every single one is hand-fit .PERIOD 
They didn't want to go to a componentized system .PERIOD 
And there it is ,COMMA that's the Bambi <NUM> .PERIOD 
I don't have children .PERIOD 
I borrow my friends' children ,COMMA so take all this advice with a grain of salt .PERIOD 
I'm Gever Tulley .PERIOD 
I'm a contract computer scientist by trade ,COMMA but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School .PERIOD 
It's a summer program which aims to help kids to learn how to build the things that they think of .PERIOD 
So we build a lot of things .PERIOD 
And I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders .PERIOD 
So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School ,COMMA they do come back bruised ,COMMA scraped and bloody .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations .PERIOD 
There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get .PERIOD 
We put suffocation warnings on all the -DASH -DASH on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States or for sale with an item in the United States .PERIOD 
And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of <NUM> .PERIOD 
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object ,COMMA every pokey bit in the world ,COMMA then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic ,COMMA they'll hurt themselves with it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller ,COMMA we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them .PERIOD 
And despite all of our best efforts and intentions ,COMMA kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can ,COMMA in whatever environment they can .PERIOD 
So despite the provocative title ,COMMA this presentation is really about safety and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative ,COMMA confident and in control of the environment around them .PERIOD 
And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress .PERIOD 
The book is called <NUM> Dangerous Things .PERIOD 
This is five dangerous things .PERIOD 
Thing number one -DASH -DASH play with fire .PERIOD 
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history .PERIOD 
Whether we remember it or not ,COMMA it's a -DASH -DASH it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things .PERIOD 
These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA playing with fire .PERIOD 
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered ,COMMA fire .PERIOD 
From playing with it ,COMMA they learn some basic principles about fire ,COMMA about intake ,COMMA about combustion ,COMMA about exhaust .PERIOD 
These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have to have a good controlled fire .PERIOD 
And you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory .PERIOD 
You don't know what they're going to learn from playing with it .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me ,COMMA they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys .PERIOD 
Number two -DASH -DASH own a pocketknife .PERIOD 
Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness ,COMMA which I think is a terrible thing .PERIOD 
Your first -DASH -DASH your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's a spatula ,COMMA it's a pry bar ,COMMA it's a screwdriver and it's a blade .PERIOD 
And it's a -DASH -DASH it's a powerful and empowering tool .PERIOD 
And in a lot of cultures they give knives -DASH -DASH like ,COMMA as soon as they're toddlers they have knives .PERIOD 
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber .PERIOD 
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was <NUM> ,COMMA and it left a lasting impression ,COMMA to see babies playing with knives .PERIOD 
And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age .PERIOD 
You lay down a couple of very simple rules -DASH -DASH always cut away from your body ,COMMA keep the blade sharp ,COMMA never force it -DASH -DASH and these are things kids can understand and practice with .PERIOD 
I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself .PERIOD 
But you know ,COMMA they're young .PERIOD They heal fast .PERIOD 
Number three -DASH -DASH throw a spear .PERIOD 
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things and ,COMMA like muscles ,COMMA if you don't use parts of your brain ,COMMA they tend to atrophy over time .PERIOD 
But when you exercise them ,COMMA any given muscle adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too .PERIOD 
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill ,COMMA so it's very good for that kind of whole-body training .PERIOD 
These kinds of target-based practice also helps kids develop attention and concentration skills .PERIOD 
So those are great .PERIOD 
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher .PERIOD 
Next time you're about to throw out an appliance ,COMMA don't throw it out .PERIOD 
Take it apart with your kid ,COMMA or send him to my school and we'll take it apart with them .PERIOD 
Even if you don't know what the parts are ,COMMA puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart ,COMMA and no matter how complex they are ,COMMA they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually ,COMMA they can understand all of them .PERIOD 
It's a sense of knowability ,COMMA that something is knowable .PERIOD 
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them .PERIOD 
Number five -DASH -DASH two-parter .PERIOD 
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .PERIOD 
There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -DASH -DASH in this case ,COMMA digital media .PERIOD 
It's a very simple exercise -DASH -DASH buy a song on ITunes ,COMMA write it to a CD ,COMMA then rip the CD to an MP3 and play it on your very same computer .PERIOD 
You've just broken a law .PERIOD 
Technically the RIAA can come and persecute you .PERIOD 
It's an important lesson for kids to understand -DASH -DASH that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted .PERIOD 
And it's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -DASH -DASH and also when we go out and drive a car .PERIOD 
Driving a car is a -DASH -DASH is a really empowering act for a young child ,COMMA so this is the ultimate .PERIOD 
For those of you who aren't comfortable actually breaking the law ,COMMA you can drive a car with your child .PERIOD 
This is -DASH -DASH this is a great stage for a kid .PERIOD 
This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs ,COMMA these big things in the outside world that they're trying to get a grip on .PERIOD 
A car is a similar object ,COMMA and they can get in a car and drive it .PERIOD 
And that's a really ,COMMA like -DASH -DASH it gives them a handle on a world in a way that they wouldn't -DASH -DASH that they don't often have access to .PERIOD 
So -DASH -DASH and it's perfectly legal .PERIOD 
Find a big empty lot ,COMMA make sure there's nothing in it and it's on private property ,COMMA and let them drive your car .PERIOD 
It's very safe actually .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's see .PERIOD 
I think that's it .PERIOD That's number five and a half .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
So let me just start with my story .PERIOD 
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college .PERIOD 
Then I went on to tear my ACL ,COMMA the ligament in my knee ,COMMA and then developed an arthritic knee .PERIOD 
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story ,COMMA and ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA I married a woman who has exactly the same story .PERIOD 
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .PERIOD 
So with that ,COMMA let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain .PERIOD 
Cancer may kill you ,COMMA but when you look at the numbers ,COMMA arthritis ruins more lives .PERIOD 
Assuming you live a long life ,COMMA there's a <NUM> percent chance you'll develop arthritis .PERIOD 
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis .PERIOD 
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain ,COMMA until our joints quite literally grind to a halt .PERIOD 
Desperate for a solution ,COMMA we've turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts ,COMMA but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body ,COMMA shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better ,COMMA more natural way ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's consider an alternative path .PERIOD 
What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature ,COMMA or within our own stem cells ?QUESTIONMARK 
Kevin Stone :COLON And so ,COMMA the mission is :COLON how do I treat these things biologically ?QUESTIONMARK 
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife ,COMMA and what I've done for hundreds of other patients .PERIOD 
First thing for my wife ,COMMA and the most common thing I hear from my patients ,COMMA particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group ,COMMA 70-year-old age group ,COMMA is they come in and say ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA Doc ,COMMA isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm not ready for joint replacement .PERIOD 
And so for her ,COMMA I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that [knee] joint space .PERIOD 
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus] .PERIOD 
And then for that unstable ligament ,COMMA we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee .PERIOD 
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface ,COMMA we did a stem cell paste graft ,COMMA which we designed in <NUM> ,COMMA to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there .PERIOD 
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left ,COMMA and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen ,COMMA and doing well .PERIOD 
The girl on the video ,COMMA Jen Hudak ,COMMA just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee ,COMMA as you see in the other image -DASH -DASH and having a paste graft to that knee .PERIOD 
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .PERIOD 
So with all this success ,COMMA why isn't that good enough ,COMMA you might ask .PERIOD 
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles .PERIOD 
There's not enough young ,COMMA healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us .PERIOD 
And the tissue's very expensive .PERIOD 
But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful ,COMMA it's cheap ,COMMA you can get it from young ,COMMA healthy tissues ,COMMA but the barrier is immunology .PERIOD 
And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl ,COMMA or gal epitope .PERIOD 
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people ,COMMA we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope .PERIOD 
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon ,COMMA where we would take the cow Achilles tendon ,COMMA which is type-I collagen ,COMMA strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template .PERIOD 
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee .PERIOD 
We've now done that procedure ,COMMA and it's been done worldwide in over <NUM> cases ,COMMA so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus .PERIOD 
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue .PERIOD 
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament ?QUESTIONMARK 
I can't grind it up in a blender .PERIOD 
So in that case ,COMMA I have to design -DASH -DASH and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -DASH -DASH an enzyme wash to wash away ,COMMA or strip ,COMMA those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme .PERIOD 
And we call that a gal stripping technique .PERIOD 
What we do is humanize the tissue .PERIOD 
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it ,COMMA and then we can put it back into a patient's knee .PERIOD 
And we've done that .PERIOD Now we've taken pig ligament -DASH -DASH young ,COMMA healthy ,COMMA big tissue ,COMMA put it into <NUM> patients in an FDA-approved trial -DASH -DASH and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships -DASH -DASH on his pig-lig ,COMMA as he calls it .PERIOD So we know it can work .PERIOD 
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending .PERIOD 
So what about the next step ?QUESTIONMARK 
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement ,COMMA not just the parts ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well here's how we're going to do it .PERIOD 
So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young ,COMMA healthy pig ,COMMA strip it of its antigens ,COMMA load it with your stem cells ,COMMA then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee ,COMMA tack it on there ,COMMA have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee .PERIOD 
So that's our biologic approach right now .PERIOD 
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts .PERIOD 
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface .PERIOD 
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom .PERIOD 
There's a benefit of <NUM> million years of ambulation .PERIOD 
We can harness those benefits .PERIOD 
We can use thicker ,COMMA younger ,COMMA better tissues than you might have injured in your knee ,COMMA or that you might have when you're <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> .PERIOD 
We can do it as an outpatient procedure .PERIOD 
We can strip that tissue very economically ,COMMA and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global .PERIOD 
And so welcome to super biologics .PERIOD 
It's not hardware .PERIOD 
It's not software .PERIOD 
It's bioware .PERIOD 
It's version <NUM> of you .PERIOD 
And so with that ,COMMA coming to a -DASH -DASH coming to an operating theater near you soon ,COMMA I believe .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years ,COMMA and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet .PERIOD 
This is an example of a real meteorite ,COMMA and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth ,COMMA and just how much of it survives and melts .PERIOD 
From a meteorite from space ,COMMA we’re over here with an original Sputnik .PERIOD 
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space .PERIOD 
This is not a copy .PERIOD 
And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back ,COMMA on Apollo <NUM> .PERIOD 
The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits .PERIOD 
So this has actually been carried to the moon and back .PERIOD 
The dawn of books is ,COMMA of course ,COMMA important .PERIOD 
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible .PERIOD 
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible ,COMMA and the dawn of this technology ,COMMA is not the book .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA the book was not driven by reading .PERIOD 
So why did the printing press succeed ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible .PERIOD 
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
We are living at the age here at the end of the book ,COMMA where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it .PERIOD 
It turns out that in the 1450s ,COMMA the Catholic Church needed money ,COMMA and so they actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences ,COMMA which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper .PERIOD 
They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands .PERIOD 
They got you out of purgatory faster .PERIOD 
And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences ,COMMA which was the equivalent of printing money .PERIOD 
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in <NUM> -DASH -DASH to print out thousands ,COMMA and then hundreds of thousands ,COMMA and then ultimately millions of single ,COMMA small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven .PERIOD 
So the printing press ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading .PERIOD 
More tomorrow .PERIOD I also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .PERIOD 
We’re going to have some tomorrow .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world .PERIOD 
You’re going to find out why in a minute ,COMMA because when I went to see Eileen ,COMMA this is what I said I wanted to build .PERIOD 
This is the Library of Human Imagination .PERIOD 
The room itself is three stories tall .PERIOD 
In the glass panels are <NUM> years of human imagination that are computer controlled .PERIOD 
The room is a theatre .PERIOD It changes colors .PERIOD 
It’s designed like an Escher print .PERIOD 
Here is some of the lower level of the library ,COMMA where the exhibits constantly change .PERIOD 
You can walk through .PERIOD You can touch .PERIOD 
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room .PERIOD 
There’s my very own Saturn V .PERIOD 
Everybody should have one ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
So you can see here in the lower level of the library the books and the objects .PERIOD 
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination .PERIOD 
There is a glass bridge that you walk across that’s suspended in space .PERIOD 
So it’s a leap of imagination .PERIOD 
How do we create ?QUESTIONMARK 
Part of the question that I have answered is ,COMMA is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli :COLON with human achievement ,COMMA with history ,COMMA with the things that drive us and make us human -DASH -DASH the passionate discovery ,COMMA the bones of dinosaurs long gone ,COMMA the maps of space that we’ve experienced ,COMMA and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination .PERIOD 
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show one or two more objects from the stage ,COMMA but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .PERIOD 
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community .PERIOD 
TED is all about patterns in the clouds .PERIOD 
It’s all about connections .PERIOD 
It’s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before .PERIOD 
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA we can look at a DNA molecule model here .PERIOD 
None of us really have ever seen one ,COMMA but we know it exists because we’ve been taught to understand this molecule .PERIOD 
But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you might say ,COMMA what does this have to do with this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA this is the code for life ,COMMA and this is a code for death .PERIOD 
These two molecules code and decode .PERIOD 
But once you’ve seen them in a new way ,COMMA you realize that both of these things really are connected .PERIOD 
And they’re connected primarily because of this here .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA this is a human brain model ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it’s rare ,COMMA because we never really get to see a brain .PERIOD 
We get to see a skull .PERIOD But there it is .PERIOD 
All of imagination -DASH -DASH everything that we think ,COMMA we feel ,COMMA we sense -DASH -DASH comes through the human brain .PERIOD 
And once we create new patterns in this brain ,COMMA once we shape the brain in a new way ,COMMA it never returns to its original shape .PERIOD 
And I’ll give you a quick example .PERIOD 
We think about the Internet ;SEMICOLON we think about information that goes across the Internet .PERIOD 
And we never think about the hidden connection .PERIOD 
But I brought along here a lump of coal -DASH -DASH right here ,COMMA one lump of coal .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net .PERIOD 
So every time you download a file ,COMMA each megabyte is a lump of coal .PERIOD 
So the next time you download a gigabyte ,COMMA or two gigabytes ,COMMA it’s not for free ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,COMMA and to make everything we think possible ,COMMA possible .PERIOD 
Thanks ,COMMA Chris .PERIOD 
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem .PERIOD 
Oh beloved dentist :COLON Your rubber fingers in my mouth .. .PERIOD 
your voice so soft and muffled .. .PERIOD 
Lower the mask ,COMMA dear dentist ,COMMA lower the mask .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA in this presentation ,COMMA I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout .PERIOD 
You're going to see a lot of imagery ,COMMA and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about ,COMMA so I need you to kind of split your brains in half and let the images flow over one side and listen to me on the other .PERIOD 
So I am one of those people with a transformative personal story .PERIOD 
Six years ago ,COMMA after <NUM> years in graphic design and typography ,COMMA I changed the way I was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work ,COMMA with only the humble attempt to simply make a living doing something that I loved .PERIOD 
But something weird happened .PERIOD 
I became bizarrely popular .PERIOD 
My current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that I still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on .PERIOD 
And I'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what I do may be connected to why I do it .PERIOD 
These days ,COMMA I call myself a graphic artist .PERIOD 
So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy ,COMMA my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is heresy in the design world .PERIOD 
But I find that for myself ,COMMA without exception ,COMMA the more I deal with the work as something of my own ,COMMA as something that is personal ,COMMA the more successful it is as something that's compelling ,COMMA interesting and sustaining .PERIOD 
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking .PERIOD 
Where others might look at measurable results ,COMMA I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities ,COMMA like Does it bring joy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is there a sense of wonder ?QUESTIONMARK 
and Does it invoke curiosity ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a scientific diagram ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
I don't have time to explain it ,COMMA but it has to do with DNA and RNA .PERIOD 
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work .PERIOD 
The things that interest me when I'm working are visual structure ,COMMA surprise and anything that requires figuring things out .PERIOD 
So for this reason ,COMMA I'm particularly drawn to systems and patterns .PERIOD 
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works .PERIOD 
This is a piece that I did for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K .PERIOD 
They have a magazine that they call G2 .PERIOD 
And this is for their puzzle special in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And puzzling it is .PERIOD 
I started by creating a series of tiling units .PERIOD 
And these tiling units ,COMMA I designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that I could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the abstract patterning .PERIOD 
But then as well ,COMMA I was able to just flip them ,COMMA rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns .PERIOD 
So here's the word puzzle again .PERIOD 
And here it is with the abstract surrounding .PERIOD 
And as you can see ,COMMA it's extremely difficult to read .PERIOD 
But all I have to do is fill certain areas of those letterforms and I can bring those words out of the background pattern .PERIOD 
But maybe that's a little too obvious .PERIOD 
I'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways .PERIOD 
So this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will .PERIOD 
So ultimately ,COMMA my goal is to create something unexpected .PERIOD 
To this end ,COMMA I have worked in sugar for Stefan Sagmeister ,COMMA three-time TED speaker .PERIOD 
And this project began essentially on my kitchen table .PERIOD 
I've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .PERIOD 
And for that same amount of time ,COMMA I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers .PERIOD 
And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork .PERIOD 
And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book ,COMMA Things in My Life I've Learned So Far .PERIOD 
And these were created without sketches ,COMMA just freehand ,COMMA by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it .PERIOD 
Recently ,COMMA I've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta .PERIOD 
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book ,COMMA and the chapter is on honor .PERIOD 
So it's a little bit unexpected ,COMMA but ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA it refers to the macaroni art that children make for their parents or they make in school and give to their parents ,COMMA which is in itself a form of honor .PERIOD 
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA well ,COMMA it's what I can do with some household tinfoil .PERIOD 
I'm very interested in wonder ,COMMA in design as an impetus to inquiring .PERIOD 
To say I wonder is to say I question ,COMMA I ask .PERIOD 
And to experience wonder is to experience awe .PERIOD 
The world is full of wonder .PERIOD 
But the world of graphic design ,COMMA for the most part ,COMMA is not .PERIOD 
So I'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force .PERIOD 
I think that one of the things that religions got right was the use of visual wonder to deliver a message .PERIOD 
I think this true marriage of art and information is woefully underused in adult literature ,COMMA and I'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth .PERIOD 
When we look at works like this ,COMMA we tend to associate them with children's literature .PERIOD 
There's an implication that ornamental graphics detract from the seriousness of the content .PERIOD 
But I really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception .PERIOD 
This book is taking rather a long time ,COMMA but I'm nearly done .PERIOD 
For some reason ,COMMA I thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk .PERIOD 
And this is it -DASH -DASH just to give you and me a moment to catch up .PERIOD 
So I do these valentines .PERIOD 
These are my valentines from <NUM> and <NUM> .PERIOD 
And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person .PERIOD 
But in <NUM> ,COMMA I got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list .PERIOD 
I reduced my mailing list to <NUM> people .PERIOD 
And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out .PERIOD 
Believe it or not ,COMMA I devised this as a timesaving method .PERIOD 
I was very busy in the beginning of that year ,COMMA and I didn't know when I was going to find time to design and print a single valentine .PERIOD 
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal as I was traveling .PERIOD 
It didn't exactly work out that way .PERIOD 
And those who didn't respond will never receive anything from me ever again .PERIOD 
Last year ,COMMA I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine .PERIOD 
I wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me ,COMMA something that caused them to wonder what on Earth this thing was .PERIOD 
There were four different versions of this .PERIOD 
And I wrote them so that they begin in the middle of a sentence ,COMMA end in the middle of a sentence .PERIOD 
And they're on the one hand ,COMMA universal ,COMMA so I avoid specific names or places ,COMMA but on the other hand ,COMMA they're personal .PERIOD 
So I wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them .PERIOD 
And I'm just going to read one of them to you .PERIOD 
You've never really been sure of this ,COMMA but I can assure you that this quirk you're so self-conscious of is intensely endearing .PERIOD 
Just please accept that this piece of you escapes with your smile ,COMMA and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing .PERIOD 
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds ,COMMA but without the scratches and bird shit .PERIOD 
That is to say ,COMMA your thoughts and words flit and dart ,COMMA disconcertedly elusive at times ,COMMA but when caught and examined -DASH -DASH ahh ,COMMA such a wonder ,COMMA such a delightful reward .PERIOD 
There's no passing time with you ,COMMA only collecting -DASH -DASH the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release .PERIOD 
Impossible ?QUESTIONMARK I don't think so .PERIOD 
I know this makes you embarrassed .PERIOD 
But I just have to tell you because sometimes I hear your self-doubt ,COMMA and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are ,COMMA how inspiring and delightful and really ,COMMA truly the most completely .. .PERIOD 
So Valentine's Day is coming up in a couple of days ,COMMA and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world .PERIOD 
This year ,COMMA I got ,COMMA what I really have to say is a rather brilliant idea ,COMMA to laser cut my valentines out of used Christmas cards .PERIOD 
Each one of them is completely different .PERIOD 
I'm just really ,COMMA really thrilled with them .PERIOD 
I don't have that much else to say ,COMMA but they turned out really well .PERIOD 
I do spend a lot of time on my work .PERIOD 
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently is what is worth while .PERIOD 
What is it that's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way ?QUESTIONMARK 
Working in the commercial world ,COMMA this is something that I do have to struggle with at times .PERIOD 
And yes ,COMMA sometimes I'm swayed by money .PERIOD 
But ultimately ,COMMA I don't consider that a worthy goal .PERIOD 
What makes something worthwhile for me is the people I work for or with ,COMMA the conditions I work under and the audience that I'm able to reach .PERIOD 
So I might ask :COLON Who is it for ?QUESTIONMARK 
and What does it do ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA I have to tell you ,COMMA it's really difficult for someone like me to come up on stage at this conference with these unbelievably brilliant minds ,COMMA who are thinking these really big-picture ,COMMA world-changing ,COMMA life-changing ideas and technologies .PERIOD 
And it's very ,COMMA very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we're not contributing enough ,COMMA or worse ,COMMA that all we're doing is contributing to landfill .PERIOD 
Here I am ;SEMICOLON I'm showing you some pretty visuals and talking about aesthetics .PERIOD 
But I've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society .PERIOD 
Just in the way that I'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds ,COMMA conversations I have ,COMMA movies ,COMMA so I also think ,COMMA when I put visual work out there into the mass media ,COMMA work that is interesting ,COMMA unusual ,COMMA intriguing ,COMMA work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind ,COMMA that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace .PERIOD 
And you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else ,COMMA because inspiration is cross-pollinating .PERIOD 
So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist ,COMMA and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter .PERIOD 
And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure ,COMMA and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure .PERIOD 
But I really believe that a fully operating ,COMMA rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing .PERIOD 
Let me introduce to you Rezero .PERIOD 
This little fellow was developed by a group of <NUM> undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich .PERIOD 
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .PERIOD 
Instead of wheels ,COMMA a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .PERIOD 
This means that the robot is inherently unstable .PERIOD 
It's like when I am trying to stand on one foot .PERIOD 
You might ask yourself ,COMMA what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now we'll explain that in a second .PERIOD 
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance .PERIOD 
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .PERIOD 
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately .PERIOD 
This happens <NUM> times per second ,COMMA and if anything fails in this process ,COMMA Rezero would immediately fall to the ground .PERIOD 
Now to move and to balance ,COMMA Rezero needs to turn the ball .PERIOD 
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .PERIOD 
Due to his instability ,COMMA Rezero is always in motion .PERIOD Now here's the trick .PERIOD 
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [dynamically] .PERIOD 
Let's play a little .PERIOD 
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push .PERIOD 
In this mode ,COMMA he's trying to maintain his position .PERIOD 
For the next demo ,COMMA I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael ,COMMA on the computer ,COMMA and Thomas who's helping me onstage .PERIOD 
In the next mode ,COMMA Rezero is passive ,COMMA and we can move him around .PERIOD 
With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity .PERIOD 
I can also make him spin .PERIOD 
In the next mode ,COMMA we can get Rezero to follow a person .PERIOD 
This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of Rezero .PERIOD 
With the same method ,COMMA we can also get him to circle a person .PERIOD 
We call this the orbiting mode .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA thank you ,COMMA Thomas .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what's the use of this technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
For now ,COMMA it's an experiment ,COMMA but let me show you some possible future applications .PERIOD 
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .PERIOD 
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .PERIOD 
In a hospital ,COMMA this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .PERIOD 
Due to the Ballbot system ,COMMA it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around .PERIOD 
And these are more practical applications .PERIOD 
But there's also a certain beauty within this technology .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I became an inventor by accident .PERIOD 
I was out of the air force in <NUM> .PERIOD No ,COMMA no ,COMMA that's not true :COLON I went in in <NUM> ,COMMA came out in <NUM> ,COMMA was working at the University of Washington ,COMMA and I came up with an idea ,COMMA from reading a magazine article ,COMMA for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that was before cassette tapes ,COMMA C.D.s ,COMMA DVDs -DASH -DASH any of the cool stuff we've got now .PERIOD 
And it was an arm that ,COMMA instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record ,COMMA went straight :COLON a radial ,COMMA linear tracking tone arm .PERIOD 
And it was the hardest invention I ever made ,COMMA but it got me started ,COMMA and I got really lucky after that .PERIOD 
And without giving you too much of a tirade ,COMMA I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today :COLON my 44th invention .PERIOD No ,COMMA that's not true either .PERIOD 
Golly ,COMMA I'm just totally losing it .PERIOD 
My 44th patent ;SEMICOLON about the 15th invention .PERIOD 
I call this hypersonic sound .PERIOD 
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes ,COMMA but I want to make an analogy before I do to this .PERIOD 
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say ,COMMA That's really cool ,COMMA but what's it good for ?QUESTIONMARK 
Sound ,COMMA light :COLON I'm going to draw the analogy .PERIOD 
When Edison invented the light bulb ,COMMA pretty much looked like this .PERIOD 
Hasn't changed that much .PERIOD 
Light came out of it in every direction .PERIOD 
Before the light bulb was invented ,COMMA people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it ,COMMA focus it a little bit ;SEMICOLON put lenses in front of it ,COMMA focus it a little bit better .PERIOD 
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb ,COMMA but you couldn't focus light ;SEMICOLON if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to .PERIOD 
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are .PERIOD 
You turn on the loudspeaker ,COMMA and after almost <NUM> years of having those gadgets ,COMMA the sound just kind of goes where it wants .PERIOD 
A little bit of differential ,COMMA but not much .PERIOD 
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is ,COMMA and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it ,COMMA we wouldn't have that ,COMMA or movies in general ,COMMA or computers ,COMMA or T.V .PERIOD sets ,COMMA or C.D.s ,COMMA or DVDs -DASH -DASH and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA after almost <NUM> years of having sound ,COMMA I thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to .PERIOD 
I have a couple of units .PERIOD 
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car -DASH -DASH small version ,COMMA over your head -DASH -DASH so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car .PERIOD 
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you .PERIOD 
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room .PERIOD 
The sound is being made right next to your ears .PERIOD Is that cool ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because I have some limited time ,COMMA I'll cut it off for a second ,COMMA and tell you about how it works and what it's good for .PERIOD 
Course ,COMMA like light ,COMMA it's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack ,COMMA or the cornflakes ,COMMA or the toothpaste ,COMMA or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby .PERIOD 
Sony's got an idea -DASH -DASH Sony's our biggest customers right now .PERIOD 
They tried this back in the '60s and were too smart ,COMMA and so they gave up .PERIOD 
But they want to use it -DASH -DASH seriously .PERIOD 
There's a mix an inventor has to have .PERIOD 
Too many other smart people out there .PERIOD So .PERIOD 
I just happened to get my education in a little different way .PERIOD 
I'm not at all against education .PERIOD 
I think it's wonderful ;SEMICOLON I think sometimes people ,COMMA when they get educated ,COMMA lose it :COLON they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than .PERIOD 
And we're living in a great time right now ,COMMA because almost everything's being explored anew .PERIOD 
I have this little slogan that I use a lot ,COMMA which is :COLON virtually nothing -DASH -DASH and I mean this honestly -DASH -DASH has been invented yet .PERIOD 
We're just starting .PERIOD 
And this is ,COMMA I hope ,COMMA a little piece of it .PERIOD 
Sony's got this vision back -DASH -DASH to get myself on track -DASH -DASH that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket ,COMMA you're going to watch a new T.V .PERIOD channel .PERIOD 
They know that when you watch T.V .PERIOD at home ,COMMA because there are so many choices you can change channels ,COMMA miss their commercials .PERIOD 
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed ,COMMA because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and reaches out ,COMMA turns off the sound .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if the sound isn't there ,COMMA the sale typically isn't made .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA like ,COMMA when you're on an airplane ,COMMA they show the movie ,COMMA you get to watch it for free ;SEMICOLON when you want to hear the sound ,COMMA you pay .PERIOD 
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -DASH -DASH initially it'll be Safeways .PERIOD It is Safeways ;SEMICOLON they're trying this in three parts of the country right now -DASH -DASH you'll be watching TV .PERIOD 
And hopefully they'll be sensitive that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet .PERIOD 
But what's great about it ,COMMA from the tests that have been done ,COMMA is ,COMMA if you don't want to hear it ,COMMA you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we create silence as much as we create sound .PERIOD 
ATMs that talk to you ;SEMICOLON nobody else hears it .PERIOD 
Sit in bed ,COMMA two in the morning ,COMMA watch TV ;SEMICOLON your spouse ,COMMA or someone ,COMMA is next to you ,COMMA asleep ;SEMICOLON doesn't hear it ,COMMA doesn't wake up .PERIOD 
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring ,COMMA noise from automobiles .PERIOD 
They have literally beat a path to our door .PERIOD 
We've been selling it since about last September ,COMMA October ,COMMA and it's been immensely gratifying .PERIOD 
If you're interested in what it costs -DASH -DASH I'm not selling them today -DASH -DASH but this unit ,COMMA with the electronics and everything ,COMMA if you buy one ,COMMA is around a thousand bucks .PERIOD 
We expect by this time next year ,COMMA it'll be hundreds ,COMMA a few hundred bucks ,COMMA to buy it .PERIOD 
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when I played it for you ,COMMA you didn't hear the thunderous bass .PERIOD 
The air is not linear ,COMMA as we've always been taught .PERIOD 
You turn up the volume just a little bit -DASH -DASH I'm talking about a little over <NUM> decibels -DASH -DASH and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate .PERIOD 
Here's why :COLON the speed of sound is not a constant .PERIOD It's fairly slow .PERIOD 
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA imagine ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA without getting too technical ,COMMA I'm making a little sine wave here in the air .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if I turn up the amplitude too much ,COMMA I'm having an effect on the pressure ,COMMA which means during the making of that sine wave ,COMMA the speed at which it is propagating is shifting .PERIOD 
All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear .PERIOD 
Linearity means higher quality sound .PERIOD 
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite :COLON it's <NUM> percent based on non-linearity .PERIOD 
An effect happens in the air ,COMMA it's a corrupting effect of the sound -DASH -DASH the ultrasound in this case -DASH -DASH that's emitted ,COMMA but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA where's the sound made ?QUESTIONMARK 
Instead of being made on the face of the cone ,COMMA it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air ,COMMA and so when I aim it towards you ,COMMA what you hear is made right next to your ears .PERIOD 
I said we can shorten the column ,COMMA we can spread it out to cover the couch .PERIOD 
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker ,COMMA the other ear hears the other .PERIOD That's true binaural sound .PERIOD 
When you listen to stereo on your home system ,COMMA your both ears hear both speakers .PERIOD 
Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the stage is more restricted -DASH -DASH the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you .PERIOD 
Because the sound is made in the air along this column ,COMMA it does not follow the inverse square law ,COMMA which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance :COLON 6dB every time you go from one meter ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA to two meters .PERIOD 
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony ,COMMA and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row ,COMMA now ,COMMA all of a sudden .PERIOD 
Isn't that terrific ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA we've been ,COMMA as I say ,COMMA very successful ,COMMA very lucky ,COMMA in having companies catch the vision of this ,COMMA from cars -DASH -DASH car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids ,COMMA and a separate system in the back -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA the kids aren't driving today .PERIOD 
I was seeing if you were listening .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA I haven't had breakfast yet .PERIOD 
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad ,COMMA and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids ,COMMA and the parents don't want to be bothered with that ,COMMA or their rap music or whatever .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA again ,COMMA this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on .PERIOD 
It also works for transmitting and communicating data .PERIOD 
It also works five times better underwater .PERIOD 
We've got the military -DASH -DASH have just deployed some of these into Iraq ,COMMA where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside .PERIOD 
I'm serious .PERIOD And they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance ,COMMA and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift from <NUM> yards away when they play this thing .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't .PERIOD 
We make a version with this which puts out <NUM> decibels .PERIOD 
Pain is <NUM> .PERIOD 
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people ,COMMA and there can be a public beach just off to the side ,COMMA and they don't even know it's turned on .PERIOD 
We sell those to the military presently for about <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and they're buying them as fast as we can make them .PERIOD 
I have a bunch of other inventions .PERIOD 
I invented a plasma antenna ,COMMA to shift gears .PERIOD 
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -DASH -DASH I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -DASH -DASH and my physicist CEO came in and said ,COMMA We have a real problem .PERIOD 
We're using very short wavelengths .PERIOD 
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing .PERIOD 
When you run very short wavelengths ,COMMA like a tuning fork the antenna resonates ,COMMA and there's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we're trying to analyze ,COMMA taking too much processing .PERIOD 
I says ,COMMA Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Turn it on ;SEMICOLON turn it off .PERIOD 
That's a fluorescent tube refined .PERIOD 
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars ,COMMA cash .PERIOD 
Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -DASH -DASH the little cell headphones ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's my invention .PERIOD I sold that for seven million dollars .PERIOD 
Big mistake :COLON it just sold for <NUM> million dollars two years ago .PERIOD 
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer in my attic at my house ,COMMA and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design I drew way back when .PERIOD 
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet .PERIOD 
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA make something out of themselves .PERIOD 
You've been a great audience .PERIOD I know I've jumped all over the place .PERIOD 
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group .PERIOD 
Let me give you ,COMMA in the last minute ,COMMA one more quick demo of this guy ,COMMA for those of you that haven't heard it .PERIOD 
Can never tell if it's on .PERIOD 
If you haven't heard it ,COMMA raise your hand .PERIOD 
Getting it over there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Get the cameraman .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA there you go .PERIOD 
Thank you once again .PERIOD 
I brought along with me an abalone shell .PERIOD 
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that's <NUM> percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA it's <NUM> times tougher than its geological counterpart .PERIOD 
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells ,COMMA like chalk .PERIOD 
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure ,COMMA but they're formed at the nanoscale .PERIOD 
They're formed at the nanoscale ,COMMA and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures .PERIOD 
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures ,COMMA like batteries and like solar cells ?QUESTIONMARK 
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did ,COMMA in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure ,COMMA using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or ,COMMA what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time ,COMMA and do so in an environmentally friendly way ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so ,COMMA going back to this abalone shell ,COMMA besides being nano-structured ,COMMA one thing that's fascinating ,COMMA is when a male and a female abalone get together ,COMMA they pass on the genetic information that says ,COMMA This is how to build an exquisite material .PERIOD 
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure ,COMMA using non-toxic materials .PERIOD 
Same with diatoms ,COMMA which are shown right here ,COMMA which are glasseous structures .PERIOD 
Every time the diatoms replicate ,COMMA they give the genetic information that says ,COMMA Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nano-structured .PERIOD 
And you can do it the same ,COMMA over and over again .PERIOD 
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery ?QUESTIONMARK 
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .PERIOD 
But anyone who's ever had ,COMMA or knows ,COMMA small children knows they're incredibly complex organisms .PERIOD 
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do ,COMMA it's very difficult .PERIOD 
So when we think about future technologies ,COMMA we actually think of using bacteria and virus ,COMMA simple organisms .PERIOD 
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox ,COMMA so that they can build a structure that will be important to me ?QUESTIONMARK 
Also ,COMMA when we think about future technologies ,COMMA we start with the beginning of Earth .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA it took a billion years to have life on Earth .PERIOD 
And very rapidly ,COMMA they became multi-cellular ,COMMA they could replicate ,COMMA they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source .PERIOD 
But it wasn't until about <NUM> million years ago -DASH -DASH during the Cambrian geologic time period -DASH -DASH that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials .PERIOD 
Before that ,COMMA they were all soft ,COMMA fluffy structures .PERIOD 
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment ,COMMA and organisms learned how to make hard materials .PERIOD 
And so that's what I would like be able to do -DASH -DASH convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table .PERIOD 
Now if you look at biology ,COMMA there's many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you've heard about that are already nano-structured .PERIOD 
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .PERIOD 
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV ?QUESTIONMARK 
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?QUESTIONMARK 
So here are some examples :COLON these are some natural shells .PERIOD 
There are natural biological materials .PERIOD 
The abalone shell here -DASH -DASH and if you fracture it ,COMMA you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured .PERIOD 
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale ,COMMA and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA going back to the abalone shell ,COMMA the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins .PERIOD 
These proteins are very negatively charged .PERIOD 
And they can pull calcium out of the environment ,COMMA put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate ,COMMA calcium and carbonate .PERIOD 
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids ,COMMA which says ,COMMA This is how to build the structure .PERIOD 
Here's the DNA sequence ,COMMA here's the protein sequence in order to do it .PERIOD 
And so an interesting idea is ,COMMA what if you could take any material that you wanted ,COMMA or any element on the periodic table ,COMMA and find its corresponding DNA sequence ,COMMA then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure ,COMMA but not build an abalone shell -DASH -DASH build something that ,COMMA through nature ,COMMA it has never had the opportunity to work with yet .PERIOD 
And so here's the periodic table .PERIOD 
And I absolutely love the periodic table .PERIOD 
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT ,COMMA I have a periodic table made that says ,COMMA Welcome to MIT .PERIOD Now you're in your element .PERIOD 
And you flip it over ,COMMA and it's the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges .PERIOD 
And so I give this out to thousands of people .PERIOD 
And I know it says MIT ,COMMA and this is Caltech ,COMMA but I have a couple extra if people want it .PERIOD 
So I stayed up at night ,COMMA and I talked to my husband ,COMMA How do I give President Obama a periodic table ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -DASH -DASH it was a great visit .PERIOD 
And then afterward ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Sir ,COMMA I want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight .PERIOD 
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass .PERIOD 
And so he looked at it ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Thank you .PERIOD I'll look at it periodically .PERIOD 
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy ,COMMA he pulled it out and said ,COMMA And people at MIT ,COMMA they give out periodic tables .PERIOD 
So basically what I didn't tell you is that about <NUM> million years ago ,COMMA organisms starter making materials ,COMMA but it took them about <NUM> million years to get good at it .PERIOD 
It took them about <NUM> million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell .PERIOD 
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student .PERIOD 
I have this great project -DASH -DASH <NUM> million years .PERIOD 
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly .PERIOD 
And so we use a virus that's a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that's job is to infect bacteria .PERIOD 
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it .PERIOD 
And by doing that ,COMMA it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .PERIOD 
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .PERIOD 
And you could basically do this a billion times .PERIOD 
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical ,COMMA but they differ from each other based on their tips ,COMMA on one sequence that codes for one protein .PERIOD 
And through a process of selection evolution ,COMMA you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you'd like it to do ,COMMA like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .PERIOD 
Once you find that one out of a billion ,COMMA you infect it into a bacteria ,COMMA and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence .PERIOD 
And so the other thing that's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales .PERIOD 
And these viruses are long and skinny ,COMMA and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries .PERIOD 
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab .PERIOD 
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .PERIOD 
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .PERIOD 
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery .PERIOD 
And then it wires itself to the current collector .PERIOD 
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference .PERIOD 
I brought it here .PERIOD 
You can see it in this case -DASH -DASH that's lighting this LED .PERIOD 
Now if we could scale this ,COMMA you could actually use it to run your Prius ,COMMA which is my dream -DASH -DASH to be able to drive a virus-powered car .PERIOD 
But it's basically -DASH -DASH you can pull one out of a billion .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA you make an amplification in the lab ,COMMA and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery .PERIOD 
We're able to do this also with catalysis .PERIOD 
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .PERIOD 
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna ,COMMA and you get an energy transfer across the virus .PERIOD 
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels .PERIOD 
And I brought an example with me of that today .PERIOD 
My students promised me it would work .PERIOD 
These are virus-assembled nanowires .PERIOD 
And basically ,COMMA by controlling the genes ,COMMA you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance .PERIOD 
You can also do this with solar cells .PERIOD 
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -DASH -DASH and use as a way of getting electrons through the device .PERIOD 
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward .PERIOD 
So this is a virus-based solar cell .PERIOD 
Through evolution and selection ,COMMA we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an <NUM> percent efficiency solar cell .PERIOD 
So I hope that I've convinced you that there's a lot of great ,COMMA interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -DASH -DASH and taking it the next step to see if you can force ,COMMA or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials ,COMMA to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So I'm going to talk about work ,COMMA specifically why people can't seem to get work done at work ,COMMA which is a problem we all kind of have .PERIOD 
But let's ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA start at the beginning .PERIOD 
So we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .PERIOD 
And they expect these people who work for them to do great work -DASH -DASH I would hope ,COMMA at least .PERIOD 
At least good work ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA at least it's good work -DASH -DASH hopefully great work .PERIOD 
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work .PERIOD 
So a company ,COMMA or a charity ,COMMA or an organization of any kind ,COMMA they typically -DASH -DASH unless you're working in Africa ,COMMA if you're really lucky to do that -DASH -DASH most people have to go to an office every day .PERIOD 
And so these companies ,COMMA they build offices .PERIOD 
They go out and they buy a building ,COMMA or they rent a building ,COMMA or they lease some space ,COMMA and they fill the space with stuff .PERIOD 
They fill it with tables ,COMMA or desks ,COMMA chairs ,COMMA computer equipment ,COMMA software ,COMMA Internet access ,COMMA maybe a fridge ,COMMA maybe a few other things ,COMMA and they expect their employees ,COMMA or their volunteers ,COMMA to come to that location every day to do great work .PERIOD 
It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA if you actually talk to people and even question yourself ,COMMA and you ask yourself ,COMMA where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?QUESTIONMARK 
You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say .PERIOD 
If you ask people the question :COLON where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ?QUESTIONMARK 
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .PERIOD 
One is kind of a place or a location or a room .PERIOD 
Another one is a moving object and a third is a time .PERIOD 
So here's some examples .PERIOD 
When I ask people -DASH -DASH and I've been asking people this question for about <NUM> years -DASH -DASH I ask them ,COMMA Where do you go when you really need to get something done ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'll hear things like ,COMMA the porch ,COMMA the deck ,COMMA the kitchen .PERIOD 
And then you'll hear people say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA it doesn't really matter where I am ,COMMA as long as it's really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends .PERIOD 
You almost never hear someone say the office .PERIOD 
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office ,COMMA and they're making people go to it all the time ,COMMA yet people don't do work in the office .PERIOD 
What is that about ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what you find out is that ,COMMA if you dig a little bit deeper ,COMMA you find out that people -DASH -DASH this is what happens -DASH -DASH people go to work ,COMMA and they're basically trading in their workday for a series of work moments .PERIOD 
That's what happens at the office .PERIOD 
Then you have something else to do .PERIOD 
Then you've got <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and someone pulls you aside and asks you this question ,COMMA and before you know it ,COMMA it's <NUM> p.m. ,COMMA and you look back on the day ,COMMA and you realize that you didn't get anything done .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we've all been through this .PERIOD 
We probably went through it yesterday ,COMMA or the day before ,COMMA or the day before that .PERIOD 
You look back on your day ,COMMA and you're like ,COMMA I got nothing done today .PERIOD 
I was at work .PERIOD 
I used the software they told me to use .PERIOD 
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .PERIOD 
I did these conference calls .PERIOD I did all this stuff .PERIOD 
But I didn't actually do anything .PERIOD 
I just did tasks .PERIOD 
I didn't actually get meaningful work done .PERIOD 
And what you find is that ,COMMA especially with creative people -DASH -DASH designers ,COMMA programmers ,COMMA writers ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA thinkers -DASH -DASH that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done .PERIOD 
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in <NUM> minutes and really think about a problem .PERIOD 
And even though the workday is typically eight hours ,COMMA how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office ?QUESTIONMARK 
How about seven hours ?QUESTIONMARK 
Six ?QUESTIONMARK Five ?QUESTIONMARK Four ?QUESTIONMARK 
When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office ?QUESTIONMARK 
Two hours ?QUESTIONMARK One ,COMMA maybe ?QUESTIONMARK 
Very ,COMMA very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office .PERIOD 
And this is why people choose to do work at home ,COMMA or they might go to the office ,COMMA but they might go to the office really early in the day ,COMMA or late at night when no one's around ,COMMA or they stick around after everyone's left ,COMMA or they go in on the weekends ,COMMA or they get work done on the plane ,COMMA or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions .PERIOD 
And this sort of whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted ,COMMA and that is sleep .PERIOD 
I think that sleep and work are very closely related ,COMMA and it's not just that you can work while you're sleeping and you can sleep while you're working .PERIOD 
That's not really what I mean .PERIOD 
I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phased-based ,COMMA or stage-based ,COMMA events .PERIOD 
There's five of them ,COMMA and in order to get to the really deep ones ,COMMA the really meaningful ones ,COMMA you have to go through the early ones .PERIOD 
And if you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones -DASH -DASH if someone bumps you in bed ,COMMA or if there's a sound ,COMMA or whatever happens -DASH -DASH you don't just pick up where you left off .PERIOD 
So you have to go back a few phases and start again .PERIOD 
And what ends up happening -DASH -DASH sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning ,COMMA or seven in the morning ,COMMA or whenever you get up ,COMMA and you're like ,COMMA man ,COMMA I didn't really sleep very well .PERIOD 
I did the sleep thing -DASH -DASH I went to bed ,COMMA I laid down -DASH -DASH but I didn't really sleep .PERIOD 
People say you go to sleep ,COMMA but you really don't go to sleep ,COMMA you go towards sleep .PERIOD 
It just takes a while .PERIOD You've got to go through these phases and stuff ,COMMA and if you're interrupted ,COMMA you don't sleep well .PERIOD 
So how do we expect -DASH -DASH does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they're interrupted all night ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why do we expect people to work well if they're being interrupted all day at the office ?QUESTIONMARK 
How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they're going to the office to be interrupted ?QUESTIONMARK 
That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .PERIOD 
So what are these interruptions that happen at the office that don't happen at other places ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because in other places ,COMMA you can have interruptions ,COMMA like ,COMMA you can have the TV ,COMMA or you could go for a walk ,COMMA or there's a fridge downstairs ,COMMA or you've got your own couch ,COMMA or whatever you want to do .PERIOD 
And if you talk to certain managers ,COMMA they'll tell you that they don't want their employees to work at home because of these distractions .PERIOD 
And I'm one of these managers .PERIOD 
I understand .PERIOD I know how this goes .PERIOD 
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .PERIOD 
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions .PERIOD 
I can't let someone work at home .PERIOD 
They'll watch TV .PERIOD They'll do this other thing .PERIOD 
It turns out that those aren't the things that are really distracting .PERIOD 
Because those are voluntary distractions .PERIOD 
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .PERIOD 
You decide when you want to turn something on .PERIOD 
You decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk .PERIOD 
At the office ,COMMA most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary .PERIOD 
So let's go through a couple of those .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work .PERIOD 
Some of you may work at places where you can't get to these certain sites .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA is this China ?QUESTIONMARK What the hell is going on here ?QUESTIONMARK 
You can't go to a website at work ,COMMA and that's the problem ,COMMA that's why people aren't getting work done ,COMMA because they're going to Facebook and they're going to Twitter ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's kind of ridiculous .PERIOD It's a total decoy .PERIOD 
And today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube ,COMMA these things are just modern-day smoke breaks .PERIOD 
Those aren't the real problems in the office .PERIOD 
The real problems are what I like to call the M&amp ;SEMICOLON Ms ,COMMA the Managers and the Meetings .PERIOD 
And this is why things don't get done at work -DASH -DASH it's because of the M&amp ;SEMICOLON Ms .PERIOD 
Now what's interesting is ,COMMA if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work -DASH -DASH like at home ,COMMA or in a car ,COMMA or on a plane ,COMMA or late at night ,COMMA or early in the morning -DASH -DASH you don't find managers and meetings .PERIOD 
You find a lot of other distractions ,COMMA but you don't find managers and meetings .PERIOD 
So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere ,COMMA but you do find at the office .PERIOD 
And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people .PERIOD 
That's pretty much what managers are for .PERIOD They're for interrupting people .PERIOD 
They don't really do the work ,COMMA so they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work ,COMMA which is an interruption .PERIOD 
And we have a lot of managers in the world now ,COMMA and there's a lot of people in the world now ,COMMA and there's a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers .PERIOD 
They have to check in :COLON Hey ,COMMA how's it going ?QUESTIONMARK 
Show me what's up ,COMMA and this sort of thing and they keep interrupting you at the wrong time ,COMMA while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do ,COMMA they tend to interrupt you .PERIOD 
But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all ,COMMA which is call meetings .PERIOD 
We all know this to be true ,COMMA and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .PERIOD 
It doesn't work that way .PERIOD 
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together ,COMMA and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -DASH -DASH is to say ,COMMA Hey look ,COMMA we're going to bring <NUM> people together right now and have a meeting .PERIOD 
I don't care what you're doing .PERIOD 
Just ,COMMA you've got to stop doing what you're doing ,COMMA so you can have this meeting .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA what are the chances that all <NUM> people are ready to stop ?QUESTIONMARK 
What if they're thinking about something important ?QUESTIONMARK 
All of a sudden you're telling them that they have to stop doing that to do something else .PERIOD 
So they go into a meeting room ,COMMA they get together ,COMMA and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter usually .PERIOD 
Because meetings aren't work .PERIOD 
Meetings are places to go to talk about things you're supposed to be doing later .PERIOD 
But meetings also procreate .PERIOD 
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting and tends to lead to another meeting .PERIOD 
There's often too many people in the meetings ,COMMA and they're very ,COMMA very expensive to the organization .PERIOD 
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting ,COMMA but that's not true ,COMMA unless there's only one person in that meeting .PERIOD 
But instead ,COMMA there's a long scheduled meeting ,COMMA because meetings are scheduled the way software works ,COMMA which is in increments of <NUM> minutes ,COMMA or <NUM> minutes ,COMMA or an hour .PERIOD 
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .PERIOD 
You can't .PERIOD I don't even know if you can .PERIOD 
You can go <NUM> minutes or <NUM> minutes or <NUM> minutes or an hour .PERIOD 
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should really go really quickly .PERIOD 
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today ,COMMA especially to offices .PERIOD 
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .PERIOD 
What can managers do -DASH -DASH enlightened managers ,COMMA hopefully -DASH -DASH what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work ,COMMA so it's not the last resort ,COMMA but it's the first resort ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's that people start to say ,COMMA When I really want to get stuff done ,COMMA I go to the office .PERIOD 
Because the offices are well equipped ,COMMA everything should be there for them to do their work ,COMMA but they don't want to go there right now ,COMMA so how do we change that ?QUESTIONMARK 
I have three suggestions I'll share with you guys .PERIOD 
We've all heard of the casual Friday thing .PERIOD 
But how about no-talk Thursdays ?QUESTIONMARK 
How about -DASH -DASH pick one Thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -DASH -DASH I'll make it really easy for you .PERIOD 
The first Thursday of the month -DASH -DASH just the afternoon -DASH -DASH nobody in the office can talk to each other .PERIOD 
Just silence ,COMMA that's it .PERIOD 
And what you'll find is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done when no one talks to each other .PERIOD 
And you can give someone -DASH -DASH giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work .PERIOD 
It's better than a computer .PERIOD 
It's better than a new monitor .PERIOD It's better than new software ,COMMA or whatever people typically use .PERIOD 
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable .PERIOD 
And if you try that ,COMMA I think you'll find that you agree .PERIOD 
And maybe ,COMMA hopefully you can do it more often .PERIOD 
So maybe it's every other week ,COMMA or every week ,COMMA once a week ,COMMA afternoons no one can talk to each other .PERIOD 
That's something that you'll find will really ,COMMA really work .PERIOD 
Another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration ,COMMA which is like face-to-face stuff ,COMMA tapping people on the shoulder ,COMMA saying hi to them ,COMMA having meetings ,COMMA and replace that with more passive models of communication ,COMMA using things like email and instant messaging ,COMMA or collaboration products -DASH -DASH things like that .PERIOD 
Now some people might say email is really distracting and I.M .PERIOD is really distracting ,COMMA and these other things are really distracting ,COMMA but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing .PERIOD 
You can quit the email app ;SEMICOLON you can't quit your boss .PERIOD 
You can quit I.M. ;SEMICOLON you can't hide your manager .PERIOD 
You can put these things away ,COMMA and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule ,COMMA at your own time ,COMMA when you're available ,COMMA when you're ready to go again .PERIOD 
Because work ,COMMA like sleep ,COMMA happens in phases .PERIOD 
So you're going to be kind of going up and doing some work ,COMMA and then you're going to come down from that work ,COMMA and then maybe it's time to check that email ,COMMA or check that I.M .PERIOD 
And there are very ,COMMA very few things that are that urgent that need to happen ,COMMA that need to be answered right this second .PERIOD 
So if you're a manager ,COMMA start encouraging people to use more things like I.M .PERIOD and email and other things that someone else can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule .PERIOD 
And the last suggestion I have is that ,COMMA if you do have a meeting coming up ,COMMA if you have the power ,COMMA just cancel .PERIOD Just cancel that next meeting .PERIOD 
Today's Friday -DASH -DASH so Monday ,COMMA usually people have meetings on Monday .PERIOD 
Just don't have it .PERIOD 
I don't mean move it ;SEMICOLON I mean just erase it from memory ,COMMA it's gone .PERIOD 
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine .PERIOD 
People have a more open morning ,COMMA they can actually think ,COMMA and you'll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do ,COMMA you don't actually have to do .PERIOD 
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about this .PERIOD 
And I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done .PERIOD 
And I think it'll all pay off in the end .PERIOD 
So thanks for listening .PERIOD 
I live and work from Tokyo ,COMMA Japan .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA to be honest ,COMMA I've been doing this for seven years ,COMMA and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like .PERIOD 
But I've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there .PERIOD 
This is my office .PERIOD It's out there .PERIOD 
It's not in the lab ,COMMA and it's increasingly in places like India ,COMMA China ,COMMA Brazil ,COMMA Africa .PERIOD 
We live on a planet -DASH -DASH <NUM> billion people .PERIOD 
About three billion people ,COMMA by the end of this year ,COMMA will have cellular connectivity .PERIOD 
And I mention this because ,COMMA if we want to design for that future ,COMMA we need to figure out what those people are about .PERIOD 
And that's ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA where I see what my job is and what our team's job is .PERIOD 
Our research often starts with a very simple question .PERIOD 
So I'll give you an example .PERIOD What do you carry ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you think of everything in your life that you own ,COMMA when you walk out that door ,COMMA what do you consider to take with you ?QUESTIONMARK 
When you're looking around ,COMMA what do you consider ?QUESTIONMARK 
Of that stuff ,COMMA what do you carry ?QUESTIONMARK 
And of that stuff ,COMMA what do you actually use ?QUESTIONMARK 
And to put it really bluntly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA people are willing to pay for stuff that has value ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I've probably done about five years' research looking at what people carry .PERIOD 
I go in people's bags .PERIOD I look in people's pockets ,COMMA purses .PERIOD 
I go in their homes .PERIOD And we do this worldwide ,COMMA and we follow them around town with video cameras .PERIOD 
It's kind of like stalking with permission .PERIOD 
And we do all this -DASH -DASH and to go back to the original question ,COMMA what do people carry ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA that's fair enough .PERIOD 
And I'm not saying this is a good thing ,COMMA but this is a thing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to .PERIOD 
You'd probably kick me out ,COMMA or something .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .PERIOD 
But really ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So why are these things so important in our lives ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it turns out ,COMMA from our research ,COMMA that it boils down to survival -DASH -DASH survival for us and survival for our loved ones .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -DASH -DASH transport as well ,COMMA in the U.S .PERIOD increasingly .PERIOD 
Money is useful for buying food ,COMMA sustenance ,COMMA among all its other uses .PERIOD 
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs ,COMMA those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA they do a whole bunch of other stuff ,COMMA but they're very good at this .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA it's the mobile phone's ability to allow people to transcend space and time .PERIOD 
And what I mean by that is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can transcend space by simply making a voice call ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience ,COMMA and someone else can pick it up at their convenience .PERIOD 
And this is fairly universally appreciated ,COMMA it turns out ,COMMA which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected .PERIOD 
And they value that connectivity .PERIOD 
But actually ,COMMA you can do this kind of stuff with PCs .PERIOD 
And you can do them with phone kiosks .PERIOD 
And the mobile phone ,COMMA in addition ,COMMA is both personal -DASH -DASH and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -DASH -DASH and it's convenient .PERIOD 
You don't need to ask permission from anyone ,COMMA you can just go ahead and do it ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
However ,COMMA for these things to help us survive ,COMMA it depends on them being carried .PERIOD 
We're human ,COMMA that's what we do .PERIOD It's one of our features .PERIOD 
So we forget ,COMMA but we're also adaptable ,COMMA and we adapt to situations around us pretty well .PERIOD 
And so we have these strategies to remember ,COMMA and one of them was mentioned yesterday .PERIOD 
And it's ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA the point of reflection .PERIOD 
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space ,COMMA and you turn around ,COMMA and quite often you tap your pockets .PERIOD 
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets .PERIOD 
And you turn around ,COMMA and you look back into the space ,COMMA and some people talk aloud .PERIOD 
And pretty much everyone does it at some point .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA the next thing is -DASH -DASH most of you ,COMMA if you have a stable home life ,COMMA and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time ,COMMA and always in hotels ,COMMA but most people have what we call a center of gravity .PERIOD 
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects .PERIOD 
It's where you expect to find stuff .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA when you're turning around ,COMMA and you're looking inside the house ,COMMA and you're looking for this stuff ,COMMA this is where you look first ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA so when we did this research ,COMMA we found the absolutely ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ,COMMA ever again .PERIOD 
And that is ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA to have nothing to remember .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
But is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA about the art of delegation .PERIOD 
And from a design perspective ,COMMA it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people .PERIOD 
And it turns out ,COMMA delegation -DASH -DASH if you want it to be -DASH -DASH can be the solution for pretty much everything ,COMMA apart from things like bodily functions ,COMMA going to the toilet .PERIOD 
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf .PERIOD 
And apart from things like entertainment ,COMMA you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf ,COMMA or ,COMMA at least ,COMMA not yet .PERIOD 
Maybe sometime in the future ,COMMA we will .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me give you an example of delegation in practice ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
So this is -DASH -DASH probably the thing I'm most passionate about is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the U.N .PERIOD estimated -DASH -DASH this is <NUM> figures -DASH -DASH that there are almost <NUM> million people who can't read and write ,COMMA worldwide .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've been conducting a lot of research .PERIOD 
And one of the things we were looking at is -DASH -DASH if you can't read and write ,COMMA if you want to communicate over distances ,COMMA you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with .PERIOD 
It could be a phone number ,COMMA it could be an e-mail address ,COMMA it could be a postal address .PERIOD 
Simple question :COLON if you can't read and write ,COMMA how do you manage your contact information ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the fact is that millions of people do it .PERIOD 
Just from a design perspective ,COMMA we didn't really understand how they did it ,COMMA and so that's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing .PERIOD 
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation .PERIOD 
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people ,COMMA the stuff that they can't do themselves .PERIOD 
Let me give you another example of delegation .PERIOD 
This one's a little bit more sophisticated ,COMMA and this is from a study that we did in Uganda about how people who are sharing devices ,COMMA use those devices .PERIOD 
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money .PERIOD 
It has a second meaning ,COMMA which is to send money as airtime .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it works like this .PERIOD 
So let's say ,COMMA June ,COMMA you're in a village ,COMMA rural village .PERIOD 
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner .PERIOD 
I'm sending money back ,COMMA and it works like this .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in your village ,COMMA there's one person in the village with a phone ,COMMA and that's the phone kiosk operator .PERIOD 
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk .PERIOD 
So what I do is ,COMMA I buy a prepaid card like this .PERIOD 
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone ,COMMA I call up the local village operator .PERIOD 
And I read out that number to them ,COMMA and they use it to top up their phone .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they're topping up the value from Kampala ,COMMA and it's now being topped up in the village .PERIOD 
You take a <NUM> or <NUM> percent commission ,COMMA and then you -DASH -DASH the kiosk operator takes <NUM> or <NUM> percent commission ,COMMA and passes the rest over to you in cash .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA there's two things I like about this .PERIOD 
So the first is ,COMMA it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -DASH -DASH anyone who has a mobile phone -DASH -DASH essentially into an ATM machine .PERIOD 
It brings rudimentary banking services to places where there's no banking infrastructure .PERIOD 
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure ,COMMA they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers ,COMMA because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts .PERIOD 
There's a second thing I like about this .PERIOD 
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal ,COMMA and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication ,COMMA I know I could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this .PERIOD OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
And ,COMMA yes ,COMMA there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending .PERIOD 
This is just street-up innovation .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us .PERIOD 
They'll give you a new one .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA that's buy three ,COMMA get one free .PERIOD That kind of thing .PERIOD 
If you go on the streets of India and China ,COMMA you see this kind of stuff .PERIOD 
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks ,COMMA and they fix it ,COMMA and they put it back into circulation .PERIOD 
This is from a workbench in Jilin City ,COMMA in China ,COMMA and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together .PERIOD 
They reverse-engineer manuals .PERIOD 
This is a kind of hacker's manual ,COMMA and it's written in Chinese and English .PERIOD 
They also write them in Hindi .PERIOD 
You can subscribe to these .PERIOD 
There are training institutes where they're churning out people for fixing these things as well .PERIOD 
But what I like about this is ,COMMA it boils down to someone on the street with a small ,COMMA flat surface ,COMMA a screwdriver ,COMMA a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -DASH -DASH because they often get dust on the contact heads -DASH -DASH and knowledge .PERIOD 
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge ,COMMA floating around .PERIOD 
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff ,COMMA and build stuff ,COMMA and potentially distribute stuff .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA for me the street just raises so many different questions .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China .PERIOD 
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes .PERIOD 
And I know what you're asking -DASH -DASH did I test it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm not going to answer that ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
But I look at something like this ,COMMA and I consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process .PERIOD 
And we look at this and we think ,COMMA well ,COMMA how does that apply ,COMMA for example ,COMMA for the design of -DASH -DASH the lessons from this -DASH -DASH apply to the design of online services ,COMMA future services in these markets ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a pair of underpants from -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH from Tibet .PERIOD 
And I look at something like this ,COMMA and honestly ,COMMA you know ,COMMA why would someone design underpants with a pocket ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I look at something like this and it makes me question ,COMMA if we were to take all the functionality in things like this ,COMMA and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network ,COMMA how would we prioritize where to put stuff ?QUESTIONMARK 
And yes ,COMMA this is quite trivial ,COMMA but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks .PERIOD 
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural Uganda .PERIOD 
This doesn't have house numbers .PERIOD This has phone numbers .PERIOD 
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile ?QUESTIONMARK 
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile ,COMMA it isn't fixed ?QUESTIONMARK 
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already ,COMMA OK ,COMMA for those extra three billion people .PERIOD 
And then I go to this picture here ,COMMA which is the one that I started with .PERIOD 
And this is from Delhi .PERIOD 
It's from a study we did into illiteracy ,COMMA and it's a guy in a teashop .PERIOD 
You can see the chai being poured in the background .PERIOD 
And he's a ,COMMA you know ,COMMA incredibly poor teashop worker ,COMMA on the lowest rungs in the society .PERIOD 
And he ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA has the appreciation of the values of Livestrong .PERIOD 
And it's not necessarily the same values ,COMMA but some kind of values of Livestrong ,COMMA to actually go out and purchase them ,COMMA and actually display them .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA this kind of personifies this connected world ,COMMA where everything is intertwined ,COMMA and the dots are -DASH -DASH it's all about the dots joining together .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA the title of this presentation is Connections and Consequences ,COMMA and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
When everyone's connected .PERIOD 
And there are four things .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the first thing is the immediacy of ideas ,COMMA the speed at which ideas go around .PERIOD 
And I know TED is about big ideas ,COMMA but actually ,COMMA the benchmark for a big idea is changing .PERIOD 
If you want a big idea ,COMMA you need to embrace everyone on the planet ,COMMA that's the first thing .PERIOD 
The second thing is the immediacy of objects .PERIOD 
And what I mean by that is ,COMMA as these become smaller ,COMMA as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -DASH -DASH things like banking ,COMMA identity -DASH -DASH these things quite simply move very quickly around the world .PERIOD 
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid ,COMMA in a way that we just totally cannot conceive ,COMMA when you get it to <NUM> billion and the growth in the world's population .PERIOD 
The next thing is that ,COMMA however we design this stuff -DASH -DASH carefully design this stuff -DASH -DASH the street will take it ,COMMA and will figure out ways to innovate ,COMMA as long as it meets base needs -DASH -DASH the ability to transcend space and time ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate .PERIOD 
In ways that ,COMMA despite our resources ,COMMA they can do it better than us .PERIOD 
That's my feeling .PERIOD 
And if we're smart ,COMMA we'll look at this stuff that's going on ,COMMA and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design .PERIOD 
And the last thing is that -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA the direction of the conversation .PERIOD 
With another three billion people connected ,COMMA they want to be part of the conversation .PERIOD 
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen ,COMMA essentially .PERIOD 
And we need to learn how to listen .PERIOD 
So thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD 
One way to change our genes is to make new ones ,COMMA as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown .PERIOD 
Another is to change our lifestyles .PERIOD 
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be ,COMMA that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits .PERIOD 
When you eat healthier ,COMMA manage stress ,COMMA exercise and love more ,COMMA your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .PERIOD 
But more than that ,COMMA your brain gets measurably bigger .PERIOD 
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .PERIOD 
This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there's some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells .PERIOD 
Some of my favorite things ,COMMA like chocolate and tea ,COMMA blueberries ,COMMA alcohol in moderation ,COMMA stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .PERIOD 
What were we just talking about ?QUESTIONMARK 
And other things that can make it worse ,COMMA that can cause you to lose brain cells .PERIOD 
The usual suspects ,COMMA like saturated fat and sugar ,COMMA nicotine ,COMMA opiates ,COMMA cocaine ,COMMA too much alcohol and chronic stress .PERIOD 
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle ,COMMA so you age less quickly .PERIOD Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much .PERIOD 
Your heart gets more blood flow .PERIOD 
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .PERIOD 
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left ,COMMA after only a year become measurably less clogged .PERIOD 
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left ,COMMA the blue means no blood flow .PERIOD 
A year later -DASH -DASH orange and white is maximum blood flow .PERIOD 
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and ,COMMA by extension ,COMMA breast cancer ,COMMA simply by making these changes .PERIOD 
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited <NUM> percent in the group that made these changes ,COMMA whereas only nine percent in the comparison group .PERIOD 
These differences were highly significant .PERIOD 
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow ,COMMA so you increase sexual potency .PERIOD 
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services ,COMMA showing that nicotine ,COMMA which constricts your arteries ,COMMA can cause a heart attack or a stroke ,COMMA but it also causes impotence .PERIOD 
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .PERIOD 
How sexy is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now we're also about to publish a study -DASH -DASH the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .PERIOD 
This is what's called a heat map -DASH -DASH and the different colors -DASH -DASH and along the side ,COMMA on the right ,COMMA are different genes .PERIOD 
And we found that over <NUM> genes were favorably changed -DASH -DASH in effect ,COMMA turning on the good genes ,COMMA the disease-preventing genes ,COMMA turning off the disease-promoting genes .PERIOD 
And so these findings I think are really very powerful ,COMMA giving many people new hope and new choices .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA our genes are not our fate ,COMMA and if we make these changes -DASH -DASH they're a predisposition -DASH -DASH but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise ,COMMA we can actually change how our genes are expressed .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things :COLON one ,COMMA the rise of a culture of availability ;SEMICOLON and two ,COMMA a request .PERIOD 
So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation ,COMMA globally ,COMMA across all social strata .PERIOD 
We're seeing ,COMMA along with that proliferation of mobile devices ,COMMA an expectation of availability .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA with that ,COMMA comes the third point ,COMMA which is obligation -DASH -DASH and an obligation to that availability .PERIOD 
And the problem is ,COMMA we're still working through ,COMMA from a societal standpoint ,COMMA how we allow people to be available .PERIOD 
There's a significant delta ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA between what we're willing to accept .PERIOD 
Apologies to Hans Rosling -DASH -DASH he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie -DASH -DASH but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint .PERIOD 
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up .PERIOD 
This first one's called the lean .PERIOD 
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting chicken ,COMMA you're sitting there ,COMMA looking at the person ,COMMA waiting for them to look away ,COMMA and then quickly checking the device .PERIOD 
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him .PERIOD 
The stretch .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA the gentleman on the left is saying ,COMMA Screw you ,COMMA I'm going to check my device .PERIOD 
But the guy ,COMMA here ,COMMA on the right ,COMMA he's doing the stretch .PERIOD 
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out ,COMMA the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA my favorite ,COMMA the Love you ;SEMICOLON mean it .PERIOD 
Nothing says I love you like Let me find somebody else I give a damn about .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA this one ,COMMA coming to us from India .PERIOD 
You can find this on YouTube ,COMMA the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging .PERIOD 
Or what we call the sweet gravy ,COMMA stop me before I kill again !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
That is actually the device .PERIOD 
What this is doing is ,COMMA we find a -DASH -DASH a direct collision -DASH -DASH we find a direct collision between availability -DASH -DASH and what's possible through availability -DASH -DASH and a fundamental human need -DASH -DASH which we've been hearing about a lot ,COMMA actually -DASH -DASH the need to create shared narratives .PERIOD 
We're very good at creating personal narratives ,COMMA but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture .PERIOD 
And when you're standing with someone ,COMMA and you're on your mobile device ,COMMA effectively what you're saying to them is ,COMMA You are not as important as ,COMMA literally ,COMMA almost anything that could come to me through this device .PERIOD 
Look around you .PERIOD 
There might be somebody on one right now ,COMMA participating in multi-dimensional engagement .PERIOD 
Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later .PERIOD 
This one I love .PERIOD 
This poor kid ,COMMA clearly a prop -DASH -DASH don't get me wrong ,COMMA a willing prop -DASH -DASH but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks .PERIOD 
This is the sound of one hand clapping .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as we lose the context of our identity ,COMMA it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative ,COMMA becomes the context in which we live .PERIOD 
The stories that we tell -DASH -DASH what we push out -DASH -DASH becomes who we are .PERIOD 
People aren't simply projecting identity ,COMMA they're creating it .PERIOD 
And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room .PERIOD 
We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience ,COMMA which will create the new world .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So that's Johnny Depp ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder .PERIOD 
And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo .PERIOD 
Some of you might know that ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder ,COMMA and he had tattooed on his right shoulder Winona forever .PERIOD 
And then three years later -DASH -DASH which in fairness ,COMMA kind of is forever by Hollywood standards -DASH -DASH they broke up ,COMMA and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done .PERIOD 
And now his shoulder says ,COMMA Wino forever .PERIOD 
So like Johnny Depp ,COMMA and like <NUM> percent of Americans between the ages of <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA I have a tattoo .PERIOD 
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s ,COMMA but I deliberately waited a really long time .PERIOD 
Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were <NUM> or <NUM> or <NUM> and regretted it by the time they were <NUM> .PERIOD 
That didn't happen to me .PERIOD 
I got my tattoo when I was <NUM> ,COMMA and I regretted it instantly .PERIOD 
And by regretted it ,COMMA I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place -DASH -DASH this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side -DASH -DASH and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street .PERIOD 
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares .PERIOD 
And then I went home that night ,COMMA and I had an even larger emotional meltdown ,COMMA which I'll say more about in a minute .PERIOD 
And this was all actually quite shocking to me ,COMMA because prior to this moment ,COMMA I had prided myself on having absolutely no regrets .PERIOD 
I do that hourly .PERIOD 
But I had always felt like ,COMMA look ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I made the best choice I could make given who I was then ,COMMA given the information I had on hand .PERIOD 
I learned a lesson from it .PERIOD 
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now .PERIOD 
And okay ,COMMA I wouldn't change it .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret ,COMMA which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past is an absolute waste of time ,COMMA that we should always look forward and not backward ,COMMA and that one of the noblest and best things we can do is strive to live a life free of regrets .PERIOD 
This idea is nicely captured by this quote :COLON Things without all remedy should be without regard ;SEMICOLON what's done is done .PERIOD 
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first -DASH -DASH something we might all agree to sign onto .. .PERIOD 
until I tell you who said it .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA so this is Lady MacBeth basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss for feeling bad about murdering people .PERIOD 
And as it happens ,COMMA Shakespeare was onto something here ,COMMA as he generally was .PERIOD 
Because the inability to experience regret is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics of sociopaths .PERIOD 
It's also ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage .PERIOD 
So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions .PERIOD 
So if ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you want to live a life free of regret ,COMMA there is an option open to you .PERIOD 
It's called a lobotomy .PERIOD 
But if you want to be fully functional and fully human and fully humane ,COMMA I think you need to learn to live ,COMMA not without regret ,COMMA but with it .PERIOD 
So let's start off by defining some terms .PERIOD 
What is regret ?QUESTIONMARK 
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past .PERIOD 
So in other words ,COMMA regret requires two things .PERIOD 
It requires ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA agency -DASH -DASH we had to make a decision in the first place .PERIOD 
And second of all ,COMMA it requires imagination .PERIOD 
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice ,COMMA and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA the more we have of either of these things -DASH -DASH the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret ,COMMA the more acute that regret will be .PERIOD 
You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by <NUM> .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well because ,COMMA if you miss your flight by three minutes ,COMMA it is painfully easy to imagine that you could have made different decisions that would have led to a better outcome .PERIOD 
I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel .PERIOD 
I should have gone through that yellow light .PERIOD 
These are the classic conditions that create regret .PERIOD 
We feel regret when we think we are responsible for a decision that came out badly ,COMMA but almost came out well .PERIOD 
Now within that framework ,COMMA we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .PERIOD 
This session today is about behavioral economics .PERIOD 
And most of what we know about regret comes to us out of that domain .PERIOD 
We have a vast body of literature on consumer and financial decisions and the regrets associated with them -DASH -DASH buyer's remorse ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
But then finally ,COMMA it occurred to some researchers to step back and say ,COMMA well okay ,COMMA but overall ,COMMA what do we regret most in life ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here's what the answers turn out to look like .PERIOD 
So top six regrets -DASH -DASH the things we regret most in life :COLON Number one by far ,COMMA education .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of all of our regrets pertain to decisions we made about education .PERIOD 
We wish we'd gotten more of it .PERIOD 
We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic .PERIOD 
Others very high on our list of regrets include career ,COMMA romance ,COMMA parenting ,COMMA various decisions and choices about our sense of self and how we spend our leisure time -DASH -DASH or actually more specifically ,COMMA how we fail to spend our leisure time .PERIOD 
The remaining regrets pertain to these things :COLON finance ,COMMA family issues unrelated to romance or parenting ,COMMA health ,COMMA friends ,COMMA spirituality and community .PERIOD 
So in other words ,COMMA we know most of what we know about regret by the study of finance .PERIOD 
But it turns out ,COMMA when you look overall at what people regret in life ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA our financial decisions don't even rank .PERIOD 
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets .PERIOD 
So if you're sitting there stressing about large cap versus small cap ,COMMA or company A versus company B ,COMMA or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA let it go .PERIOD 
But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around ,COMMA what does that experience feel like ?QUESTIONMARK 
We all know the short answer .PERIOD 
But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways .PERIOD 
So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial .PERIOD 
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo ,COMMA I basically stayed up all night .PERIOD 
And for the first several hours ,COMMA there was exactly one thought in my head .PERIOD 
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's right up there with ,COMMA I want my mommy !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
We're not trying to solve the problem .PERIOD 
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about .PERIOD 
The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment .PERIOD 
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was ,COMMA How could I have done that ?QUESTIONMARK 
What was I thinking ?QUESTIONMARK 
This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret .PERIOD 
We can't identify with that part .PERIOD 
We don't understand that part .PERIOD 
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part -DASH -DASH which explains the third consistent component of regret ,COMMA which is an intense desire to punish ourselves .PERIOD 
That's why ,COMMA in the face of our regret ,COMMA the thing we consistently say is ,COMMA I could have kicked myself .PERIOD 
The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative .PERIOD 
To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing .PERIOD 
Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop .PERIOD 
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night ,COMMA thinking ,COMMA Make it go away .PERIOD 
It's that I sat there and I thought ,COMMA Make it go away .PERIOD Make it go away .PERIOD 
So if you look at the psychological literature ,COMMA these are the four consistent defining components of regret .PERIOD 
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one .PERIOD 
And I think of this as a kind of existential wake-up call .PERIOD 
That night in my apartment ,COMMA after I got done kicking myself and so forth ,COMMA I lay in bed for a long time ,COMMA and I thought about skin grafts .PERIOD 
And then I thought about how ,COMMA much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God ,COMMA probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy .PERIOD 
The whole point of acts of idiocy is that they leave you totally uninsured ;SEMICOLON they leave you exposed to the world and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility in face of ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA a fairly indifferent universe .PERIOD 
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience .PERIOD 
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West in the grips of what I sometimes think of as a Control-Z culture -DASH -DASH Control-Z like the computer command ,COMMA undo .PERIOD 
We're incredibly used to not having to face life's hard realities ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD 
We think we can throw money at the problem or throw technology at the problem -DASH -DASH we can undo and unfriend and unfollow .PERIOD 
Sometimes instead of Control-Z ,COMMA we actually have zero control .PERIOD 
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists -DASH -DASH and I know where of I speak -DASH -DASH this is really hard ,COMMA because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right .PERIOD 
Now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos ,COMMA and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes .PERIOD 
So for instance ,COMMA here's one of my favorite automatic generators of regret in modern life .PERIOD 
Text :COLON Relpy to all .PERIOD 
And the amazing thing about this really insidious technological innovation is that even just with this one thing ,COMMA we can experience a huge range of regret .PERIOD 
You can accidentally hit reply all to an email and torpedo a relationship .PERIOD 
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work .PERIOD 
Or you can have your last day at work .PERIOD 
And this doesn't even touch on the really profound regrets of a life .PERIOD 
Because of course ,COMMA sometimes we do make decisions that have irrevocable and terrible consequences ,COMMA either for our own or for other people's health and happiness and livelihoods ,COMMA and in the very worst case scenario ,COMMA even their lives .PERIOD 
Now obviously ,COMMA those kinds of regrets are incredibly piercing and enduring .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA even the stupid reply all regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .PERIOD 
So how are we supposed to live with this ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want to suggest that there's three things that help us to make our peace with regret .PERIOD 
And the first of these is to take some comfort in its universality .PERIOD 
If you Google regret and tattoo ,COMMA you will get <NUM> million hits .PERIOD 
That is Johnny Depp and me and our seven million friends .PERIOD 
And that's just regret about tattoos .PERIOD 
We are all in this together .PERIOD 
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret is to laugh at ourselves .PERIOD 
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion when it comes to these more profound regrets .PERIOD 
I don't think that's the case though .PERIOD 
All of us who've experienced regret that contains real pain and real grief understand that humor and even black humor plays a crucial role in helping us survive .PERIOD 
It connects the poles of our lives back together ,COMMA the positive and the negative ,COMMA and it sends a little current of life back into us .PERIOD 
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time ,COMMA which ,COMMA as we know ,COMMA heals all wounds -DASH -DASH except for tattoos ,COMMA which are permanent .PERIOD 
So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo .PERIOD 
And do you guys just want to see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Actually ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA I should warn you ,COMMA you're going to be disappointed .PERIOD 
Because it's actually not that hideous .PERIOD 
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something .PERIOD 
When other people see my tattoo ,COMMA for the most part they like how it looks .PERIOD 
It's just that I don't like how it looks .PERIOD 
And as I said earlier ,COMMA I'm a perfectionist .PERIOD 
But I'll let you see it anyway .PERIOD 
This is my tattoo .PERIOD 
I can guess what some of you are thinking .PERIOD 
So let me reassure you about something .PERIOD 
Some of your own regrets are also not as ugly as you think they are .PERIOD 
I got this tattoo because I spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling .PERIOD 
And when I came and settled in New York afterward ,COMMA I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time .PERIOD 
Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and ,COMMA simultaneously ,COMMA how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north .PERIOD 
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device .PERIOD 
Well it did .PERIOD 
But it turns out ,COMMA it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would ;SEMICOLON it reminds me constantly of something else instead .PERIOD 
It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us ,COMMA which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us .PERIOD 
And ironically ,COMMA I think it's probably the single most important thing I possibly could have tattooed onto my body -DASH -DASH partly as a writer ,COMMA but also just as a human being .PERIOD 
Here's the thing ,COMMA if we have goals and dreams ,COMMA and we want to do our best ,COMMA and if we love people and we don't want to hurt them or lose them ,COMMA we should feel pain when things go wrong .PERIOD 
The point isn't to live without any regrets .PERIOD 
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them .PERIOD 
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo and that I want to leave you with today is this :COLON We need to learn to love the flawed ,COMMA imperfect things that we create and to forgive ourselves for creating them .PERIOD 
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly .PERIOD 
It reminds us that we know we can do better .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I thought in getting up to my TED wish I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do and how it fits with what they try to do .PERIOD 
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent ,COMMA but insufficient in three major ways .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA profoundly unequal :COLON half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day ;SEMICOLON a billion people with no access to clean water ;SEMICOLON two and a half billion no access to sanitation ;SEMICOLON a billion going to bed hungry every night ;SEMICOLON one in four deaths every year from AIDS ,COMMA TB ,COMMA malaria and the variety of infections associated with dirty water -DASH -DASH <NUM> percent of them under five years of age .PERIOD 
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .PERIOD 
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us -DASH -DASH which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do for a living ,COMMA enjoying this evening -DASH -DASH is profoundly unequal .PERIOD 
Unstable because of the threats of terror ,COMMA weapons of mass destruction ,COMMA the spread of global disease and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago .PERIOD 
And perhaps most important of all ,COMMA it is unsustainable because of climate change ,COMMA resource depletion and species destruction .PERIOD 
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter and the grandchildren I hope to have ,COMMA it is a world that moves away from unequal ,COMMA unstable ,COMMA unsustainable interdependence to integrated communities -DASH -DASH locally ,COMMA nationally and globally -DASH -DASH that share the characteristics of all successful communities :COLON a broadly shared ,COMMA accessible set of opportunities ,COMMA a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise and a genuine sense of belonging .PERIOD 
All easier said than done .PERIOD 
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago ,COMMA I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on <NUM>/<NUM> ,COMMA I think the thing that troubled the British most was that the perpetrators were not invaders ,COMMA but homegrown citizens whose religious and political identities were more important to them than the people they grew up with ,COMMA went to school with ,COMMA worked with ,COMMA shared weekends with ,COMMA shared meals with .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA they thought their differences were more important than their common humanity .PERIOD 
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century .PERIOD 
Into this mix ,COMMA people like us ,COMMA who are not in public office ,COMMA have more power to do good than at any time in history ,COMMA because more than half the world's people live under governments they voted in and can vote out .PERIOD 
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion .PERIOD 
When the tsunami hit South Asia ,COMMA the United States contributed <NUM> billion dollars .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of our households gave .PERIOD 
Half of them gave over the Internet .PERIOD 
The median contribution was somewhere around <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
And thirdly ,COMMA because of the rise of non-governmental organizations .PERIOD 
They ,COMMA businesses ,COMMA other citizens' groups ,COMMA have enormous power to affect the lives of our fellow human beings .PERIOD 
When I became president in <NUM> ,COMMA there were none of these organizations in Russia .PERIOD 
There are now a couple of hundred thousand .PERIOD 
None in India .PERIOD There are now at least a half a million active .PERIOD 
None in China .PERIOD There are now <NUM> registered with the government ,COMMA probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons .PERIOD 
When I organized my foundation ,COMMA and I thought about the world as it is and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation ,COMMA and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life that I could still have an impact on .PERIOD 
I wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty ,COMMA fight disease ,COMMA combat climate change ,COMMA bridge the religious ,COMMA racial and other divides that torment the world ,COMMA but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more .PERIOD 
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort ,COMMA and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight ,COMMA Ira Magaziner ,COMMA is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done .PERIOD 
He's over there .PERIOD 
If you bought them in vast bulks ,COMMA you could get them at a little under <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
The first country we went to work in ,COMMA the Bahamas ,COMMA was paying <NUM> dollars for these drugs .PERIOD 
The market was so terribly disorganized that they were buying this medicine through two agents who were gigging them sevenfold .PERIOD 
So the very first week we were working ,COMMA we got the price down to <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden ,COMMA they could save seven times as many lives for the same amount of money .PERIOD 
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines ,COMMA one of whom was cited in the film ,COMMA and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy ,COMMA because even at <NUM> dollars ,COMMA these drugs were being sold on a high-margin ,COMMA low-volume ,COMMA uncertain-payment basis .PERIOD 
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations and the supply chain ,COMMA and went to a low-margin ,COMMA high-volume ,COMMA absolutely certain-payment business .PERIOD 
I joked that the main contribution we made to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy .PERIOD 
But the price went to <NUM> dollars from <NUM> .PERIOD 
And pretty soon ,COMMA the average price was <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
Now we can get it for about <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
Children's medicine was <NUM> dollars ,COMMA because nobody could afford to buy any of it .PERIOD 
We negotiated it down to <NUM> .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called UNITAID ,COMMA got a bunch of other countries to help .PERIOD 
That children's medicine is now <NUM> dollars a person a year .PERIOD 
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose ,COMMA treat and care for people and deliver this medicine .PERIOD 
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America .PERIOD 
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools .PERIOD 
We just reorganized the markets .PERIOD 
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world ,COMMA somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .PERIOD 
And that is now what we're trying to do ,COMMA and working with this large cities group to fight climate change ,COMMA to negotiate huge ,COMMA big ,COMMA volume deals that will enable cities which generate <NUM> percent of the world's greenhouse gases ,COMMA to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is good economics .PERIOD 
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden ,COMMA is a mystery to me .PERIOD 
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground .PERIOD 
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar for the Inconvenient Truth movie ,COMMA I was thrilled ,COMMA but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly .PERIOD 
For those of you who saw An Inconvenient Truth ,COMMA the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one ,COMMA which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going if we don't do anything ,COMMA here's where they could go .PERIOD 
And then there are six different categories of things we can do to change the trajectory .PERIOD 
So we're trying to do that .PERIOD 
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do .PERIOD 
Now we have taken on a second thing ,COMMA and this gets to my wish .PERIOD 
It has been my experience in working in developing countries that while the headlines may all be -DASH -DASH the pessimistic headlines may say ,COMMA well ,COMMA we can't do this ,COMMA that or the other thing because of corruption -DASH -DASH I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption ,COMMA and feeds corruption .PERIOD 
We now have the money ,COMMA given these low prices ,COMMA to distribute AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach .PERIOD 
Today these low prices are available in the <NUM> countries where we work ,COMMA and in a total of <NUM> countries ,COMMA and about <NUM> people are getting the benefits of them .PERIOD 
But the money is there to reach others .PERIOD 
The systems are not there to reach the people .PERIOD 
So what we have been trying to do ,COMMA working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places -DASH -DASH but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight -DASH -DASH is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with AIDS ,COMMA TB ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA other infectious diseases ,COMMA maternal and child health ,COMMA and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world ,COMMA that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda ,COMMA and then will be a model that could literally be implemented in any other poor country in the world .PERIOD 
And the test is :COLON one ,COMMA will it do the job ?QUESTIONMARK 
Will it provide high quality care ?QUESTIONMARK 
And two ,COMMA will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because the longer I deal with these problems ,COMMA the more convinced I am that we have to -DASH -DASH whether it's economics ,COMMA health ,COMMA education ,COMMA whatever -DASH -DASH we have to build systems .PERIOD 
And the absence of systems that function break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight .PERIOD 
In a world with no systems ,COMMA with chaos ,COMMA everything becomes a guerilla struggle ,COMMA and this predictability is not there .PERIOD 
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives ,COMMA educate kids ,COMMA develop economies ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
The person ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA who has done the best job of this in the health care area ,COMMA of building a system in a very poor area ,COMMA is Dr .PERIOD Paul Farmer ,COMMA who ,COMMA many of you know ,COMMA has worked for now <NUM> years with his group ,COMMA Partners in Health ,COMMA primarily in Haiti where he started ,COMMA but they've also worked in Russia ,COMMA in Peru and other places around the world .PERIOD 
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results .PERIOD 
So when we decided to work in Rwanda on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem ,COMMA we wanted to build a healthcare network ,COMMA because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in <NUM> ,COMMA and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day .PERIOD 
So I rang up ,COMMA asked Paul Farmer if he would help .PERIOD 
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country ,COMMA number one ,COMMA it would be a wonderful thing for a country that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA and number two ,COMMA we would have something that could then be adapted to any other poor country anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
And so we have set about doing that .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we started working together <NUM> months ago .PERIOD 
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza ,COMMA which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda ,COMMA with a group that originally includes about <NUM> people .PERIOD 
Recently we did an evaluation of the first <NUM> months of our efforts in Rwanda .PERIOD 
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do .PERIOD 
We have about <NUM> people around the world working in our AIDS program ,COMMA some of them for nothing -DASH -DASH just for transportation ,COMMA room and board .PERIOD 
Our business plan in Rwanda was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble ,COMMA who is an unusually gifted woman ,COMMA but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work .PERIOD 
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s .PERIOD 
She was CEO of a successful e-venture -DASH -DASH she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures -DASH -DASH and at <NUM> she decided she wanted to do something different with her life .PERIOD 
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country .PERIOD 
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it .PERIOD 
When we came to this rural area ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of them died before they reached the age of five .PERIOD 
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent .PERIOD 
Over <NUM> percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation -DASH -DASH all entirely preventable and treatable .PERIOD 
Over <NUM> percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses -DASH -DASH again ,COMMA all preventable and treatable .PERIOD 
Within the first <NUM> months ,COMMA the following things happened :COLON we went from zero to about <NUM> people being treated for AIDS .PERIOD 
That's <NUM> percent of the people who need treatment in this area .PERIOD 
That's lower than the figure in the United States .PERIOD 
Less than three-tenths of one percent had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs .PERIOD 
<NUM> pregnant women were brought into counseling and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system .PERIOD 
That's about <NUM> percent of all the pregnancies .PERIOD 
About <NUM> percent of all the people -DASH -DASH I said <NUM> .PERIOD I meant <NUM> .PERIOD 
About <NUM> percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it -DASH -DASH in just <NUM> months ,COMMA up from zero when we started .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program to prevent malnutrition and early death are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow .PERIOD 
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there .PERIOD 
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide that we have renovated along with four other clinics ,COMMA complete with solar power generators ,COMMA good lab technology .PERIOD 
We now are treating <NUM> people a month ,COMMA despite the fact that almost <NUM> percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home .PERIOD 
And the most important thing is because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model ,COMMA using community health workers ,COMMA we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda for between five and six percent of GDP ,COMMA and that the government could sustain that without depending on foreign aid after five or six years .PERIOD 
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and <NUM> percent of GDP on health care ,COMMA except for the United States ,COMMA we spend <NUM> -DASH -DASH but that's a story for another day .PERIOD 
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho .PERIOD 
And we have similar projects in Tanzania ,COMMA Mozambique ,COMMA Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing :COLON to save as many lives as quickly as we can ,COMMA but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world .PERIOD 
But over a five- to 10-year period ,COMMA we will take down the need for outside assistance and eventually it will be phased out .PERIOD 
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build a high-quality rural health system in a poor country ,COMMA Rwanda ,COMMA that can be a model for Africa ,COMMA and indeed ,COMMA for any poor country anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world with more partners and fewer terrorists ,COMMA with more productive citizens and fewer haters ,COMMA a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in .PERIOD 
It has been an honor for me ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA to work in Rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter ,COMMA the Scottish philanthropist ,COMMA where last year we ,COMMA using the same thing with AIDS drugs ,COMMA cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by <NUM> percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers .PERIOD 
These people have been through a lot and none of us ,COMMA most of all me ,COMMA helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other .PERIOD 
We're undoing that now ,COMMA and they are so over it and so into their future .PERIOD 
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way .PERIOD 
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the <NUM> percent of the people that have no access ,COMMA but to do it with clean energy .PERIOD To have responsible reforestation projects ,COMMA the Rwandans ,COMMA interestingly enough ,COMMA have been quite good ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Wilson ,COMMA in preserving their topsoil .PERIOD 
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families -DASH -DASH the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it .PERIOD 
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation ,COMMA reorganize itself ,COMMA focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive ,COMMA quality health care with minimal outside help .PERIOD 
I am grateful for this prize ,COMMA and I will use it to that end .PERIOD 
We could use some more help to do this ,COMMA but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system in Rwanda -DASH -DASH in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income ,COMMA one that could save hundreds of millions of lives over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth .PERIOD 
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed .PERIOD 
Thank you and God bless you .PERIOD 
I grew up in a very small village in Canada ,COMMA and I'm an undiagnosed dyslexic .PERIOD 
I left when I was <NUM> years old to go to Bali ,COMMA and there I met my incredible wife ,COMMA Cynthia ,COMMA and together ,COMMA over <NUM> years ,COMMA we built an amazing jewelry business .PERIOD 
It was a fairy tale ,COMMA and then we retired .PERIOD 
Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see .PERIOD 
It ruined my life -DASH -DASH The Inconvenient Truth and Mr .PERIOD Gore .PERIOD 
I have four kids ,COMMA and even if part of what he says is true ,COMMA they're not going to have the life that I had .PERIOD 
And I decided at that moment that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could to improve their possibilities .PERIOD 
So here's the world ,COMMA and here we are in Bali .PERIOD 
It's a tiny ,COMMA little island -DASH -DASH <NUM> miles by <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
It has an intact Hindu culture .PERIOD 
Cynthia and I were there .PERIOD 
We had had a wonderful life there ,COMMA and we decided to do something unusual .PERIOD 
We decided to give back locally .PERIOD 
And here it is :COLON it's called the Green School .PERIOD 
I know it doesn't look like a school ,COMMA but it is something we decided to do ,COMMA and it is extremely ,COMMA extremely green .PERIOD 
The classrooms have no walls .PERIOD 
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .PERIOD 
The desks are not square .PERIOD 
At Green School ,COMMA the children are smiling -DASH -DASH an unusual thing for school ,COMMA especially for me .PERIOD 
And we practice holism .PERIOD 
And for me it's just the idea that ,COMMA if this little girl graduates as a whole person ,COMMA chances are she'll demand a whole world -DASH -DASH a whole world -DASH -DASH to live on .PERIOD 
Our children spend <NUM> days going to school in a box .PERIOD 
The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials .PERIOD 
So if this gentleman had had a holistic education ,COMMA would he be sitting there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would he have had more possibilities in his life ?QUESTIONMARK 
The classrooms have natural light .PERIOD 
They're beautiful .PERIOD They're bamboo .PERIOD 
The breeze passes through them .PERIOD 
These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree .PERIOD 
So we basically turned the box into a bubble .PERIOD 
And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future .PERIOD 
We pay the bill at the end of the month ,COMMA but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren .PERIOD 
We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible .PERIOD 
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks ,COMMA and then they signed up for two extra courses .PERIOD 
The first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing .PERIOD 
But since that happened ,COMMA they own those desks .PERIOD 
We're on the grid .PERIOD We're not proud of it .PERIOD 
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar .PERIOD 
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world ,COMMA in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river .PERIOD 
When the turbine drops in ,COMMA it will produce <NUM> watts of electricity ,COMMA day and night .PERIOD 
And you know what these are .PERIOD 
There's nowhere to flush .PERIOD 
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -DASH -DASH you're all really smart ,COMMA just do the math .PERIOD 
How many people times how much water .PERIOD 
There isn't enough water .PERIOD 
These are compost toilets ,COMMA and nobody at the school wanted to know about them ,COMMA especially the principal .PERIOD 
And they work .PERIOD People use them .PERIOD People are okay .PERIOD 
It's something you should think about doing .PERIOD 
Not many things didn't work .PERIOD 
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .PERIOD 
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic .PERIOD 
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards into the classrooms .PERIOD 
So we had some good ideas :COLON we took old automobile windshields ,COMMA put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard .PERIOD 
Green School sits in south-central Bali ,COMMA and it's on <NUM> acres of rolling garden .PERIOD 
There's an amazing river traveling through it ,COMMA and you can see there how we manage to get across the river .PERIOD 
I met a father the other day ;SEMICOLON he looked a little crazed .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Welcome to Green School .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA I've been on an airplane for <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
I asked him ,COMMA Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA I had a dream once about a green school ,COMMA and I saw a picture of this green school ,COMMA I got on an airplane .PERIOD 
In August I'm bringing my sons .PERIOD 
This was a great thing .PERIOD 
But more than that ,COMMA people are building green houses around Green School ,COMMA so their kids can walk to school on the paths .PERIOD 
And people are bringing their green industries ,COMMA hopefully their green restaurants ,COMMA to the Green School .PERIOD 
It's becoming a community .PERIOD 
It's becoming a green model .PERIOD 
We had to look at everything .PERIOD 
No petrochemicals in the pavement .PERIOD 
No pavement .PERIOD 
These are volcanic stones laid by hand .PERIOD 
There are no sidewalks .PERIOD 
The sidewalks are gravel .PERIOD They flood when it rains ,COMMA but they're green .PERIOD 
This is the school buffalo .PERIOD 
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner .PERIOD 
All the fences at Green School are green .PERIOD 
And when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate ,COMMA they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .PERIOD 
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen ,COMMA sliced them thinly and made delicious chips .PERIOD 
We manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms .PERIOD 
We dropped them gently in .PERIOD 
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs .PERIOD 
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field .PERIOD 
These young ladies are living in a rice culture ,COMMA but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .PERIOD 
They know how to plant organic rice ,COMMA they know how to look after it ,COMMA they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it .PERIOD 
This young man is picking organic vegetables .PERIOD 
We feed <NUM> people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch .PERIOD There's no gas .PERIOD 
Local Balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know .PERIOD 
And it's a kind of microcosm of the globalized world .PERIOD 
When I see them together ,COMMA I know that they're working out how to live in the future .PERIOD 
Green School is going into its third year with <NUM> children .PERIOD 
It's a school where you do learn reading -DASH -DASH one of my favorites -DASH -DASH writing -DASH -DASH I was bad at it -DASH -DASH arithmetic .PERIOD 
But you also learn other things .PERIOD 
You learn bamboo building .PERIOD 
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields .PERIOD 
The mothers aren't quite convinced .PERIOD 
We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives ,COMMA and we said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA local ,COMMA what does local mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
Local means that <NUM> percent of the population of the school has to be Balinese ,COMMA and this was a really big commitment .PERIOD 
And we were right .PERIOD 
And people are coming forward from all over the world to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund ,COMMA because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders .PERIOD 
The teachers are as diverse as the student body ,COMMA and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up .PERIOD 
A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture .PERIOD 
A woman came from Africa with music .PERIOD 
We need someone to come and study it .PERIOD 
But what's happening ,COMMA our learning-different kids -DASH -DASH dyslexic -DASH -DASH we've renamed them prolexic -DASH -DASH are doing well in these beautiful ,COMMA beautiful classrooms .PERIOD 
And all the kids are thriving .PERIOD 
On giant grass .PERIOD 
It's bamboo .PERIOD 
It comes out of the ground like a train .PERIOD 
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this .PERIOD 
It's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up any roof .PERIOD 
When the architects came ,COMMA they brought us these things ,COMMA and you've probably seen things like this .PERIOD 
The yellow box was called the administration complex .PERIOD 
We squashed it ,COMMA we rethought it ,COMMA but mainly we renamed it the heart of school ,COMMA and that changed everything forever .PERIOD 
It has administrators in it and many ,COMMA many other things .PERIOD 
And the problem of building it -DASH -DASH when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans ,COMMA they looked at them and said ,COMMA What's this ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we built big models .PERIOD 
We had them engineered by the engineers .PERIOD 
And Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers ,COMMA selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques ,COMMA mostly by hand .PERIOD 
It was chaos .PERIOD 
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do ,COMMA so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down ,COMMA we realized that we had a cathedral ,COMMA a cathedral to green ,COMMA and a cathedral to green education .PERIOD 
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it .PERIOD 
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world ,COMMA but many people believe that it's the most beautiful .PERIOD 
Is this doable in your community ?QUESTIONMARK 
We believe it is .PERIOD 
Green School is a model we built for the world .PERIOD 
It's a model we built for Bali .PERIOD 
And you just have to follow these simple ,COMMA simple rules :COLON be local ,COMMA let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Gore ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
And if you're interested in being involved in finishing Green School and building the next <NUM> around the world ,COMMA please come and see us .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Roger Ebert :COLON These are my words ,COMMA but this is not my voice .PERIOD 
This is Alex ,COMMA the best computer voice I've been able to find ,COMMA which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh .PERIOD 
For most of my life ,COMMA I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak .PERIOD 
It was like breathing .PERIOD 
In those days ,COMMA I was living in a fool's paradise .PERIOD 
After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak ,COMMA eat or drink ,COMMA I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me .PERIOD 
For several days now ,COMMA we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED .PERIOD 
I used to be able to talk like that .PERIOD 
Maybe I wasn't as smart ,COMMA but I was at least as talkative .PERIOD 
I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself ,COMMA and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA I've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous .PERIOD 
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me .PERIOD 
I will start with my wife ,COMMA Chaz .PERIOD 
Chaz Ebert :COLON It was Chaz who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak .PERIOD 
Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in <NUM> ,COMMA I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show ,COMMA 'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.' I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation .PERIOD 
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw .PERIOD 
My tongue ,COMMA larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected .PERIOD 
I was optimistic ,COMMA and all was right with the world .PERIOD 
The first surgery was a great success .PERIOD 
I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good .PERIOD 
Two weeks later ,COMMA I was ready to return home .PERIOD 
I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song 'I'm Your Man' for my doctors and nurses .PERIOD 
Suddenly ,COMMA I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding .PERIOD 
My carotid artery had ruptured .PERIOD 
Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there .PERIOD 
Chaz told me that if that song hadn't played for so long ,COMMA I might have already been in the car ,COMMA on the way home ,COMMA and would have died right there and then .PERIOD 
So thank you ,COMMA Leonard Cohen ,COMMA for saving my life .PERIOD 
There was a second surgery -DASH -DASH which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart .PERIOD 
A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture .PERIOD 
And before I left the hospital ,COMMA after a year of being hospitalized ,COMMA I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .PERIOD 
There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again ;SEMICOLON it just sort of became obvious .PERIOD 
Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system .PERIOD 
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air .PERIOD 
Because I had lost my jaw ,COMMA I could no longer form a seal ,COMMA and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless .PERIOD 
Dean Ornish :COLON At first for a long time ,COMMA I wrote messages in notebooks .PERIOD 
Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .PERIOD 
This was faster ,COMMA and nobody had to try to read my handwriting .PERIOD 
It was the clearest I could find .PERIOD 
Then Apple released the Alex voice ,COMMA which was the best I'd heard .PERIOD 
It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark .PERIOD 
When it saw a period ,COMMA it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA they share a fundamental problem :COLON they're too slow .PERIOD 
When I find myself in a conversational situation ,COMMA I need to type fast and to jump right in .PERIOD 
People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase .PERIOD 
How does that affect who you are as a person ?QUESTIONMARK 
When people hear Alex speaking my words ,COMMA do they experience a disconnect ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next ?QUESTIONMARK 
How did I feel not being able to speak ?QUESTIONMARK 
I felt ,COMMA and I still feel ,COMMA a lot of distance from the human mainstream .PERIOD 
I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop .PERIOD 
Even then ,COMMA I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties .PERIOD 
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of <NUM> years .PERIOD 
At first I was against it .PERIOD 
I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer .PERIOD 
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own .PERIOD 
But I decided then to just give it a try .PERIOD 
So we contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices .PERIOD 
They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials .PERIOD 
All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth .PERIOD 
But they were willing to give it a try .PERIOD 
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice ,COMMA including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs .PERIOD 
And it sounded like me ,COMMA it really did .PERIOD 
There was a reason for that ;SEMICOLON it was me .PERIOD 
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved -DASH -DASH movie soundtracks ,COMMA for example ,COMMA or Gene Siskel arguing with me -DASH -DASH and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough .PERIOD 
I'll let you hear a sample of that voice .PERIOD 
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program .PERIOD 
And here's the voice we call Roger Jr .PERIOD 
Roger <NUM> :COLON Oprah ,COMMA I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show .PERIOD 
We have been talking for a long time ,COMMA and now here we are again .PERIOD 
It still needs improvement ,COMMA but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL <NUM> .PERIOD 
When I heard it the first time ,COMMA it sent chills down my spine .PERIOD 
When I type anything ,COMMA this voice will speak whatever I type .PERIOD 
I have typed these words in advance ,COMMA as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing .PERIOD 
It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on Casablanca and Citizen Kane .PERIOD 
This is the first voice they've created for an individual .PERIOD 
There are several very good voices available for computers ,COMMA but they all sound like somebody else ,COMMA while this voice sounds like me .PERIOD 
Many blind people use them to read pages on the Web to themselves .PERIOD 
But I've got to say ,COMMA in first grade ,COMMA they said I talked too much ,COMMA and now I still can .PERIOD 
Roger Ebert :COLON As you can hear ,COMMA it sounds like me ,COMMA but the words jump up and down .PERIOD 
The flow isn't natural .PERIOD 
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice ,COMMA and I'm optimistic about it .PERIOD 
But so far ,COMMA the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard .PERIOD 
I wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex .PERIOD 
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice .PERIOD 
A very large sample is needed .PERIOD 
Now I have spoken my last words ,COMMA and I don't even remember for sure what they were .PERIOD 
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream .PERIOD 
On Wednesday ,COMMA David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe .PERIOD 
For almost all of its millions and billions of years ,COMMA there was no life on Earth at all .PERIOD 
For almost all the years of life on Earth ,COMMA there was no intelligent life .PERIOD 
Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next ,COMMA did civilization become possible .PERIOD 
In cosmological terms ,COMMA that was about <NUM> minutes ago .PERIOD 
Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool ,COMMA the computer .PERIOD 
That has mostly happened in my lifetime .PERIOD 
Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana ,COMMA the birthplace of HAL <NUM> .PERIOD 
When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday ,COMMA about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world ,COMMA I had a flashback .PERIOD 
It was about <NUM> .PERIOD 
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school ,COMMA I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called PLATO .PERIOD 
The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations .PERIOD 
This was a computer-assisted instruction system ,COMMA which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC .PERIOD 
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning .PERIOD 
The point is PLATO was only <NUM> years ago ,COMMA an instant in time .PERIOD 
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers ,COMMA until only five years ago .PERIOD 
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana ,COMMA it appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual ,COMMA online universe we occupy today .PERIOD 
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce .PERIOD 
I'm here as a man who wants to communicate .PERIOD 
All of this has happened in my lifetime .PERIOD 
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first Atech systems was installed at the Chicago Sun-Times .PERIOD 
I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model <NUM>'s .PERIOD 
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections ,COMMA they didn't know what I was talking about .PERIOD 
When I bought my first desktop ,COMMA it was a DEC Rainbow .PERIOD 
Does anybody remember that ?QUESTIONMARK 
The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the Porteram Telebubble .PERIOD 
I joined CompuServe when it had fewer numbers than I currently have followers on Twitter .PERIOD 
All of this has happened in the blink of an eye .PERIOD 
It is unimaginable what will happen next .PERIOD 
It makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history .PERIOD 
Indeed ,COMMA I am lucky to live in history at all ,COMMA because without intelligence and memory there is no history .PERIOD 
For billions of years ,COMMA the universe evolved completely without notice .PERIOD 
Now we live in the age of the Internet ,COMMA which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .PERIOD 
And because of it ,COMMA I can communicate as well as I ever could .PERIOD 
We are born into a box of time and space .PERIOD 
We use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA the Internet began as a useful tool and now has become something I rely on for my actual daily existence .PERIOD 
I cannot speak ;SEMICOLON I can only type so fast .PERIOD 
Computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated ,COMMA but with my computer ,COMMA I can communicate more widely than ever before .PERIOD 
I feel as if my blog ,COMMA my email ,COMMA Twitter and Facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation .PERIOD 
They aren't an improvement ,COMMA but they're the best I can do .PERIOD 
They give me a way to speak .PERIOD 
Not everybody has the patience of my wife ,COMMA Chaz .PERIOD 
This whole adventure has been a learning experience .PERIOD 
Every time there was a surgery that failed ,COMMA I was left with a little less flesh and bone .PERIOD 
Now I have no jaw left at all .PERIOD 
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders ,COMMA the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily .PERIOD 
But no you don't .PERIOD 
It is human nature to look at someone like me and assume I have lost some of my marbles .PERIOD 
People -DASH -DASH People talk loudly -DASH -DASH I'm so sorry .PERIOD 
Excuse me .PERIOD 
People talk loudly and slowly to me .PERIOD 
Sometimes they assume I am deaf .PERIOD 
There are people who don't want to make eye contact .PERIOD 
Believe me ,COMMA he didn't mean this as -DASH -DASH anyway ,COMMA let me just read it .PERIOD 
You should never let your wife read something like this .PERIOD 
It is human nature to look away from illness .PERIOD 
We don't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality .PERIOD 
That's why writing on the Internet has become a lifesaver for me .PERIOD 
My ability to think and write have not been affected .PERIOD 
And on the Web ,COMMA my real voice finds expression .PERIOD 
I have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way .PERIOD 
One of my Twitter friends can type only with his toes .PERIOD 
One of the funniest blogs on the Web is written by a friend of mine named Smartass Cripple .PERIOD 
Google him and he will make you laugh .PERIOD 
All of these people are saying ,COMMA in one way or another ,COMMA that what you see is not all you get .PERIOD 
So I have not come here to complain .PERIOD 
I have much to make me happy and relieved .PERIOD 
I seem ,COMMA for the time being ,COMMA to be cancer-free .PERIOD 
I am writing as well as ever .PERIOD 
I am productive .PERIOD 
If I were in this condition at any point before a few cosmological instants ago ,COMMA I would be as isolated as a hermit .PERIOD 
I would be trapped inside my head .PERIOD 
Because of the rush of human knowledge ,COMMA because of the digital revolution ,COMMA I have a voice ,COMMA and I do not need to scream .PERIOD 
Wait .PERIOD I have one more thing to add .PERIOD 
A guy goes into a psychiatrist .PERIOD 
The psychiatrist says ,COMMA You're crazy .PERIOD 
The guy says ,COMMA I want a second opinion .PERIOD 
The psychiatrist says ,COMMA All right ,COMMA you're ugly .PERIOD 
You all know the test for artificial intelligence -DASH -DASH the Turing test .PERIOD 
A human judge has a conversation with a human and a computer .PERIOD 
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human ,COMMA the machine has passed the test .PERIOD 
I now propose a test for computer voices -DASH -DASH the Ebert test .PERIOD 
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman ,COMMA then that's the voice I want .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother ,COMMA whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles ,COMMA especially for me when I was an activist ,COMMA and being harassed by the police .PERIOD 
You will recall that in <NUM> ,COMMA June <NUM> ,COMMA the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor ,COMMA as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans -DASH -DASH biology ,COMMA mathematics -DASH -DASH and what about our languages ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the students wanted to speak to the government ,COMMA and police answered with bullets .PERIOD 
So every year ,COMMA June <NUM> ,COMMA we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .PERIOD 
And I was very young then .PERIOD I think I was <NUM> years ,COMMA and I started asking questions ,COMMA and that’s when my political education started .PERIOD 
And I joined ,COMMA later on ,COMMA the youth organization under the African National Congress .PERIOD 
So as part of organizing this and whatever ,COMMA this commemoration ,COMMA the police will round us up as they call us leaders .PERIOD 
And I used to run away from home ,COMMA when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so .PERIOD 
And my grandmother one time said ,COMMA No ,COMMA look ,COMMA you’re not going to run away .PERIOD 
This is your place ,COMMA you stay here .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA the police came -DASH -DASH because they’ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like ,COMMA after the 20th or so .PERIOD 
So it was on the 10th of June ,COMMA and they came ,COMMA and they surrounded the house ,COMMA and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house ,COMMA and opened the kitchen door .PERIOD 
And she said to them ,COMMA Vusi's here ,COMMA and you're not going to take him tonight .PERIOD 
I'm tired of you having to come here ,COMMA harassing us ,COMMA while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .PERIOD 
He is here ,COMMA and you're not going to take him .PERIOD 
I've got a bowl full of boiling water -DASH -DASH the first one who comes in here ,COMMA gets it .PERIOD 
And they left .PERIOD 
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news ,COMMA and advertisers follow them .PERIOD 
Your iPhone ,COMMA your laptop ,COMMA is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday .PERIOD 
And we should save trees in the end .PERIOD 
So it's enough to bury any industry .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA should we rather ask ,COMMA Can anything save newspapers ?QUESTIONMARK 
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper .PERIOD 
Some people say it should be free ;SEMICOLON it should be tabloid ,COMMA or even smaller :COLON A4 ;SEMICOLON it should be local ,COMMA run by communities ,COMMA or niche ,COMMA for some smaller groups like business -DASH -DASH but then it's not free ;SEMICOLON it's very expensive .PERIOD 
It should be opinion-driven ;SEMICOLON less news ,COMMA more views .PERIOD 
And we'd rather read it during breakfast ,COMMA because later we listen to radio in a car ,COMMA check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV .PERIOD 
Sounds nice ,COMMA but this can only buy time .PERIOD 
Because in the long run ,COMMA I think there is no reason ,COMMA no practical reason for newspapers to survive .PERIOD 
So what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA Bonnier ,COMMA Swedish publisher ,COMMA started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc .PERIOD 
After a few years ,COMMA they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe .PERIOD 
They were run by an inexperienced staff ,COMMA with no visual culture ,COMMA no budgets for visuals -DASH -DASH in many places there were not even art directors .PERIOD 
I decided to be -DASH -DASH to work for them as an art director .PERIOD 
Before ,COMMA I was an architect ,COMMA and my grandmother asked me once ,COMMA What are you doing for a living ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA I'm designing newspapers .PERIOD 
What ?QUESTIONMARK There's nothing to design there .PERIOD It's just boring letters And she was right .PERIOD I was very frustrated ,COMMA until one day .PERIOD 
And I had a revelation .PERIOD I thought ,COMMA These guys took some creepy ,COMMA run-down entertainment ,COMMA and put it to the highest possible level of performance art .PERIOD 
I thought Oh my God ,COMMA maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers .PERIOD 
And I did .PERIOD We started to redesign them ,COMMA one by one .PERIOD 
The front page became our signature .PERIOD 
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers .PERIOD 
I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation .PERIOD 
My approach was very egotistic .PERIOD 
I wanted to make posters ,COMMA not newspapers .PERIOD 
Not even magazines :COLON posters .PERIOD 
We were experimenting with type ,COMMA with illustration ,COMMA with photos .PERIOD And we had fun .PERIOD 
Soon it started to bring results .PERIOD 
In Poland ,COMMA our pages were named Covers of the Year three times in a row .PERIOD 
Other examples you can see here are from Latvia ,COMMA Lithuania ,COMMA Estonia -DASH -DASH the central European countries .PERIOD 
But it's not only about the front page .PERIOD 
And music has a rhythm ,COMMA has ups and downs .PERIOD 
Flipping through pages is readers experience ,COMMA and I'm responsible for this experience .PERIOD 
We treated two pages ,COMMA both spreads ,COMMA as a one page ,COMMA because that's how readers perceive it .PERIOD 
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on biggest infographic competition in Spain .PERIOD 
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design .PERIOD 
Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland ,COMMA they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper .PERIOD 
And two years later ,COMMA the same award came to Estonia .PERIOD 
Isn't amazing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Just some examples :COLON in Russia ,COMMA plus <NUM> after one year ,COMMA plus <NUM> after three years of the redesign .PERIOD 
You can see on a graph ,COMMA after years of stagnation ,COMMA the paper started to grow ,COMMA just after redesign .PERIOD 
But the real hit was in Bulgaria .PERIOD 
And that is really amazing .PERIOD 
Did design do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Design was just a part of the process .PERIOD 
And the process we made was not about changing the look ,COMMA it was about improving the product completely .PERIOD 
I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design .PERIOD 
And I put strategy at the top of it .PERIOD 
So first you ask a big question :COLON why we do it ?QUESTIONMARK What is the goal ?QUESTIONMARK 
Then we adjust the content accordingly .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA usually after two months ,COMMA we start designing .PERIOD 
My bosses ,COMMA in the beginning ,COMMA were very surprised .PERIOD 
Why am I asking all of these business questions ,COMMA instead of just showing them pages ?QUESTIONMARK 
But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer :COLON to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end .PERIOD 
So what is the lesson behind it ?QUESTIONMARK 
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product .PERIOD 
It can change your workflow -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA it can change everything in your company ;SEMICOLON it can turn your company upside down .PERIOD 
It can even change you .PERIOD 
And who's responsible ?QUESTIONMARK Designers .PERIOD 
Give power to designers .PERIOD 
But the second is even more important .PERIOD 
You can live in a small poor country ,COMMA like me .PERIOD 
You can have no budgets ,COMMA no people -DASH -DASH but still can put your work to the highest possible level .PERIOD 
And everybody can do it .PERIOD 
You just need inspiration ,COMMA vision and determination .PERIOD 
And you need to remember that to be good is not enough .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than <NUM> years .PERIOD 
When I was <NUM> years old ,COMMA I came home from work ,COMMA put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run .PERIOD 
I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever .PERIOD 
While I was preparing my dog for the run ,COMMA a man was finishing drinking at a bar ,COMMA picked up his car keys ,COMMA got into a car and headed south ,COMMA or wherever he was .PERIOD 
What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog .PERIOD 
She ended up underneath the car .PERIOD 
I flew out in front of the car ,COMMA and then he ran over my legs .PERIOD 
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -DASH -DASH spun it around .PERIOD 
The bumper of the car hit my throat ,COMMA slicing it open .PERIOD 
I ended up with blunt chest trauma .PERIOD 
Your aorta comes up behind your heart .PERIOD 
It's your major artery ,COMMA and it was severed ,COMMA so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth .PERIOD 
It foamed ,COMMA and horrible things were happening to me .PERIOD 
I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it .PERIOD 
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there .PERIOD 
And my lung collapsed ,COMMA so somebody cut me open and put a pin in there as well to stop that catastrophic event from happening .PERIOD 
Somehow I ended up at the hospital .PERIOD 
I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma .PERIOD 
<NUM> months later I woke up .PERIOD 
I was blind ,COMMA I couldn't speak ,COMMA and I couldn't walk .PERIOD 
I was <NUM> lbs .PERIOD 
The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA they started to call me a Gomer .PERIOD 
That's another story we won't even get into .PERIOD 
I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together ,COMMA to repair my heart a few times .PERIOD 
Some things worked ,COMMA some things didn't .PERIOD 
And I ended up with a plastic nose ,COMMA porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things .PERIOD 
But eventually I started to look human again .PERIOD 
But it's hard sometimes to talk about these things ,COMMA so bear with me .PERIOD 
I had more than <NUM> surgeries .PERIOD 
But who's counting ?QUESTIONMARK 
So eventually ,COMMA the hospital decided it was time for me to go .PERIOD 
They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through .PERIOD 
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover .PERIOD 
So they basically put a map up on the wall ,COMMA threw a dart ,COMMA and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado .PERIOD 
And I know all of you are scratching your head :COLON A senior citizens' home ?QUESTIONMARK What in the world are you going to do there ?QUESTIONMARK 
But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now ,COMMA that's what a senior home has .PERIOD 
So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had .PERIOD 
The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom ,COMMA because they had a long life .PERIOD 
But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep ?QUESTIONMARK 
At that point ,COMMA I had gained four pounds ,COMMA so I was <NUM> lbs .PERIOD 
I was bald .PERIOD 
I was wearing hospital scrubs .PERIOD 
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me .PERIOD 
And I had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand .PERIOD 
And so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting .PERIOD 
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other ,COMMA and they were going ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA what skills do we have in this room ?QUESTIONMARK 
This kid needs a lot of work .PERIOD 
But one of the first things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away .PERIOD 
I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being ,COMMA since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins .PERIOD 
So I had to go through trying to eat again .PERIOD 
And they went through that process .PERIOD 
And then they had to figure out :COLON Well she needs furniture .PERIOD 
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment .PERIOD 
So they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture -DASH -DASH gave me pots and pans ,COMMA blankets ,COMMA everything .PERIOD 
And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover .PERIOD 
So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints .PERIOD 
We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back .PERIOD 
But I did say no to the blue hair .PERIOD 
So eventually what went on is they decided that ,COMMA well I need to learn to speak .PERIOD 
So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see .PERIOD 
So while Sally ,COMMA the office manager ,COMMA was teaching me to speak in the day -DASH -DASH it's hard ,COMMA because when you're a kid ,COMMA you take things for granted .PERIOD 
You learn things unconsciously .PERIOD 
But for me ,COMMA I was an adult and it was embarrassing ,COMMA and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips ,COMMA and capture the air and get the word out .PERIOD 
So I acted like a two-year-old and refused to work .PERIOD 
But the men had a better idea .PERIOD 
They were going to make it fun for me .PERIOD 
So they were teaching me cuss word Scrabble at night ,COMMA and then ,COMMA secretly ,COMMA how to swear like a sailor .PERIOD 
So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when Sally finally got my confidence built .PERIOD 
So I moved on from there .PERIOD 
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write .PERIOD 
So we'll just keep moving on .PERIOD 
One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross a street again as a blind person .PERIOD 
So close your eyes .PERIOD 
Now imagine you have to cross a street .PERIOD 
You don't know how far that street is and you don't know if you're going straight and you hear cars whizzing back and forth ,COMMA and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation .PERIOD 
So there were two obstacles I had to get through .PERIOD 
One was post-traumatic stress disorder .PERIOD 
And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic .PERIOD 
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street .PERIOD 
So one of the seniors just came up to me ,COMMA and she pushed me up to the corner and she said ,COMMA When you think it's time to go ,COMMA just stick the cane out there .PERIOD 
If it's hit ,COMMA don't cross the street .PERIOD 
Made perfect sense .PERIOD 
But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road ,COMMA they realized that they needed to put the resources together ,COMMA and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person ,COMMA and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life .PERIOD 
And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me ,COMMA and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained .PERIOD 
<NUM> years later I gained my sight back .PERIOD 
Not magically .PERIOD 
I opted in for three surgeries ,COMMA and one of them was experimental .PERIOD 
It was actually robotic surgery .PERIOD 
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye .PERIOD 
The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward ,COMMA that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -DASH -DASH cellphones ,COMMA laptops ,COMMA all these things that I had never seen before .PERIOD 
And as a blind person ,COMMA your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell .PERIOD 
So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster .PERIOD 
So I was walking around it .PERIOD 
And I go ,COMMA I'm just going to touch it .PERIOD 
And I touched it and I went ,COMMA Oh my God ,COMMA it's a laundry basket .PERIOD 
But when you're blind ,COMMA you have the tactile memory for things .PERIOD 
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost <NUM> years of my life .PERIOD 
I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends .PERIOD 
But when I looked down ,COMMA I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up ,COMMA so I got going on it .PERIOD 
But the concept held true -DASH -DASH people working with people to rebuild me ;SEMICOLON people working with people to re-educate me .PERIOD 
I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
On the 30th of May ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris .PERIOD 
The young man's name was Evariste Galois .PERIOD 
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time .PERIOD 
I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of <NUM> .PERIOD 
It wasn't ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous .PERIOD 
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris ,COMMA trying to explain his theory .PERIOD 
But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote .PERIOD 
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the night before that duel ,COMMA he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough .PERIOD 
So he stayed up the whole night ,COMMA writing away ,COMMA trying to explain his ideas .PERIOD 
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny ,COMMA he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation .PERIOD 
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed .PERIOD 
But contained inside those documents was a new language ,COMMA a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -DASH -DASH namely symmetry .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA symmetry is almost nature's language .PERIOD 
It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA molecular structure .PERIOD 
What crystals are possible ,COMMA we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry .PERIOD 
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object ,COMMA because they are generally rather nasty .PERIOD 
The swine flu virus ,COMMA at the moment ,COMMA is a symmetrical object .PERIOD 
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well .PERIOD 
But on a larger scale of biology ,COMMA actually symmetry is very important ,COMMA because it actually communicates genetic information .PERIOD 
I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical .PERIOD 
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful ,COMMA you're probably drawn to the lower two .PERIOD 
Because it is hard to make symmetry .PERIOD 
And if you can make yourself symmetrical ,COMMA you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes ,COMMA you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate .PERIOD 
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information .PERIOD 
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN .PERIOD 
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there ,COMMA it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space .PERIOD 
And I think Galileo summed up ,COMMA very nicely ,COMMA the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .PERIOD 
He wrote ,COMMA The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .PERIOD 
It is written in mathematical language ,COMMA and the letters are triangles ,COMMA circles and other geometric figures ,COMMA without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word .PERIOD 
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry .PERIOD 
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it .PERIOD 
He has a character describing the snowflake ,COMMA and he says he shuddered at its perfect precision ,COMMA found it deathly ,COMMA the very marrow of death .PERIOD 
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them .PERIOD 
And a beautiful example of this I found ,COMMA actually ,COMMA when I visited a colleague of mine in Japan ,COMMA Professor Kurokawa .PERIOD 
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko .PERIOD 
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs .PERIOD 
Seven of them are exactly the same ,COMMA and the eighth one is turned upside down .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD It was a very deliberate act .PERIOD 
And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese Essays in Idleness from the 14th century ,COMMA in which the essayist wrote ,COMMA In everything ,COMMA uniformity is undesirable .PERIOD 
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting ,COMMA and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth .PERIOD 
Even when building the Imperial Palace ,COMMA they always leave one place unfinished .PERIOD 
But if I had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island ,COMMA to live the rest of my life ,COMMA being an addict of symmetry ,COMMA I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada .PERIOD 
This is a palace celebrating symmetry .PERIOD 
This is my son Tamer .PERIOD You can see he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra .PERIOD 
But I wanted to try and enrich him .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra .PERIOD 
You see it already .PERIOD Immediately you go in ,COMMA the reflective symmetry in the water .PERIOD 
But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening .PERIOD 
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls .PERIOD 
And so what is symmetry ?QUESTIONMARK 
The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions .PERIOD 
What is symmetry ?QUESTIONMARK When [there] are two of these walls ,COMMA do they have the same symmetries ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions .PERIOD 
For Galois ,COMMA symmetry -DASH -DASH unlike for Thomas Mann ,COMMA which was something still and deathly -DASH -DASH for Galois ,COMMA symmetry was all about motion .PERIOD 
What can you do to a symmetrical object ,COMMA move it in some way ,COMMA so it looks the same as before you moved it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves .PERIOD 
What can you do to something ?QUESTIONMARK You close your eyes .PERIOD 
I do something ,COMMA put it back down again .PERIOD 
It looks like it did before it started .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the walls in the Alhambra -DASH -DASH I can take all of these tiles ,COMMA and fix them at the yellow place ,COMMA rotate them by <NUM> degrees ,COMMA put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there .PERIOD 
And if you open your eyes again ,COMMA you wouldn't know that they'd moved .PERIOD 
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra .PERIOD 
But it's also about producing a language to describe this .PERIOD 
So I'm going to take you through ,COMMA perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -DASH -DASH so brace yourselves -DASH -DASH push you a little bit to understand how this language works ,COMMA which enables us to capture what is symmetry .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's take these two symmetrical objects here .PERIOD 
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish .PERIOD 
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn ,COMMA and still it looks like it did before I started .PERIOD 
I could rotate it by a third of a turn ,COMMA or a half a turn ,COMMA or put it back down on its image ,COMMA or two thirds of a turn .PERIOD 
And a fifth symmetry ,COMMA I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn .PERIOD 
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA for Galois ,COMMA there was actually a sixth symmetry .PERIOD 
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started ?QUESTIONMARK 
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it ,COMMA haven't I ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's got no reflective symmetry .PERIOD 
But what I could do is just leave it where it is ,COMMA pick it up ,COMMA and put it down again .PERIOD 
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry .PERIOD 
It seems mad to talk about nothing .PERIOD 
And this is the same idea .PERIOD This is a symmetrical -DASH -DASH so everything has symmetry ,COMMA where you just leave it where it is .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this object has six symmetries .PERIOD 
And what about the triangle ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise .PERIOD 
But now this has some reflectional symmetry .PERIOD 
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport ,COMMA and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it .PERIOD 
So here is a little question for you .PERIOD 
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer .PERIOD 
The Rubik's Cube .PERIOD 
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have ?QUESTIONMARK 
How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube ?QUESTIONMARK 
Okay ?QUESTIONMARK So I want you to think about that problem as we go on ,COMMA and count how many symmetries there are .PERIOD 
And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end .PERIOD 
But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects .PERIOD 
What Galois realized :COLON it isn't just the individual symmetries ,COMMA but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object .PERIOD 
If I do one magic trick move followed by another ,COMMA the combination is a third magic trick move .PERIOD 
And here we see Galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen ,COMMA the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn ,COMMA and then a third of a turn ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I've given names .PERIOD The capital letters ,COMMA A ,COMMA B ,COMMA C ,COMMA D ,COMMA E ,COMMA F ,COMMA are the names for the rotations .PERIOD 
B ,COMMA for example ,COMMA rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
So what if I do B ,COMMA which is a sixth of a turn ,COMMA followed by C ,COMMA which is a third of a turn ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well let's do that .PERIOD A sixth of a turn ,COMMA followed by a third of a turn ,COMMA the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go .PERIOD 
I do one followed by another ,COMMA the answer is it's rotation D ,COMMA half a turn .PERIOD 
What I if I did it in the other order ?QUESTIONMARK Would it make any difference ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's see .PERIOD Let's do the third of the turn first ,COMMA and then the sixth of a turn .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA it doesn't make any difference .PERIOD 
It still ends up at half a turn .PERIOD 
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other .PERIOD 
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle .PERIOD 
Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle ,COMMA one after the other .PERIOD 
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise ,COMMA and reflect in the line through X .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's do it in a different order .PERIOD 
Let's do the reflection in X first ,COMMA followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .PERIOD 
The combined effect ,COMMA the triangle ends up somewhere completely different .PERIOD 
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y .PERIOD 
Now it matters what order you do the operations in .PERIOD 
But the way the symmetries interact enable us -DASH -DASH we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different .PERIOD 
And you can try this when you go down to the pub ,COMMA later on .PERIOD 
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn ,COMMA then flip it .PERIOD And then do it in the other order ,COMMA and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Galois produced some laws for how these tables -DASH -DASH how symmetries interact .PERIOD 
It's almost like little Sudoku tables .PERIOD 
You don't see any symmetry twice in any row or column .PERIOD 
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle ,COMMA or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish .PERIOD 
I think this is an amazing development .PERIOD 
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry .PERIOD 
In the front here ,COMMA I've got one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three people sitting on one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three chairs .PERIOD 
The people on the chairs are very different ,COMMA but the number ,COMMA the abstract idea of the number ,COMMA is the same .PERIOD 
And we can see this now :COLON we go back to the walls in the Alhambra .PERIOD 
Here are two very different walls ,COMMA very different geometric pictures .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA using the language of Galois ,COMMA we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA let's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them .PERIOD 
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors .PERIOD We're not matching up the colors .PERIOD 
But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet .PERIOD 
What about the center of a triangle ?QUESTIONMARK I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle ,COMMA and everything matches up .PERIOD 
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge ,COMMA where I can rotate by <NUM> degrees .PERIOD 
So rotate along halfway along the edge ,COMMA and they all match up .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra .PERIOD 
And we find the same symmetries here ,COMMA and the same interaction .PERIOD 
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars .PERIOD 
And although these walls look very different ,COMMA Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same .PERIOD 
And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2 .PERIOD 
Here is another example in the Alhambra .PERIOD 
This is a wall ,COMMA a ceiling ,COMMA and a floor .PERIOD 
They all look very different .PERIOD But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object ,COMMA which we call 4-4-2 .PERIOD Nothing to do with football ,COMMA but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn ,COMMA and one by half a turn .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this power of the language is even more ,COMMA because Galois can say ,COMMA Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it turns out they almost did .PERIOD 
You can prove ,COMMA using Galois' language ,COMMA there are actually only <NUM> different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra .PERIOD 
And they ,COMMA if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one ,COMMA it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these <NUM> .PERIOD 
But these are things that we can see .PERIOD 
And the power of Galois' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world ,COMMA beyond the two-dimensional ,COMMA three-dimensional ,COMMA all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space .PERIOD 
And that's where I work .PERIOD I create mathematical objects ,COMMA symmetrical objects ,COMMA using Galois' language ,COMMA in very high dimensional spaces .PERIOD 
So I think it's a great example of things unseen ,COMMA which the power of mathematical language allows you to create .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA like Galois ,COMMA I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you ,COMMA and I've got a picture of it here .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA unfortunately it isn't really a picture .PERIOD If I could have my board at the side here ,COMMA great ,COMMA excellent .PERIOD 
Here we are .PERIOD Unfortunately ,COMMA I can't show you a picture of this symmetrical object .PERIOD 
But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA people like getting their names on things ,COMMA on craters on the moon or new species of animals .PERIOD 
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before .PERIOD 
And this thing -DASH -DASH species die away ,COMMA and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -DASH -DASH but this mathematical object will live forever .PERIOD 
It will make you immortal .PERIOD 
In order to win this symmetrical object ,COMMA what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA I'm going to sort you out .PERIOD 
If you've got it as a factorial ,COMMA you've got to expand the factorials .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA now if you want to play ,COMMA I want you to stand up ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits ,COMMA right -DASH -DASH we've already got one competitor here .PERIOD 
If you all stay down he wins it automatically .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD Excellent .PERIOD So we've got four here ,COMMA five ,COMMA six .PERIOD 
Great .PERIOD Excellent .PERIOD That should get us going .PERIOD All right .PERIOD 
Anybody with five or less digits ,COMMA you've got to sit down ,COMMA because you've underestimated .PERIOD 
Five or less digits .PERIOD So ,COMMA if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down .PERIOD 
<NUM> digits or more ,COMMA you've got to sit down .PERIOD 
You've overestimated .PERIOD 
<NUM> digits or less ,COMMA sit down .PERIOD 
How many digits are there in your number ?QUESTIONMARK 
Two ?QUESTIONMARK So you should have sat down earlier .PERIOD 
Let's have the other ones ,COMMA who sat down during the <NUM> ,COMMA up again .PERIOD Okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
If I told you <NUM> or less ,COMMA stand up .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA how many digits do you have in your number ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> .PERIOD Okay good .PERIOD How many do you have in yours ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> .PERIOD So it goes to this lady here .PERIOD 
<NUM> is the closest .PERIOD 
It actually has -DASH -DASH the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has <NUM> digits .PERIOD 
So now I need to name this object .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what is your name ?QUESTIONMARK 
I need your surname .PERIOD Symmetrical objects generally -DASH -DASH spell it for me .PERIOD 
G-H-E-Z No ,COMMA SO2 has already been used ,COMMA actually ,COMMA in the mathematical language .PERIOD So you can't have that one .PERIOD 
So Ghez ,COMMA there we go .PERIOD That's your new symmetrical object .PERIOD 
You are now immortal .PERIOD 
And if you'd like your own symmetrical object ,COMMA I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala ,COMMA where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you ,COMMA for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala .PERIOD 
And I think what drives me ,COMMA as a mathematician ,COMMA are those things which are not seen ,COMMA the things that we haven't discovered .PERIOD 
It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject .PERIOD 
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese Essays in Idleness :COLON In everything ,COMMA uniformity is undesirable .PERIOD 
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting ,COMMA and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
I didn't always love unintended consequences ,COMMA but I've really learned to appreciate them .PERIOD 
I've learned that they're really the essence of what makes for progress ,COMMA even when they seem to be terrible .PERIOD 
Let's go to <NUM> years before the present ,COMMA to the time of the cultural explosion ,COMMA when music ,COMMA art ,COMMA technology ,COMMA so many of the things that we're enjoying today ,COMMA so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED were born .PERIOD 
And the anthropologist Randall White has made a very interesting observation :COLON that if our ancestors <NUM> years ago had been able to see what they had done ,COMMA they wouldn't have really understood it .PERIOD 
They were responding to immediate concerns .PERIOD 
They were making it possible for us to do what they do ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA they didn't really understand how they did it .PERIOD 
Now let's advance to <NUM> years before the present .PERIOD 
And this is when it really gets interesting .PERIOD 
What about the domestication of grains ?QUESTIONMARK 
What about the origins of agriculture ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would our ancestors <NUM> years ago have said if they really had technology assessment ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I could just imagine the committees reporting back to them on where agriculture was going to take humanity ,COMMA at least in the next few hundred years .PERIOD 
It was really bad news .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA worse nutrition ,COMMA maybe shorter life spans .PERIOD 
It was simply awful for women .PERIOD 
The skeletal remains from that period have shown that they were grinding grain morning ,COMMA noon and night .PERIOD 
And politically ,COMMA it was awful .PERIOD 
It was the beginning of a much higher degree of inequality among people .PERIOD 
If there had been rational technology assessment then ,COMMA I think they very well might have said ,COMMA Let's call the whole thing off .PERIOD 
Even now ,COMMA our choices are having unintended effects .PERIOD 
Historically ,COMMA for example ,COMMA chopsticks -DASH -DASH according to one Japanese anthropologist who wrote a dissertation about it at the University of Michigan -DASH -DASH resulted in long-term changes in the dentition ,COMMA in the teeth ,COMMA of the Japanese public .PERIOD 
And we are also changing our teeth right now .PERIOD 
There is evidence that the human mouth and teeth are growing smaller all the time .PERIOD 
That's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence .PERIOD 
But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal ,COMMA there would have been a lot of disapproval of the wimpish choppers that we now have .PERIOD 
So these things are kind of relative to where you or your ancestors happen to stand .PERIOD 
In the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences ,COMMA and there was a very healthy sense of caution ,COMMA reflected in the Tree of Knowledge ,COMMA in Pandora's Box ,COMMA and especially in the myth of Prometheus that's been so important in recent metaphors about technology .PERIOD 
And that's all very true .PERIOD 
The physicians of the ancient world -DASH -DASH especially the Egyptians ,COMMA who started medicine as we know it -DASH -DASH were very conscious of what they could and couldn't treat .PERIOD 
And the translations of the surviving texts say ,COMMA This I will not treat .PERIOD This I cannot treat .PERIOD 
They were very conscious .PERIOD 
So were the followers of Hippocrates .PERIOD 
The Hippocratic manuscripts also -DASH -DASH repeatedly ,COMMA according to recent studies -DASH -DASH show how important it is not to do harm .PERIOD 
More recently ,COMMA Harvey Cushing ,COMMA who really developed neurosurgery as we know it ,COMMA who changed it from a field of medicine that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery to one in which there was a hopeful outlook ,COMMA he was very conscious that he was not always going to do the right thing .PERIOD 
Now if we look forward a bit to the 19th century ,COMMA we find a new style of technology .PERIOD 
What we find is ,COMMA no longer simple tools ,COMMA but systems .PERIOD 
We find more and more complex arrangements of machines that make it harder and harder to diagnose what's going on .PERIOD 
And the first people who saw that were the telegraphers of the mid-19th century ,COMMA who were the original hackers .PERIOD 
Thomas Edison would have been very ,COMMA very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software firm today .PERIOD 
And these hackers had a word for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems that they called bugs .PERIOD 
That was the origin of the word bug .PERIOD 
This consciousness ,COMMA though ,COMMA was a little slow to seep through the general population ,COMMA even people who were very ,COMMA very well informed .PERIOD 
Samuel Clemens ,COMMA Mark Twain ,COMMA was a big investor in the most complex machine of all times -DASH -DASH at least until <NUM> -DASH -DASH registered with the U.S .PERIOD Patent Office .PERIOD 
That was the Paige typesetter .PERIOD 
The Paige typesetter had <NUM> parts .PERIOD 
The patent had <NUM> pages of text and <NUM> figures .PERIOD 
It was such a beautiful machine because it did everything that a human being did in setting type -DASH -DASH including returning the type to its place ,COMMA which was a very difficult thing .PERIOD 
And Mark Twain ,COMMA who knew all about typesetting ,COMMA really was smitten by this machine .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA he was smitten in more ways than one ,COMMA because it made him bankrupt ,COMMA and he had to tour the world speaking to recoup his money .PERIOD 
And this was an important thing about 19th century technology ,COMMA that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart ,COMMA even when judged by the most expert people .PERIOD 
Now there is something else ,COMMA though ,COMMA in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .PERIOD 
And that was that safety technology itself could be a source of danger .PERIOD 
The lesson of the Titanic ,COMMA for a lot of the contemporaries ,COMMA was that you must have enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship .PERIOD 
And this was the result of the tragic loss of lives of people who could not get into them .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA there was another case ,COMMA the Eastland ,COMMA a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in <NUM> ,COMMA and it killed <NUM> people -DASH -DASH that was <NUM> more than the passenger toll of the Titanic .PERIOD 
The reason for it ,COMMA in part ,COMMA was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable .PERIOD 
And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences ,COMMA it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw .PERIOD 
It's really a question of the system ,COMMA how the ship was loaded ,COMMA the ballast and many other things .PERIOD 
So the 20th century ,COMMA then ,COMMA saw how much more complex reality was ,COMMA but it also saw a positive side .PERIOD 
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies .PERIOD 
It could benefit from tragedies .PERIOD 
And my favorite example of that -DASH -DASH which is not really widely known as a technological miracle ,COMMA but it may be one of the greatest of all times ,COMMA was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War .PERIOD 
Penicillin was discovered in <NUM> ,COMMA but even by <NUM> ,COMMA no commercially and medically useful quantities of it were being produced .PERIOD 
A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it .PERIOD 
They were working on it independently ,COMMA and they weren't getting anywhere .PERIOD 
And the Government Research Bureau brought representatives together and told them that this is something that has to be done .PERIOD 
And not only did they do it ,COMMA but within two years ,COMMA they scaled up penicillin from preparation in one-liter flasks to <NUM> ,COMMA 000-gallon vats .PERIOD 
That was how quickly penicillin was produced and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time .PERIOD 
In the Second World War ,COMMA too ,COMMA the existence of solar radiation was demonstrated by studies of interference that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain .PERIOD 
Now when we come to the period after the Second World War ,COMMA unintended consequences get even more interesting .PERIOD 
And my favorite example of that occurred beginning in <NUM> ,COMMA when it was discovered that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters ,COMMA but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating ,COMMA ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of Legionella bacillus .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA technology to the rescue .PERIOD 
So chemists got to work ,COMMA and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems .PERIOD 
But something else happened in the early 1980s ,COMMA and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic of failures of tape drives all over the United States .PERIOD 
And IBM ,COMMA which made them ,COMMA just didn't know what to do .PERIOD 
They commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate ,COMMA and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts .PERIOD 
What happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin .PERIOD 
And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads and were crashing the tape heads .PERIOD 
So they reformulated the bactericide .PERIOD 
But what's interesting to me is that this was the first case of a mechanical device suffering ,COMMA at least indirectly ,COMMA from a human disease .PERIOD 
So it shows that we're really all in this together .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it also shows something interesting ,COMMA that although our capabilities and technology have been expanding geometrically ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA our ability to model their long-term behavior ,COMMA which has also been increasing ,COMMA has been increasing only arithmetically .PERIOD 
So one of the characteristic problems of our time is how to close this gap between capabilities and foresight .PERIOD 
One other very positive consequence of 20th century technology ,COMMA though ,COMMA was the way in which other kinds of calamities could lead to positive advances .PERIOD 
And nobody knows just why this was so ,COMMA but one story can reflect something of it .PERIOD 
It was the origin of the Xerox copier ,COMMA which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year .PERIOD 
And Chester Carlson ,COMMA the inventor ,COMMA was a patent attorney .PERIOD 
He really was not intending to work in patent research ,COMMA but he couldn't really find an alternative technical job .PERIOD 
So this was the best job he could get .PERIOD 
He was upset by the low quality and high cost of existing patent reproductions ,COMMA and so he started to develop a system of dry photocopying ,COMMA which he patented in the late 1930s -DASH -DASH and which became the first dry photocopier that was commercially practical in <NUM> .PERIOD 
What does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
It means ,COMMA I think ,COMMA that we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities .PERIOD 
Think of the financial world ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
The mentor of Warren Buffett ,COMMA Benjamin Graham ,COMMA developed his system of value investing as a result of his own losses in the <NUM> crash .PERIOD 
And he published that book in the early 1930s ,COMMA and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook .PERIOD 
So many important creative things can happen when people learn from disasters .PERIOD 
Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now -DASH -DASH bed bugs ,COMMA killer bees ,COMMA spam -DASH -DASH and it's very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question .PERIOD 
If we think ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of Louis Pasteur ,COMMA who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry ,COMMA and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .PERIOD 
So very often ,COMMA some kind of disaster -DASH -DASH sometimes the consequence ,COMMA for example ,COMMA of over-cultivation of silk worms ,COMMA which was a problem in Europe at the time -DASH -DASH can be the key to something much bigger .PERIOD 
So this means that we need to take a different view of unintended consequences .PERIOD 
We need to take a really positive view .PERIOD 
We need to learn from those figures that I mentioned .PERIOD 
We need to learn ,COMMA for example ,COMMA from Dr .PERIOD Cushing ,COMMA who killed patients in the course of his early operations .PERIOD 
He had to have some errors .PERIOD He had to have some mistakes .PERIOD 
And he learned meticulously from his mistakes .PERIOD 
And as a result ,COMMA when we say ,COMMA This isn't brain surgery ,COMMA that pays tribute to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mistakes in a field of medicine that was considered so discouraging in its prospects .PERIOD 
And we can also remember how the pharmaceutical companies were willing to pool their knowledge ,COMMA to share their knowledge ,COMMA in the face of an emergency ,COMMA which they hadn't really been for years and years .PERIOD 
They might have been able to do it earlier .PERIOD 
The message ,COMMA then ,COMMA for me ,COMMA about unintended consequences is chaos happens ;SEMICOLON let's make better use of it .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I kind of believe that we're in like the cave-painting era of computer interfaces .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA they're very kind of -DASH -DASH they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that .PERIOD 
Hit me .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD So I mean ,COMMA this is the kind of status quo interface ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's very flat ,COMMA kind of rigid .PERIOD 
And OK ,COMMA so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac ,COMMA you know ,COMMA but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers .PERIOD 
I mean it's point and click ,COMMA it's like the menus ,COMMA icons ,COMMA it's all the kind of same thing .PERIOD 
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk .PERIOD 
It's so much more subtle ,COMMA so much more visceral -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA what's visible ,COMMA what's not .PERIOD 
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop .PERIOD 
So I kind of have a -DASH -DASH this is BumpTop .PERIOD 
So you can bump things -DASH -DASH they're all physically ,COMMA you know ,COMMA manipulable and stuff .PERIOD 
And instead of that point and click ,COMMA it's like a push and pull ,COMMA things collide as you'd expect them .PERIOD Just like on my real desk ,COMMA I can -DASH -DASH let me just grab these guys -DASH -DASH I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have .PERIOD 
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid ,COMMA or you know ,COMMA flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards .PERIOD 
When they're laid out ,COMMA I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just immediately ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then ,COMMA it's all smoothly animated ,COMMA instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA if I want to add something to a pile ,COMMA well ,COMMA how do I do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
I just toss it to the pile ,COMMA and it's added right to the top .PERIOD It's a kind of nice way .PERIOD 
Also some of the stuff we can do is ,COMMA for these individual icons we thought -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA how can we play with the idea of an icon ,COMMA and push that further ?QUESTIONMARK 
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important .PERIOD 
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this ,COMMA it's actually heavier .PERIOD So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So it's cute ,COMMA but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is heavy so it feels more important .PERIOD So it's kind of cool .PERIOD 
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared ,COMMA because it has a lot of ,COMMA I think ,COMMA valuable properties .PERIOD 
So one of the things you can do to our icons ,COMMA just like paper ,COMMA is crease them and fold them ,COMMA just like paper .PERIOD Remember ,COMMA you know ,COMMA something for later .PERIOD 
Or if you want to be destructive ,COMMA you can just crumple it up and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA toss it to the corner .PERIOD 
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Okay ,COMMA well my real desk is really messy .PERIOD I don't want that mess on my computer .PERIOD 
More boring ,COMMA but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping .PERIOD 
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop .PERIOD 
Let's just break this shelf .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA that shelf broke .PERIOD 
I think beyond the icons ,COMMA I think another really cool domain for this software -DASH -DASH I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -DASH -DASH but browsing photographs .PERIOD 
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .PERIOD 
I can toss these things around .PERIOD They're so much more tangible and touchable -DASH -DASH and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it .PERIOD 
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before .PERIOD 
So I can pile things up ,COMMA I can flip through it ,COMMA I can ,COMMA you know -DASH -DASH okay ,COMMA let's move this photo to the back ,COMMA let's delete this guy here ,COMMA and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information .PERIOD 
And that's BumpTop .PERIOD Thanks !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar ,COMMA and it's real ,COMMA in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo .PERIOD 
But it's also a fiction .PERIOD There's a lot of work that went into it after that .PERIOD 
And what he's done is he's actually reshaped ,COMMA digitally ,COMMA all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index .PERIOD 
So what you see ,COMMA that precipice ,COMMA that high precipice with the valley ,COMMA is the <NUM> financial crisis .PERIOD 
I don't know where we are now .PERIOD 
This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong .PERIOD 
And similar topography .PERIOD 
I wonder why .PERIOD 
And this is art .PERIOD This is metaphor .PERIOD 
That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it -DASH -DASH the world around us and the world inside us .PERIOD 
And it's specifically algorithms ,COMMA which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff .PERIOD 
They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again ,COMMA and they ossify and calcify ,COMMA and they become real .PERIOD 
And I was thinking about this ,COMMA of all places ,COMMA on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago ,COMMA because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA So what were you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Well we were mostly breaking stealth .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA That's a good job .PERIOD That's interesting .PERIOD 
How does that work ?QUESTIONMARK 
And to understand that ,COMMA you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .PERIOD 
And so -DASH -DASH this is an over-simplification -DASH -DASH but basically ,COMMA it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through <NUM> tons of steel in the sky .PERIOD 
It's not just going to disappear .PERIOD 
But if you can take this big ,COMMA massive thing ,COMMA and you could turn it into a million little things -DASH -DASH something like a flock of birds -DASH -DASH well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky .PERIOD 
And if you're a radar ,COMMA that's a really bad job .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Yeah .PERIOD He said ,COMMA But that's if you're a radar .PERIOD 
So we didn't use a radar ;SEMICOLON we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals ,COMMA electronic communication .PERIOD 
And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA 'Probably has something to do with the Americans.' And I said ,COMMA Yeah .PERIOD 
That's good .PERIOD 
So you've effectively negated <NUM> years of aeronautic research .PERIOD 
What's your act two ?QUESTIONMARK 
What do you do when you grow up ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA financial services .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Oh .PERIOD 
Because those had been in the news lately .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA How does that work ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Well there's <NUM> physicists on Wall Street now ,COMMA and I'm one of them .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA What's the black box for Wall Street ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's also sometimes called algo trading ,COMMA algorithmic trading .PERIOD 
And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had ,COMMA which is that they're moving these positions -DASH -DASH whether it's Proctor &amp ;SEMICOLON Gamble or Accenture ,COMMA whatever -DASH -DASH they're moving a million shares of something through the market .PERIOD 
And if they do that all at once ,COMMA it's like playing poker and going all in right away .PERIOD 
You just tip your hand .PERIOD 
And so they have to find a way -DASH -DASH and they use algorithms to do this -DASH -DASH to break up that big thing into a million little transactions .PERIOD 
And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what's actually happening in the market .PERIOD 
So if you need to have some image of what's happening in the stock market right now ,COMMA what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide ,COMMA and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act .PERIOD 
And all of that's great ,COMMA and it's fine .PERIOD 
And that's <NUM> percent of the United States stock market ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension ,COMMA your mortgage .PERIOD 
And what could go wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
What could go wrong is that a year ago ,COMMA nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes ,COMMA and they called it the Flash Crash of <NUM> :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
All of a sudden ,COMMA nine percent just goes away ,COMMA and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it ,COMMA nobody asked for it .PERIOD 
Nobody had any control over what was actually happening .PERIOD 
All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said ,COMMA Stop .PERIOD 
And that's the thing ,COMMA is that we're writing things ,COMMA we're writing these things that we can no longer read .PERIOD 
And we've rendered something illegible ,COMMA and we've lost the sense of what's actually happening in this world that we've made .PERIOD 
And we're starting to make our way .PERIOD 
And they do what we've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don't understand -DASH -DASH which is that they give them a name and a story .PERIOD 
So this is one that they found ,COMMA they called the Knife ,COMMA the Carnival ,COMMA the Boston Shuffler ,COMMA Twilight .PERIOD 
And the gag is that ,COMMA of course ,COMMA these aren't just running through the market .PERIOD 
You can find these kinds of things wherever you look ,COMMA once you learn how to look for them .PERIOD 
You can find it here :COLON this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon .PERIOD 
You may have noticed it when its price started at <NUM> million dollars .PERIOD 
It's out of print -DASH -DASH still .. .PERIOD 
If you had bought it at <NUM> ,COMMA it would have been a bargain .PERIOD 
A few hours later ,COMMA it had gone up to <NUM> million dollars ,COMMA plus shipping and handling .PERIOD 
And the question is :COLON Nobody was buying or selling anything ;SEMICOLON what was happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street .PERIOD 
And when you see this kind of behavior ,COMMA what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict ,COMMA algorithms locked in loops with each other ,COMMA without any human oversight ,COMMA without any adult supervision to say ,COMMA Actually ,COMMA <NUM> million is plenty .PERIOD 
And as with Amazon ,COMMA so it is with Netflix .PERIOD 
And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years .PERIOD 
They started with Cinematch ,COMMA and they've tried a bunch of others -DASH -DASH there's Dinosaur Planet ;SEMICOLON there's Gravity .PERIOD 
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now .PERIOD 
It's trying to get a grasp on you ,COMMA on the firmware inside the human skull ,COMMA so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next -DASH -DASH which is a very ,COMMA very difficult problem .PERIOD 
But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down ,COMMA it doesn't take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has .PERIOD 
So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for <NUM> percent of those movies .PERIOD 
But what if you could rate those movies before they get made ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA a few data scientists from the U.K .PERIOD are in Hollywood ,COMMA and they have story algorithms -DASH -DASH a company called Epagogix .PERIOD 
And you can run your script through there ,COMMA and they can tell you ,COMMA quantifiably ,COMMA that that's a <NUM> million dollar movie or a <NUM> million dollar movie .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA is that this isn't Google .PERIOD 
This isn't information .PERIOD 
These aren't financial stats ;SEMICOLON this is culture .PERIOD 
And what you see here ,COMMA or what you don't really see normally ,COMMA is that these are the physics of culture .PERIOD 
And if these algorithms ,COMMA like the algorithms on Wall Street ,COMMA just crashed one day and went awry ,COMMA how would we know ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would it look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they're in your house .PERIOD They're in your house .PERIOD 
These are two algorithms competing for your living room .PERIOD 
These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means .PERIOD 
And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them ,COMMA and they're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom .PERIOD 
And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched .PERIOD 
It's super-real and it's happening around you .PERIOD 
You feel it most when you're in a sealed metal box ,COMMA a new-style elevator ;SEMICOLON they're called destination-control elevators .PERIOD 
These are the ones where you have to press what floor you're going to go to before you get in the elevator .PERIOD 
So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want .PERIOD 
Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two ,COMMA and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five .PERIOD 
And the problem with that is that people freak out .PERIOD 
People panic .PERIOD 
And you see why .PERIOD You see why .PERIOD 
It's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation ,COMMA like the buttons .PERIOD 
Like the things that people use .PERIOD 
All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says ,COMMA Stop .PERIOD 
And this is what we're designing for .PERIOD 
We're designing for this machine dialect .PERIOD 
And how far can you take that ?QUESTIONMARK How far can you take it ?QUESTIONMARK 
You can take it really ,COMMA really far .PERIOD 
So let me take it back to Wall Street .PERIOD 
Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else ,COMMA which is speed .PERIOD 
And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds .PERIOD 
And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are ,COMMA it takes you <NUM> microseconds just to click a mouse .PERIOD 
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind ,COMMA you're a loser .PERIOD 
So if you were an algorithm ,COMMA you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -DASH -DASH throwing out all the furniture ,COMMA all the infrastructure for human use ,COMMA and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -DASH -DASH all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet .PERIOD 
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA it is ,COMMA but it's distributed from places .PERIOD 
In New York ,COMMA this is where it's distributed from :COLON the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street .PERIOD 
And the reality is that the further away you are from that ,COMMA you're a few microseconds behind every time .PERIOD 
These guys down on Wall Street ,COMMA Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation ,COMMA they're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel .PERIOD 
And that's going to keep happening .PERIOD 
We're going to keep hollowing them out ,COMMA because you ,COMMA inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar ,COMMA none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the Boston Shuffler could .PERIOD 
But if you zoom out ,COMMA if you zoom out ,COMMA you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago that's been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks .PERIOD 
This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal <NUM> times faster than you can click a mouse -DASH -DASH just for these algorithms ,COMMA just for the Carnival and the Knife .PERIOD 
And when you think about this ,COMMA that we're running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster ,COMMA all for a communications framework that no human will ever know ,COMMA that's a kind of manifest destiny ;SEMICOLON and we'll always look for a new frontier .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA we have our work cut out for us .PERIOD 
This is just theoretical .PERIOD 
This is some mathematicians at MIT .PERIOD 
And the truth is I don't really understand a lot of what they're talking about .PERIOD 
It involves light cones and quantum entanglement ,COMMA and I don't really understand any of that .PERIOD 
But I can read this map ,COMMA and what this map says is that ,COMMA if you're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are ,COMMA that's where people are ,COMMA where the cities are ,COMMA you're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .PERIOD 
And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean .PERIOD 
So that's what we'll do :COLON we'll build bubbles or something ,COMMA or platforms .PERIOD 
We'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air ,COMMA because it's a bright future if you're an algorithm .PERIOD 
And it's not the money that's so interesting actually .PERIOD 
It's what the money motivates ,COMMA that we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency .PERIOD 
And in that light ,COMMA you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs ,COMMA and you realize that they're not metaphor ,COMMA they're prophecy .PERIOD 
They're prophecy for the kind of seismic ,COMMA terrestrial effects of the math that we're making .PERIOD 
And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird ,COMMA uneasy collaboration between nature and man .PERIOD 
But now there's this third co-evolutionary force :COLON algorithms -DASH -DASH the Boston Shuffler ,COMMA the Carnival .PERIOD 
And we will have to understand those as nature ,COMMA and in a way ,COMMA they are .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation ,COMMA sharing some of the problems .PERIOD 
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -DASH -DASH being honest about what was going well ,COMMA what wasn't ,COMMA and making it kind of an annual thing .PERIOD 
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems ,COMMA because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA the market does not drive the scientists ,COMMA the communicators ,COMMA the thinkers ,COMMA the governments to do the right things .PERIOD 
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .PERIOD 
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .PERIOD 
Any tough problem ,COMMA I think it can be solved .PERIOD 
Over the past century ,COMMA average lifespan has more than doubled .PERIOD 
As recently as <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> million children were born ,COMMA and <NUM> million of those died before the age of five .PERIOD 
Five years ago ,COMMA <NUM> million children were born -DASH -DASH so ,COMMA more -DASH -DASH and less than <NUM> million of them died before the age of five .PERIOD 
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate .PERIOD 
It's a phenomenal thing .PERIOD 
Each one of those lives matters a lot .PERIOD 
And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes but also a few key breakthroughs :COLON vaccines that were used more widely .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA measles was four million of the deaths back as recently as <NUM> and now is under <NUM> .PERIOD 
So we really can make changes .PERIOD 
And I think that's doable in well under <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning ,COMMA which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitoes ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA what's the history of this disease ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA if we look at the genetic code ,COMMA it's the only disease we can see that people who lived in Africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .PERIOD 
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s .PERIOD 
So it was absolutely gigantic .PERIOD 
A terrible disease .PERIOD It was in the United States .PERIOD It was in Europe .PERIOD 
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s ,COMMA when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitoes .PERIOD 
So it was everywhere .PERIOD 
One was killing the mosquitoes with DDT .PERIOD 
The other was treating the patients with quinine ,COMMA or quinine derivatives .PERIOD 
And so that's why the death rate did come down .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA ironically ,COMMA what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones ,COMMA which is where the rich countries are .PERIOD 
So we can see :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA it's everywhere .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA it's still most places .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA the U.S .PERIOD and most of Europe have gotten rid of it .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA you've gotten most of the northern areas .PERIOD 
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator .PERIOD 
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries ,COMMA it doesn't get much investment .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA there's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA baldness ,COMMA it's a terrible thing .PERIOD 
And rich men are afflicted .PERIOD 
And so that's why that priority has been set .PERIOD 
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitoes .PERIOD 
I brought some here ,COMMA just so you could experience this .PERIOD 
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .PERIOD 
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience .PERIOD 
Those mosquitoes are not infected .PERIOD 
So we've come up with a few new things .PERIOD We've got bed nets .PERIOD 
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night ,COMMA so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can't get at them .PERIOD 
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT and those nets you can cut deaths by over <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And that's happened now in a number of countries .PERIOD 
It's great to see .PERIOD 
But we have to be careful because malaria -DASH -DASH the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .PERIOD 
And so you end up with two choices .PERIOD 
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way ,COMMA you do it vigorously ,COMMA you can actually get a local eradication .PERIOD 
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA if you go in kind of half-heartedly ,COMMA for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden ,COMMA but eventually those tools will become ineffective ,COMMA and the death rate will soar back up again .PERIOD 
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention .PERIOD 
Now we're on the upswing .PERIOD 
Bed net funding is up .PERIOD 
There's new drug discovery going on .PERIOD 
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months .PERIOD 
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective .PERIOD 
So we're going to have these new tools .PERIOD 
But that alone doesn't give us the road map .PERIOD 
Because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .PERIOD 
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this ,COMMA to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together .PERIOD 
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .PERIOD 
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .PERIOD 
And so as these elements come together ,COMMA I'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .PERIOD 
Now let me turn to a second question ,COMMA a fairly different question ,COMMA but I'd say equally important .PERIOD 
And this is :COLON How do you make a teacher great ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the answer is ,COMMA really ,COMMA that we don't .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA all of us here ,COMMA I'll bet ,COMMA had some great teachers .PERIOD 
We all had a wonderful education .PERIOD 
That's part of the reason we're here today ,COMMA part of the reason we're successful .PERIOD 
I can say that ,COMMA even though I'm a college drop-out .PERIOD 
I had great teachers .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA in the United States ,COMMA the teaching system has worked fairly well .PERIOD 
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .PERIOD 
So the top <NUM> percent of students have gotten a good education .PERIOD 
And those top <NUM> percent have been the best in the world ,COMMA if you measure them against the other top <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S .PERIOD at the forefront .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the strength for those top <NUM> percent is starting to fade on a relative basis ,COMMA but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting .PERIOD 
And if you look at the economy ,COMMA it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education .PERIOD 
And we have to change this .PERIOD 
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .PERIOD 
We have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education ,COMMA like science and mathematics .PERIOD 
When I first learned the statistics ,COMMA I was pretty stunned at how bad things are .PERIOD 
Over <NUM> percent of kids never finish high school .PERIOD 
And that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .PERIOD 
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that .PERIOD 
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that .PERIOD 
They had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
For minority kids ,COMMA it's over <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And even if you graduate from high school ,COMMA if you're low-income ,COMMA you have less than a <NUM> percent chance of ever completing a college degree .PERIOD 
If you're low-income in the United States ,COMMA you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .PERIOD 
And that doesn't seem entirely fair .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how do you make education better ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA our foundation ,COMMA for the last nine years ,COMMA has invested in this .PERIOD 
There's many people working on it .PERIOD 
We've worked on small schools ,COMMA we've funded scholarships ,COMMA we've done things in libraries .PERIOD 
A lot of these things had a good effect .PERIOD 
But the more we looked at it ,COMMA the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .PERIOD 
And we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers ,COMMA between ,COMMA say ,COMMA the top quartile -DASH -DASH the very best -DASH -DASH and the bottom quartile .PERIOD 
How much variation is there within a school or between schools ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable .PERIOD 
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class -DASH -DASH based on test scores -DASH -DASH by over <NUM> percent in a single year .PERIOD 
What does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
That means that if the entire U.S. ,COMMA for two years ,COMMA had top quartile teachers ,COMMA the entire difference between us and Asia would go away .PERIOD 
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's simple .PERIOD All you need are those top quartile teachers .PERIOD 
And so you'd say ,COMMA Wow ,COMMA we should reward those people .PERIOD 
We should retain those people .PERIOD 
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people .PERIOD 
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .PERIOD 
What are the characteristics of this top quartile ?QUESTIONMARK 
What do they look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
You might think these must be very senior teachers .PERIOD 
Once somebody has taught for three years their teaching quality does not change thereafter .PERIOD 
The variation is very ,COMMA very small .PERIOD 
You might think these are people with master's degrees .PERIOD 
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education .PERIOD 
This chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .PERIOD 
That bottom thing ,COMMA which says there's no effect at all ,COMMA is a master's degree .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded .PERIOD 
One is seniority .PERIOD 
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .PERIOD 
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree .PERIOD 
Teach for America :COLON slight effect .PERIOD 
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA overwhelmingly ,COMMA it's your past performance .PERIOD 
There are some people who are very good at this .PERIOD 
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it ,COMMA to raise the average capability -DASH -DASH or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system .PERIOD 
You might say ,COMMA Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave ?QUESTIONMARK 
The answer is ,COMMA on average ,COMMA the slightly better teachers leave the system .PERIOD 
And it's a system with very high turnover .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there are a few places -DASH -DASH very few -DASH -DASH where great teachers are being made .PERIOD 
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP .PERIOD 
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power .PERIOD 
It's an unbelievable thing .PERIOD 
They take the poorest kids ,COMMA and over <NUM> percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges .PERIOD 
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .PERIOD 
They're team teaching .PERIOD They're constantly improving their teachers .PERIOD 
They're taking data ,COMMA the test scores ,COMMA and saying to a teacher ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you caused this amount of increase .PERIOD 
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better .PERIOD 
When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms ,COMMA at first it's very bizarre .PERIOD 
I sat down and I thought ,COMMA What is going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
The teacher was running around ,COMMA and the energy level was high .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA I'm in the sports rally or something .PERIOD 
What's going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention ,COMMA which kids were bored ,COMMA and calling kids rapidly ,COMMA putting things up on the board .PERIOD 
It was a very dynamic environment ,COMMA because particularly in those middle school years -DASH -DASH fifth through eighth grade -DASH -DASH keeping people engaged and setting the tone that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention ,COMMA nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there .PERIOD 
Everybody needs to be involved .PERIOD 
And so KIPP is doing it .PERIOD 
How does that compare to a normal school ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA in a normal school ,COMMA teachers aren't told how good they are .PERIOD 
The data isn't gathered .PERIOD 
In the teacher's contract ,COMMA it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom -DASH -DASH sometimes to once per year .PERIOD 
And they need advanced notice to do that .PERIOD 
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers ,COMMA some of them just making crap and the management is told ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you can only come down here once a year ,COMMA but you need to let us know ,COMMA because we might actually fool you ,COMMA and try and do a good job in that one brief moment .PERIOD 
Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it .PERIOD 
They don't have the test scores ,COMMA and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA New York passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers .PERIOD 
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction .PERIOD 
But I'm optimistic about this ,COMMA I think there are some clear things we can do .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA there's a lot more testing going on ,COMMA and that's given us the picture of where we are .PERIOD 
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well ,COMMA and call them out ,COMMA and find out what those techniques are .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA digital video is cheap now .PERIOD 
Putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools .PERIOD 
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA here's a little clip of something I thought I did well .PERIOD 
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly .PERIOD 
Advise me -DASH -DASH when this kid acted up ,COMMA how should I have dealt with that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they could all sit and work together on those problems .PERIOD 
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it ,COMMA have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff .PERIOD 
You can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course ,COMMA learn from that .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet ,COMMA but you could make it so that DVDs were always available ,COMMA and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers .PERIOD 
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system ,COMMA we can do it much better .PERIOD 
Now there's a book actually ,COMMA about KIPP -DASH -DASH the place that this is going on -DASH -DASH that Jay Matthews ,COMMA a news reporter ,COMMA wrote -DASH -DASH called ,COMMA Work Hard ,COMMA Be Nice .PERIOD 
And I thought it was so fantastic .PERIOD 
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we put a lot of money into education ,COMMA and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .PERIOD 
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -DASH -DASH it's interesting -DASH -DASH the House version actually had money in it for these data systems ,COMMA and it was taken out in the Senate because there are people who are threatened by these things .PERIOD 
But I -DASH -DASH I'm optimistic .PERIOD 
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is ,COMMA and it really can make a difference for millions of lives ,COMMA if we get it right .PERIOD 
I only had time to frame those two problems .PERIOD 
There's a lot more problems like that -DASH -DASH AIDS ,COMMA pneumonia -DASH -DASH I can just see you're getting excited ,COMMA just at the very name of these things .PERIOD 
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the system doesn't naturally make it happen .PERIOD 
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way .PERIOD 
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things .PERIOD 
So it's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things ,COMMA get other people involved -DASH -DASH and you're helping to come up with solutions .PERIOD 
And with that ,COMMA I think there's some great things that will come out of it .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .PERIOD 
I've had some time to think it over .PERIOD 
And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -DASH -DASH it's also about the road .PERIOD 
Road design makes a difference ,COMMA particularly intersections ,COMMA of which there are two types :COLON signalized and unsignalized ,COMMA which means stop signs .PERIOD 
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .PERIOD 
Roundabouts are much better .PERIOD 
A study of <NUM> intersections has found crashes drop <NUM> percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout .PERIOD 
Injury crashes have dropped <NUM> percent ,COMMA fatal crashes down <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
But that's just safety .PERIOD 
What about time and gas ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA traffic keeps flowing ,COMMA so that means less braking ,COMMA which means less accelerating ,COMMA less gas and less pollution ,COMMA less time wasted ,COMMA and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA unsignalized intersections ,COMMA meaning stop signs ,COMMA they save many lives ,COMMA but there's an excessive proliferation of them .PERIOD 
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .PERIOD 
This is one in my neighborhood .PERIOD And they are much better -DASH -DASH better than traffic lights ,COMMA better than four-way stop signs .PERIOD 
They're expensive to install ,COMMA but they are more expensive not to .PERIOD So ,COMMA we should look at that .PERIOD 
But they are not applicable in all situations .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA take ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the three-way intersection .PERIOD 
But the other two are somewhat questionable .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA here's one .PERIOD There's another one which I studied .PERIOD 
Cars rarely appear on that third road .PERIOD 
That intersection I looked at had about <NUM> cars per day in each direction ,COMMA and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .PERIOD 
That's five cents each ,COMMA and times <NUM> cars per day ,COMMA that's $51 ,COMMA <NUM> per year .PERIOD 
What's that time worth ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA at <NUM> seconds per <NUM> cars ,COMMA that's <NUM> hours per day .PERIOD The average wage in the U.S .PERIOD 
is $20 an hour .PERIOD That is <NUM> per year .PERIOD 
Add that together with the gas ,COMMA and it's $112 ,COMMA <NUM> per year ,COMMA just for that sign in each direction .PERIOD 
And you'd still come out ahead .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it makes one wonder ,COMMA Why is it there ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA why is there that stop sign in each direction ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because it is saving lives .PERIOD So ,COMMA is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?QUESTIONMARK 
The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely .PERIOD 
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road .PERIOD 
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .PERIOD 
Stop signs were invented in <NUM> ,COMMA yield signs in <NUM> .PERIOD But that's all we got .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why not use a yield sign ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well the meaning of yield is :COLON You must yield the right-of-way .PERIOD 
That means that if there are five cars waiting ,COMMA you have to wait till they all go ,COMMA then you go .PERIOD It lacks the notion of alternating ,COMMA or taking turns ,COMMA and it's always on the minor road ,COMMA allowing the major one to have primacy .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .PERIOD 
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone ,COMMA OK ,COMMA remember what you used to do at yield signs ?QUESTIONMARK Now do something different .PERIOD 
That would not work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what the world needs now is a new type of sign .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you'd have a little instruction below it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for those who didn't see the public service announcements .PERIOD 
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .PERIOD 
It's kind of shaped like a T ,COMMA as in taking turns .PERIOD 
And uncertainty results in caution .PERIOD 
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now that you are all Road Scholars .. .PERIOD 
don't wait for that sign to be adopted ,COMMA these things don't change quickly .PERIOD 
But you all are members of communities ,COMMA and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows .PERIOD 
And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine ,COMMA and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .PERIOD 
Our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single ,COMMA solo inventor who ,COMMA working late in the lab one night ,COMMA makes an earthshaking discovery ,COMMA and voila ,COMMA overnight everything's changed .PERIOD 
That's a very appealing picture ,COMMA however ,COMMA it's just not true .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA medicine today is a team sport .PERIOD 
And in many ways ,COMMA it always has been .PERIOD 
I'd like to share with you a story about how I've experienced this very dramatically in my own work .PERIOD 
I'm a surgeon ,COMMA and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light .PERIOD 
When I make an incision inside a patient's body ,COMMA it's dark .PERIOD 
We need to shine light to see what we're doing .PERIOD 
And this is why ,COMMA traditionally ,COMMA surgeries have always started so early in the morning -DASH -DASH to take advantage of daylight hours .PERIOD 
And if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms ,COMMA they have been on top of buildings .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA this is the oldest operating room in the Western world ,COMMA in London ,COMMA where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in .PERIOD 
And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America .PERIOD 
This is Mass General in Boston .PERIOD 
And do you know where the operating room is ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in .PERIOD 
So nowadays in the operating room ,COMMA we no longer need to use sunlight .PERIOD 
We have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights -DASH -DASH lights that can allow us to see what we currently don't see .PERIOD 
So let me back up a little bit .PERIOD 
When we are in medical school ,COMMA we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything's color-coded .PERIOD 
Nerves are yellow ,COMMA arteries are red ,COMMA veins are blue .PERIOD 
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
However ,COMMA when we have a real patient on the table ,COMMA this is the same neck dissection -DASH -DASH not so easy to tell the difference between different structures .PERIOD 
We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society ,COMMA what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .PERIOD 
Well if cancer can be caught early ,COMMA enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out ,COMMA excised with surgery ,COMMA I don't care if it has this gene or that gene ,COMMA or if it has this protein or that protein ,COMMA it's in the jar .PERIOD 
It's done ,COMMA it's out ,COMMA you're cured of cancer .PERIOD 
This is how we excise cancers .PERIOD 
We do our best ,COMMA based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience ,COMMA we say ,COMMA you know what ,COMMA the cancer's gone .PERIOD 
We've made a good job .PERIOD We've taken it out .PERIOD 
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed ,COMMA what's left behind in the patient ,COMMA and then send those bits to the pathology lab .PERIOD 
In the meanwhile ,COMMA the patient's on the operating room table .PERIOD 
The nurses ,COMMA anesthesiologist ,COMMA the surgeon ,COMMA all the assistants are waiting around .PERIOD 
The pathologist takes that sample ,COMMA freezes it ,COMMA cuts it ,COMMA looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room .PERIOD 
And that may be <NUM> minutes later per piece .PERIOD 
So if you've sent three specimens ,COMMA it's an hour later .PERIOD 
And very often they say ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA points A and B are okay ,COMMA but point C ,COMMA you still have some residual cancer there .PERIOD 
Please go cut that piece out .PERIOD 
So we go back and we do that again ,COMMA and again .PERIOD 
And this whole process :COLON Okay you're done .PERIOD 
We think the entire tumor is out .PERIOD 
But very often several days later ,COMMA the patient's gone home ,COMMA we get a phone call :COLON I'm sorry ,COMMA once we looked at the final pathology ,COMMA once we looked at the final specimen ,COMMA we actually found that there's a couple other spots where the margins are positive .PERIOD 
There's still cancer in your patient .PERIOD 
So wouldn't it be better if we could really tell ,COMMA if the surgeon could really tell ,COMMA whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA the way that we're doing it ,COMMA we're still operating in the dark .PERIOD 
So in <NUM> ,COMMA during my surgical residency ,COMMA I had the great fortune to meet Dr .PERIOD Roger Chen ,COMMA who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer ,COMMA and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with .PERIOD 
The molecule they had developed had three parts .PERIOD 
The main part of it is the blue part ,COMMA polycation ,COMMA and it's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body .PERIOD 
So imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer ,COMMA everything's going to get lit up .PERIOD 
Nothing will be specific .PERIOD 
There's no specificity there .PERIOD 
So they added two additional components .PERIOD 
The first one is a polyanionic segment ,COMMA which basically acts as a non-stick backing like the back of a sticker .PERIOD 
So when those two are together ,COMMA the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down .PERIOD 
And the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors -DASH -DASH for example ,COMMA the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make .PERIOD 
So here in this situation ,COMMA if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye ,COMMA which is shown in green ,COMMA and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer ,COMMA normal tissue can't cut it .PERIOD 
The molecule passes through and gets excreted .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA in the presence of the tumor ,COMMA now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA boom ,COMMA the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent .PERIOD 
So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it .PERIOD 
Can you tell where the tumor is ?QUESTIONMARK 
I couldn't when I was working on this .PERIOD 
But here it is .PERIOD It's fluorescent .PERIOD 
Now it's green .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is .PERIOD 
We can tell in the operating room ,COMMA in the field ,COMMA at a molecular level ,COMMA where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .PERIOD 
And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright ,COMMA it actually can shine through tissue .PERIOD 
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .PERIOD 
In this movie ,COMMA you can see that the tumor is green .PERIOD 
There's actually normal muscle on top of it .PERIOD See that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I'm peeling that muscle away .PERIOD 
But even before I peel that muscle away ,COMMA you saw that there was a tumor underneath .PERIOD 
So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules .PERIOD 
That you can ,COMMA not only see the margins right there on a molecular level ,COMMA but you can see it even if it's not right on the top -DASH -DASH even if it's beyond your field of view .PERIOD 
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also .PERIOD 
Sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer ,COMMA melanoma .PERIOD 
Women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .PERIOD 
But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol ,COMMA the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer .PERIOD 
And then if that node has cancer ,COMMA the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection .PERIOD 
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer ,COMMA the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery .PERIOD 
But sentinel lymph node ,COMMA the way that we do it today ,COMMA is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go .PERIOD 
It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas .PERIOD 
You have to cut it out ,COMMA bring it back home ,COMMA cut it up ,COMMA look inside and say ,COMMA Oh yes ,COMMA it does have gas .PERIOD 
So that takes more time .PERIOD 
Patients are still on the operating room table .PERIOD 
Anesthesiologists ,COMMA surgeons are waiting around .PERIOD 
That takes time .PERIOD 
You see a lot of little ,COMMA roundish bumps there .PERIOD 
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others .PERIOD 
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold ?QUESTIONMARK 
That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside .PERIOD 
Well with our technology ,COMMA the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer .PERIOD 
I won't go into this very much ,COMMA but our technology ,COMMA besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence ,COMMA we can also use the same smart three-part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively .PERIOD 
The patient has cancer ,COMMA you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in .PERIOD 
Well you can see this on an MRI .PERIOD 
So in surgery ,COMMA it's important to know what to cut out .PERIOD 
But equally important is to preserve things that are important for function .PERIOD 
So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury .PERIOD 
And what I'm talking about are nerves .PERIOD 
In the setting of prostate cancer ,COMMA up to <NUM> percent of men after prostate cancer surgery may have urinary incontinence and erectile disfunction .PERIOD 
That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems -DASH -DASH and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery ,COMMA which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem ,COMMA and they are trying to avoid the nerves .PERIOD 
They are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature .PERIOD 
And they're known because somebody has decided to study them ,COMMA which means that we're still learning about where they are .PERIOD 
Crazy to think that we're having surgery ,COMMA we're trying to excise cancer ,COMMA we don't know where the cancer is .PERIOD 
We're trying to preserve nerves ;SEMICOLON we can't see where they are .PERIOD 
So I said ,COMMA wouldn't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence ?QUESTIONMARK 
And at first this didn't get a lot of support .PERIOD 
What's the problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
We haven't had that many complications .PERIOD 
And Roger helped me .PERIOD 
And he brought his whole team with him .PERIOD 
So there's that teamwork thing again .PERIOD 
And we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves .PERIOD 
And when we made a solution of this ,COMMA tagged with the fluorescence and injected in the body of a mouse ,COMMA their nerves literally glowed .PERIOD 
You can see where they are .PERIOD 
Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse ,COMMA and you can see that that big ,COMMA fat portion you can see very easily .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now ,COMMA there's actually very fine arborizations that can't really be seen .PERIOD 
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out .PERIOD 
We've been able to see every single nerve .PERIOD 
When we put these two probes together .. .PERIOD 
So here's a tumor .PERIOD 
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now you do .PERIOD 
What about the nerve that's going into this tumor ?QUESTIONMARK 
That white portion there is easy to see .PERIOD 
But what about the part that goes into the tumor ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you know where it's going ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now you do .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA we've come up with a way to stain tissue and color-code the surgical field .PERIOD 
This was a bit of a breakthrough .PERIOD 
I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery .PERIOD 
We published our results in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in Nature Biotechnology .PERIOD 
We received commentary in Discover magazine ,COMMA in The Economist .PERIOD 
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA Wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
What needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room .PERIOD 
The eventual goal is that we'll get this into patients .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA we've discovered that there's actually no straightforward mechanism to develop a molecule for one-time use .PERIOD 
Understandably ,COMMA the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs ,COMMA such as long-term daily medications .PERIOD 
We are focused on making this technology better .PERIOD 
We're focused on adding drugs ,COMMA adding growth factors ,COMMA killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue .PERIOD 
We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it .PERIOD 
I'd like to leave you with this final thought .PERIOD 
Successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .PERIOD 
It is not a sprint .PERIOD 
It is not an event for the solo runner .PERIOD 
Successful innovation is a team sport ,COMMA it's a relay race .PERIOD 
It requires one team for the breakthrough and another team to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Think about your day for a second .PERIOD 
You woke up ,COMMA felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door ,COMMA encountered new colleagues and had great discussions ,COMMA and felt in awe when you found something new .PERIOD 
But I bet there's something you didn't think about today -DASH -DASH something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all .PERIOD 
And that's that all the sensations ,COMMA feelings ,COMMA decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .PERIOD 
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -DASH -DASH a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh ,COMMA amorphous -DASH -DASH but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain ,COMMA and to see the intricacy of what lies within .PERIOD 
And they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons .PERIOD 
Now unlike a human-designed computer ,COMMA where there's a fairly small number of different parts -DASH -DASH we know how they work ,COMMA because we humans designed them -DASH -DASH the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells ,COMMA maybe tens of thousands .PERIOD 
They come in different shapes ;SEMICOLON they're made out of different molecules .PERIOD 
And they project and connect to different brain regions ,COMMA and they also change different ways in different disease states .PERIOD 
Let's make it concrete .PERIOD 
There's a class of cells ,COMMA a fairly small cell ,COMMA an inhibitory cell ,COMMA that quiets its neighbors .PERIOD 
It's one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia .PERIOD 
It's called the basket cell .PERIOD 
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .PERIOD 
New ones are being discovered everyday .PERIOD 
As just a second example :COLON these pyramidal cells ,COMMA large cells ,COMMA they can span a significant fraction of the brain .PERIOD 
They're excitatory .PERIOD 
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .PERIOD 
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .PERIOD 
And this process ,COMMA which takes just a millisecond or so ,COMMA happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your <NUM> billion cells ,COMMA as long as you live and think and feel .PERIOD 
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ideally ,COMMA we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies .PERIOD 
If we could turn them off ,COMMA then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for .PERIOD 
And that's a story I'm going to tell you about today .PERIOD 
And honestly ,COMMA where we've gone through over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off ,COMMA both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans .PERIOD 
Now before I tell you about the technology ,COMMA the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room ,COMMA if we live long enough ,COMMA will encounter ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA a brain disorder .PERIOD 
Already ,COMMA a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them ,COMMA and the numbers don't do it justice though .PERIOD 
These disorders -DASH -DASH schizophrenia ,COMMA Alzheimer's ,COMMA depression ,COMMA addiction -DASH -DASH they not only steal our time to live ,COMMA they change who we are .PERIOD 
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people .PERIOD 
And part of that's because we're bathing the brain in the chemical .PERIOD 
This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance .PERIOD 
That's also why ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA most of the drugs ,COMMA and not all ,COMMA on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too .PERIOD 
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain .PERIOD 
And for Parkinson's disease ,COMMA Cochlear implants ,COMMA these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder .PERIOD 
But electricity also will go in all directions -DASH -DASH the path of least resistance ,COMMA which is where that phrase ,COMMA in part ,COMMA comes from .PERIOD 
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .PERIOD 
So again ,COMMA we're sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control .PERIOD 
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?QUESTIONMARK 
So when I started in neuroscience <NUM> years ago ,COMMA I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist ,COMMA and the first thing I thought about was ,COMMA if these neurons are electrical devices ,COMMA all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance .PERIOD 
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell ,COMMA but not its neighbors ,COMMA that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells ,COMMA figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded .PERIOD 
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry .PERIOD 
Now how are we going to do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature ,COMMA which are able to convert light into electricity .PERIOD 
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells .PERIOD 
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow ,COMMA then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .PERIOD 
And their neighbors ,COMMA which don't have the molecule ,COMMA would not .PERIOD 
And to do that -DASH -DASH the brain doesn't feel pain -DASH -DASH you can put -DASH -DASH taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the Internet and communications and so on -DASH -DASH optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate ,COMMA in animal models for example ,COMMA in pre-clinical studies ,COMMA these neurons and to see what they do .PERIOD 
Around <NUM> ,COMMA in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth ,COMMA this vision came to fruition .PERIOD 
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild ,COMMA and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally .PERIOD 
And it senses light with a little eye-spot ,COMMA which works not unlike how our eye works .PERIOD 
In its membrane ,COMMA or its boundary ,COMMA it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity .PERIOD 
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .PERIOD 
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about .PERIOD 
When blue light hits it ,COMMA it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot ,COMMA and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery .PERIOD 
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons .PERIOD 
And because it's a protein ,COMMA it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism .PERIOD 
So all we've got to do is take that DNA ,COMMA put it into a gene therapy vector ,COMMA like a virus ,COMMA and put it into neurons .PERIOD 
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy ,COMMA and lots of viruses were coming along .PERIOD 
So this turned out to be very simple to do .PERIOD 
And early in the morning one day in the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA we gave it a try ,COMMA and it worked on the first try .PERIOD 
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .PERIOD 
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell ,COMMA like putting solar panels on a roof ,COMMA and the next thing you know ,COMMA you have a neuron which can be activated with light .PERIOD 
So this is very powerful .PERIOD 
One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors .PERIOD 
And you can do that ;SEMICOLON you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others .PERIOD 
And there's other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells .PERIOD 
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .PERIOD 
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do ,COMMA you can take a complex network ,COMMA use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .PERIOD 
And then when you shine light on the entire network ,COMMA just that cell type will be activated .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -DASH -DASH the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory .PERIOD 
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -DASH -DASH and they're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene ,COMMA of course -DASH -DASH and then flash blue light over the entire brain network ,COMMA just these cells are going to be driven .PERIOD 
And when the light turns off ,COMMA these cells go back to normal ,COMMA so they don't seem to be averse against that .PERIOD 
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do ,COMMA what their power is in computing in the brain ,COMMA but you can also use this to try to figure out -DASH -DASH well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells ,COMMA if indeed they're atrophied .PERIOD 
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we're using this ,COMMA both at the scientific ,COMMA clinical and pre-clinical levels .PERIOD 
One of the questions we've confronted is ,COMMA what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because if you could find those ,COMMA those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .PERIOD 
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .PERIOD 
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction .PERIOD 
So if we could figure out what cells they are ,COMMA we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against ,COMMA or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability .PERIOD 
So to do that ,COMMA we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group ,COMMA where one side of this little box ,COMMA if the animal goes there ,COMMA the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .PERIOD 
So if these cells can mediate reward ,COMMA the animal should go there more and more .PERIOD 
And so that's what happens .PERIOD 
This animal's going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there ,COMMA and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that .PERIOD 
And he'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .PERIOD 
These are the dopamine neurons ,COMMA which some of you may have heard about ,COMMA in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .PERIOD 
Now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA to drive learning .PERIOD 
Now we can generalize the idea .PERIOD 
Instead of one point in the brain ,COMMA we can devise devices that span the brain ,COMMA that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -DASH -DASH arrays of optical fibers ,COMMA each coupled to its own independent miniature light source .PERIOD 
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -DASH -DASH like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen .PERIOD 
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .PERIOD 
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -DASH -DASH a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .PERIOD 
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .PERIOD 
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -DASH -DASH where a tone ends with a brief shock .PERIOD 
The shock isn't painful ,COMMA but it's a little annoying .PERIOD 
Now the question is ,COMMA what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear ?QUESTIONMARK 
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear .PERIOD 
But we activate targets in the brain ,COMMA different ones ,COMMA using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide ,COMMA in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear .PERIOD 
And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now .PERIOD 
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex ,COMMA a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states .PERIOD 
And the animal's going to hear a tone -DASH -DASH and a flash of light occurred there .PERIOD 
There's no audio on this ,COMMA but you can see the animal's freezing .PERIOD 
This tone used to mean bad news .PERIOD 
And there's a little clock in the lower left-hand corner ,COMMA so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .PERIOD 
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later .PERIOD 
And the same tone is going to play ,COMMA and the light is going to flash again .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA there it goes .PERIOD Right now .PERIOD 
And now you can see ,COMMA just <NUM> minutes into the experiment ,COMMA that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory .PERIOD 
Now over the last couple of years ,COMMA we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .PERIOD 
If we could do that ,COMMA this could be extremely powerful .PERIOD 
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds ,COMMA you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they're embedded .PERIOD 
And we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -DASH -DASH every kingdom of life except for animals ,COMMA we see slightly differently .PERIOD 
And we found all sorts of molecules ,COMMA they're called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins ,COMMA that respond to green and yellow light .PERIOD 
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin .PERIOD 
Let's give an example of where we think this is going to go .PERIOD 
Consider ,COMMA for example ,COMMA a condition like epilepsy ,COMMA where the brain is overactive .PERIOD 
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment ,COMMA one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain .PERIOD 
But that's obviously irreversible ,COMMA and there could be side effects .PERIOD 
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time ,COMMA until the seizure dies away ,COMMA and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -DASH -DASH sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable state .PERIOD 
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light ,COMMA and we beam light in ,COMMA and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure ,COMMA we're hoping to be able to turn it off .PERIOD 
And so we don't have data to show you on this front ,COMMA but we're very excited about this .PERIOD 
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .PERIOD 
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson's deep-brain stimulators implanted .PERIOD 
There's another thing ,COMMA which is you've got to get these genes into cells .PERIOD 
And so far ,COMMA there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus .PERIOD 
There's one last elephant in the room ,COMMA the proteins themselves ,COMMA which come from algae and bacteria and fungi ,COMMA and all over the tree of life .PERIOD 
Most of us don't have fungi or algae in our brains ,COMMA so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?QUESTIONMARK 
Are the cells going to tolerate it ?QUESTIONMARK Will the immune system react ?QUESTIONMARK 
In its early days -DASH -DASH these have not been done on humans yet -DASH -DASH but we're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this ,COMMA and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light .PERIOD 
So it's early days ,COMMA to be upfront ,COMMA but we're excited about it .PERIOD 
I wanted to close with one story ,COMMA which we think could potentially be a clinical application .PERIOD 
Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors ,COMMA our light sensors that are in the back of our eye ,COMMA are gone .PERIOD 
Now let's zoom in on it here ,COMMA so we can see it in more detail .PERIOD 
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top ,COMMA and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom ,COMMA the ganglion cells ,COMMA relay the information to the brain ,COMMA where we see that as perception .PERIOD 
In many forms of blindness ,COMMA like retinitis pigmentosa ,COMMA or macular degeneration ,COMMA the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed .PERIOD 
Now how could you repair this ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored ,COMMA because there's nothing for the drug to bind to .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA light can still get into the eye .PERIOD 
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .PERIOD 
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras .PERIOD 
And because there's so many of these cells in the eye ,COMMA potentially ,COMMA they could be very high-resolution cameras .PERIOD 
So this is some work that we're doing .PERIOD 
It's being led by one of our collaborators ,COMMA Alan Horsager at USC ,COMMA and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience ,COMMA which is funded by the NIH .PERIOD 
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze .PERIOD 
It's a six-arm maze .PERIOD And there's a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move ,COMMA or he'll just sit there .PERIOD 
And the goal ,COMMA of course ,COMMA of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top port .PERIOD 
Now mice are smart ,COMMA so this mouse solves the maze eventually ,COMMA but he does a brute-force search .PERIOD 
He's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform .PERIOD 
So he's not using vision to do it .PERIOD 
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans .PERIOD 
And so we're being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach .PERIOD 
So how are we going to solve this ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide .PERIOD 
Light is converted to electricity on them .PERIOD 
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .PERIOD 
And now you can see ,COMMA the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again .PERIOD 
And to point out the power of this :COLON these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives .PERIOD 
To close ,COMMA I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology .PERIOD 
We're developing these tools ,COMMA but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world ,COMMA so people can study and try to treat different disorders .PERIOD 
And our hope is that ,COMMA by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them ,COMMA we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier ,COMMA practically none of which are cured ,COMMA and in the 21st century make them history .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Juan Enriquez :COLON So some of the stuff is a little dense .PERIOD 
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs ,COMMA and being able to target those specifically is a first step .PERIOD 
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors ,COMMA like an on/off switch .PERIOD 
Ed Boyden :COLON That's right .PERIOD 
Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD 
So with blue light ,COMMA we can drive information ,COMMA and it's in the form of a one .PERIOD 
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .PERIOD 
And in theory ,COMMA that means that ,COMMA as a mouse feels ,COMMA smells ,COMMA hears ,COMMA touches ,COMMA you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .PERIOD 
Sure ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD We're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings ,COMMA and use that to understand more about the brain .PERIOD 
Well that's something we're starting to work on very hard .PERIOD 
We're now working on some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too .PERIOD 
So we can record information and then drive information back in -DASH -DASH sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that might change a couple things .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Humans in the developed world spend more than <NUM> percent of their lives indoors ,COMMA where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye :COLON microorganisms .PERIOD 
Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us ,COMMA and some that are bad for us .PERIOD 
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems .PERIOD 
And they are brought inside by humans and other creatures .PERIOD 
The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans ,COMMA and with the human-built environment .PERIOD 
And today ,COMMA architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .PERIOD 
We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments ,COMMA like this building here -DASH -DASH environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering ,COMMA heating and air conditioning .PERIOD 
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors ,COMMA it's important to understand how this affects our health .PERIOD 
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center ,COMMA we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air .PERIOD 
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated ,COMMA which are the data points in the blue .PERIOD 
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated ,COMMA where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable ,COMMA but they made them operable for our study .PERIOD 
And we also sampled the outdoor air .PERIOD 
If you look at the x-axis of this graph ,COMMA you'll see that what we commonly want to do -DASH -DASH which is keeping the outdoors out -DASH -DASH we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .PERIOD 
So if you look at the green data points ,COMMA which is air that's outside ,COMMA you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity ,COMMA or variety of microbial types .PERIOD 
But if you look at the blue data points ,COMMA which is mechanically ventilated air ,COMMA it's not as diverse .PERIOD 
But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .PERIOD 
If you look at the y-axis of this graph ,COMMA you'll see that ,COMMA in the mechanically ventilated air ,COMMA you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen ,COMMA or germ ,COMMA than if you're outdoors .PERIOD 
So to understand why this was the case ,COMMA we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram ,COMMA which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .PERIOD 
The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart .PERIOD 
And the first things that you can see from this graph is ,COMMA if you look at the blue data points ,COMMA which are the mechanically ventilated air ,COMMA they're not simply a subset of the green data points ,COMMA which are the outdoor air .PERIOD 
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans .PERIOD 
It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth ,COMMA our spit .PERIOD 
And this is because we're all constantly shedding microbes .PERIOD 
So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .PERIOD 
And when you're outdoors ,COMMA that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt .PERIOD 
Why does this matter ?QUESTIONMARK 
It matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States .PERIOD 
And the model that we're working with in hospitals ,COMMA and also with many ,COMMA many different buildings ,COMMA is to keep the outdoors out .PERIOD 
And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health .PERIOD 
And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections ,COMMA or hospital-acquired infections ,COMMA this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices .PERIOD 
So just as we manage national parks ,COMMA where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others ,COMMA we're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .PERIOD 
And for this reason ,COMMA many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora .PERIOD 
And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I want to take you back basically to my hometown ,COMMA and to a picture of my hometown of the week that Emergence came out .PERIOD 
And it's a picture we've seen several times .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA Emergence was published on <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
I live right there in the West Village ,COMMA so the plume was luckily blowing west ,COMMA away from us .PERIOD 
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours -DASH -DASH we hadn't taken it from somebody else .PERIOD 
And one of the thoughts that I had dealing with these two separate emergences of a book and a baby ,COMMA and having this event happen so close -DASH -DASH that my first thought ,COMMA when I was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building ,COMMA was that I'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that I'd just written .PERIOD 
Because so much of that book was a celebration of the power and creative potential of density ,COMMA of largely urban density ,COMMA of connecting people and putting them together in one place ,COMMA and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together .PERIOD 
And it seemed to me looking at that -DASH -DASH that tower burning and then falling ,COMMA those towers burning and falling -DASH -DASH that in fact ,COMMA one of the lessons here was that density kills .PERIOD 
And that of all the technologies that were exploited to make that carnage come into being ,COMMA probably the single group of technologies that cost the most lives were those that enable <NUM> people to live in two buildings <NUM> stories above the ground .PERIOD 
If they hadn't been crowded -DASH -DASH you compare the loss of life at the Pentagon to the Twin Towers ,COMMA and you can see that very powerfully .PERIOD 
And so I started to think ,COMMA well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA density ,COMMA density -DASH -DASH I'm not sure if ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this was the right call .PERIOD 
And I kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days .PERIOD 
And then about two days later ,COMMA the wind started to change a little bit ,COMMA and you could sense that the air was not healthy .PERIOD 
And so even though there were no cars still in the West Village where we lived ,COMMA my wife sent me out to buy a ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a large air filter at the Bed Bath and Beyond ,COMMA which was located about <NUM> blocks away ,COMMA north .PERIOD 
And so I went out .PERIOD 
And I walked out ,COMMA and this really miraculous thing happened to me as I was walking north to buy this air filter ,COMMA which was that the streets were completely alive with people .PERIOD 
There was an incredible -DASH -DASH it was ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a beautiful day ,COMMA as it was for about a week after ,COMMA and the West Village had never seemed more lively .PERIOD 
I walked up along Hudson Street -DASH -DASH where Jane Jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what I was writing in Emergence -DASH -DASH past the White Horse Tavern ,COMMA that great old bar where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death ,COMMA and the Bleecker Street playground was filled with kids .PERIOD 
And all the people who lived in the neighborhood ,COMMA who owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood ,COMMA were all out there -DASH -DASH had them all open .PERIOD 
There were no cars ,COMMA so it seemed even better ,COMMA in some ways .PERIOD 
And it was a beautiful urban day ,COMMA and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .PERIOD 
The city was there .PERIOD 
All the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating -DASH -DASH they were all on display there on those streets .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA the power of the city -DASH -DASH we talked about cities as being centralized in space ,COMMA but what makes them so strong most of the time is they're decentralized in function .PERIOD 
They don't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail .PERIOD 
If they did ,COMMA it probably was right there at Ground Zero .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the emergency bunker was right there ,COMMA was destroyed by the attacks ,COMMA and obviously the damage done to the building and the lives .PERIOD 
But nonetheless ,COMMA just <NUM> blocks north ,COMMA two days later ,COMMA the city had never looked more alive .PERIOD 
If you'd gone into the minds of the people ,COMMA well ,COMMA you would have seen a lot of trauma ,COMMA and you would have seen a lot of heartache ,COMMA and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover .PERIOD 
So I took heart in seeing that .PERIOD 
So I wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well ,COMMA and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the Web is going right now .PERIOD 
The question that I found myself asking to people when I was talking about the book afterwards is -DASH -DASH when you've talked about emergent behavior ,COMMA when you've talked about collective intelligence ,COMMA the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask ,COMMA who builds a neighborhood ?QUESTIONMARK 
Who decides that Soho should have this personality and that the Latin Quarter should have this personality ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there are some kind of executive decisions ,COMMA but mostly the answer is -DASH -DASH everybody and nobody .PERIOD 
No single person is really the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood .PERIOD 
Same thing to the question of ,COMMA who was keeping the streets alive post-9/<NUM> in my neighborhood ?QUESTIONMARK 
The whole system kind of working on it ,COMMA and everybody contributing a small little part .PERIOD 
And this is increasingly what we're starting to see on the Web in a bunch of interesting ways -DASH -DASH most of which weren't around ,COMMA actually ,COMMA except in very experimental things ,COMMA when I was writing Emergence and when the book came out .PERIOD 
I think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that's starting to emerge online right now .PERIOD 
And the old one looked like this .PERIOD 
This is not the future King of England ,COMMA although it looks like it .PERIOD 
It's some guy ,COMMA it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested ,COMMA if you look at the bottom ,COMMA in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and my hometown -DASH -DASH those are his links .PERIOD 
But nothing really says this model of interactivity -DASH -DASH which was so exciting and captures the real ,COMMA the Web Zeitgeist of <NUM> -DASH -DASH than Click here for a picture of my dog .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I don't want to belittle that .PERIOD That ,COMMA in a sense -DASH -DASH to reference what Jeff was talking about yesterday -DASH -DASH that was ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the explosion of interest in the Web :COLON that you could put up a link ,COMMA and somebody could click on it ,COMMA and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go .PERIOD 
There's one person putting up the link ,COMMA and there's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not .PERIOD 
The new model is much more like this ,COMMA and we've already seen a couple of references to this .PERIOD 
This is what happens when you search Steven Johnson on Google .PERIOD 
There's some theoretical physicist at MIT named Steven Johnson who has dropped two spots ,COMMA I'm happy to say .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA I'll look at a couple of things like this ,COMMA but Google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing .PERIOD 
It's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you gaze .PERIOD 
Because effectively ,COMMA what's happening here ,COMMA what's creating this page ,COMMA obviously -DASH -DASH and we all know this ,COMMA but it's worth just thinking about it -DASH -DASH is not some person deciding that I am the number one answer for Steven Johnson ,COMMA but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it ,COMMA and Google just sitting there and running the numbers .PERIOD 
So there's this collective decision-making that's going on .PERIOD 
This page is effectively ,COMMA collectively authored by the Web ,COMMA and Google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA they're more innovative -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA Google's pretty innovative -DASH -DASH but there are some new twists on this .PERIOD 
There's this incredibly interesting new site -DASH -DASH Technorati -DASH -DASH that's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these .PERIOD 
And these are looking in the blog world and the world of weblogs .PERIOD 
He's analyzed basically all the weblogs out there that he's tracking .PERIOD 
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs ,COMMA and so you have kind of an authority -DASH -DASH a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it .PERIOD 
And so at any given time ,COMMA on any given page on the Web ,COMMA actually ,COMMA you can say ,COMMA what does the weblog community think about this page ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you can get a list .PERIOD 
This is what they think about my site ;SEMICOLON it's ranked by blog authority .PERIOD 
You can also rank it by the latest posts .PERIOD 
So when I was talking in Emergence ,COMMA I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that ,COMMA basically ,COMMA you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them .PERIOD 
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking ,COMMA you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA something like Technorati is supplying that .PERIOD 
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger ,COMMA where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -DASH -DASH there's nothing artificial .PERIOD 
He has this line where he says ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you're going to put up a link there ,COMMA if you see a link ,COMMA somebody decided to put it there .PERIOD 
And he says ,COMMA the link to one site didn't just grow on the other page like a tree fungus .PERIOD 
I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati on the right-hand side of my page ,COMMA and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes .PERIOD 
I wouldn't really be directly in control of it .PERIOD 
So it's much closer ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA to a data fungus ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA wrapped around that page ,COMMA than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what you're having here is basically a global brain that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking .PERIOD 
And there are all these interesting tools .PERIOD 
Google does the Google Zeitgeist ,COMMA which looks at search requests to test what's going on ,COMMA what people are interested in ,COMMA and they publish it with lots of fun graphs .PERIOD 
And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google ,COMMA so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing .PERIOD 
There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist ,COMMA which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for Britney Spears pictures ,COMMA which is not necessarily news .PERIOD 
The Columbia blows up ,COMMA suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we should expect to see that .PERIOD 
So the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain ,COMMA that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream -DASH -DASH the question is ,COMMA are you finding out something new ?QUESTIONMARK 
And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share which is basically ,COMMA you take an abstract term ,COMMA and you search Google for that term ,COMMA and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name .PERIOD 
So basically ,COMMA the number of pages that mention this term ,COMMA that also mention this page ,COMMA the percentage of those pages is that person's Google Share of that term .PERIOD 
So you can do kind of interesting contests .PERIOD 
Like for instance ,COMMA this is a Google Share of the TED Conference .PERIOD 
So Richard Saul Wurman has about a <NUM> percent Google Share of the TED conference .PERIOD 
Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -DASH -DASH but with a bullet ,COMMA I might add .PERIOD 
But the interesting thing is ,COMMA you can broaden the search a little bit .PERIOD 
And it turns out ,COMMA actually ,COMMA that <NUM> percent is the Mola mola fish .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA that's not true .PERIOD 
I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide of the Mola mola fish .PERIOD 
I also did -DASH -DASH and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel -DASH -DASH but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection .PERIOD 
So right here -DASH -DASH now this is a big category ,COMMA you have smaller percentages ,COMMA so this is <NUM> percent -DASH -DASH Dan Dennett ,COMMA who'll be speaking shortly .PERIOD 
Right below him ,COMMA <NUM> percent ,COMMA Steven Pinker .PERIOD 
So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there .PERIOD 
So Gary Bauer is not too far behind -DASH -DASH has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection .PERIOD 
And right behind him is L .PERIOD Ron Hubbard .PERIOD So -DASH -DASH you can see we're in the ascot ,COMMA which is always good .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA Chris ,COMMA that would've been a really good panel ,COMMA I think ,COMMA right there .PERIOD 
Hubbard apparently started to reach ,COMMA but besides that ,COMMA I think it would be good next year .PERIOD 
Another quick thing -DASH -DASH this is a slightly different thing ,COMMA but this analysis some of you may have seen .PERIOD 
It just came out .PERIOD This is bursty words ,COMMA looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses .PERIOD 
So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere ,COMMA so they're kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA memes that start taking off ,COMMA that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before .PERIOD 
So the first one is -DASH -DASH these are the bursty words around 1860s -DASH -DASH slaves ,COMMA emancipation ,COMMA slavery ,COMMA rebellion ,COMMA Kansas .PERIOD 
That's Britney Spears .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA OK ,COMMA interesting .PERIOD 
<NUM> -DASH -DASH relief ,COMMA depression ,COMMA recovery banks .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA right at the center of the Reagan years -DASH -DASH that's ,COMMA we're ,COMMA there's ,COMMA we've ,COMMA it's .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there's one way to interpret this ,COMMA which is to say that emancipation and depression and recovery all have a lot of syllables .PERIOD 
So you know ,COMMA you can actually download -DASH -DASH it's hard to remember those .PERIOD 
But seriously ,COMMA actually ,COMMA what you can see there ,COMMA in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise ,COMMA is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country and shifting to a much more intimate ,COMMA much more folksy ,COMMA much more telegenic -DASH -DASH contracting all those verbs .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA <NUM> years before it was still ,COMMA Ask not what you can do ,COMMA but with Reagan ,COMMA it's ,COMMA that's where ,COMMA there's Nancy and I ,COMMA that kind of language .PERIOD 
And so something we kind of knew ,COMMA but you didn't actually notice syntactically what he was doing .PERIOD 
The question now -DASH -DASH and this is the really interesting question -DASH -DASH is ,COMMA what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now in the overall Web ecosystem -DASH -DASH and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of at the cutting edge .PERIOD 
And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system .PERIOD 
Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago ,COMMA and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs .PERIOD 
It follows a power law ,COMMA so that there are a few extremely well-linked to ,COMMA popular blogs ,COMMA and a long tail of blogs with very few links .PERIOD 
So <NUM> percent of the blogs get <NUM> percent of the links .PERIOD 
Now this is a very interesting thing .PERIOD 
And so the question is ,COMMA Why is this happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not being imposed by fiat from above .PERIOD 
It's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what's great about it is that people are working on -DASH -DASH within seconds of Clay publishing this piece ,COMMA people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing .PERIOD 
And basically ,COMMA the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first-mover advantage .PERIOD 
if you're the first site there ,COMMA everybody links to you .PERIOD 
If you're the second site there ,COMMA most people link to you .PERIOD 
And so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links ,COMMA and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future ,COMMA and then you get this kind of shape .PERIOD 
And so what Dave Sifry at Technorati started working on ,COMMA literally as Shirky started -DASH -DASH after he published his piece -DASH -DASH was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers .PERIOD 
And he started looking at interesting newcomers that don't have a lot of links ,COMMA that suddenly get a bunch of links in the last <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
So in a sense ,COMMA bursty weblogs coming from new voices .PERIOD 
So he's working on a tool right there that can actually change the overall system .PERIOD 
And it creates a kind of planned emergence .PERIOD 
You're not totally in control ,COMMA but you're changing the underlying rules in interesting ways because you have an end result which is maybe a more democratic spread of voices .PERIOD 
So the most amazing thing about this -DASH -DASH and I'll end on this note -DASH -DASH is ,COMMA most emergent systems ,COMMA most self-organizing systems are not made up of component parts that are capable of looking at the overall pattern and changing their behavior based on whether they like the pattern or not .PERIOD 
So the most wonderful thing ,COMMA I think ,COMMA about this whole debate about power laws and software that could change it is the fact that we're having the conversation .PERIOD 
I hope it continues here .PERIOD 
Thanks a lot .PERIOD

And so the question that we might not have birds became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm not a scientist ,COMMA that'll be really clear .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be .PERIOD 
What is a bird ?QUESTIONMARK 
It comes in California with a warning -DASH -DASH This product contains chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm .PERIOD 
This is a bird .PERIOD 
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think we have a design problem .PERIOD 
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called The Monticello Dialogues on NPR ,COMMA and sent me this as a thank you note -DASH -DASH We realize that design is a signal of intention ,COMMA but it also has to occur within a world ,COMMA and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence ,COMMA and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs in which we design ,COMMA we ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA need to go to the primordial condition to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet ,COMMA and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there ,COMMA because the news is the news of abundance ,COMMA and not the news of limits ,COMMA and I think as our culture tortures itself now with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear ,COMMA we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent ,COMMA driven by the sun ,COMMA and start to imagine what that would be like to share .PERIOD 
That was one sentence .PERIOD 
Henry James would be proud .PERIOD 
This is -DASH -DASH I put it down at the bottom ,COMMA but that was extemporaneous ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD 
The fundamental issue is that ,COMMA for me ,COMMA design is the first signal of human intentions .PERIOD 
So what are our intentions ,COMMA and what would our intentions be -DASH -DASH if we wake up in the morning ,COMMA we have designs on the world -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA what would our intention be as a species now that we're the dominant species ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate ,COMMA because really ,COMMA dominion is implicit in stewardship -DASH -DASH because how could you dominate something you had killed ?QUESTIONMARK 
And stewardship's implicit in dominion ,COMMA because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it .PERIOD 
So the question is ,COMMA what is the first question for designers ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA as guardians -DASH -DASH let's say the state ,COMMA for example ,COMMA which reserves the right to kill ,COMMA the right to be duplicitous and so on -DASH -DASH the question we're asking the guardian at this point is are we meant ,COMMA how are we meant ,COMMA to secure local societies ,COMMA create world peace and save the environment ?QUESTIONMARK 
But I don't know that that's the common debate .PERIOD 
Commerce ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA is relatively quick ,COMMA essentially creative ,COMMA highly effective and efficient ,COMMA and fundamentally honest ,COMMA because we can't exchange value for very long if we don't trust each other .PERIOD 
So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work ,COMMA but the question we bring to it is ,COMMA how do we love all the children of all species for all time ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so we start our designs with that question .PERIOD 
Because what we realize today is that modern culture appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy .PERIOD 
If we come here and say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I didn't intend to cause global warming on the way here ,COMMA and we say ,COMMA That's not part of my plan ,COMMA then we realize it's part of our de facto plan .PERIOD 
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan .PERIOD 
And I was at the White House for President Bush ,COMMA meeting with every federal department and agency ,COMMA and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan .PERIOD 
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act ,COMMA then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as ,COMMA Brain death for all children .PERIOD No child left behind .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA how many federal officials are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families ?QUESTIONMARK 
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful ,COMMA then you're just moving chess pieces around ,COMMA if you don't know you're taking the king .PERIOD 
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility ,COMMA reflect on this -DASH -DASH it took us <NUM> years to put wheels on our luggage .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as Kevin Kelly pointed out ,COMMA there is no endgame .PERIOD 
Our goal is a delightfully diverse ,COMMA safe ,COMMA healthy and just world ,COMMA with clean air ,COMMA clean water ,COMMA soil and power -DASH -DASH economically ,COMMA equitably ,COMMA ecologically and elegantly enjoyed ,COMMA period .PERIOD 
What don't you like about this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which part of this don't you like ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we realized we want full diversity ,COMMA even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said when asked what it was like to be President of France .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA What do you think it's like trying to run a country with <NUM> kinds of cheese ?QUESTIONMARK 
But at the same time ,COMMA we realize that our products are not safe and healthy .PERIOD 
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of Alzheimer's later in life .PERIOD 
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?QUESTIONMARK 
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations .PERIOD 
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes .PERIOD 
Clean soil is a critical problem -DASH -DASH the nitrification ,COMMA the dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico .PERIOD 
A fundamental issue that's not being addressed .PERIOD 
We've seen the first form of solar energy that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind here in the Great Plains ,COMMA and so that hegemony is leaving .PERIOD 
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC ,COMMA they asked him ,COMMA When will we see the end of the age of oil ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't know if you remember his answer ,COMMA but it was ,COMMA The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones .PERIOD 
We see that companies acting ethically in this world are outperforming those that don't .PERIOD 
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect .PERIOD 
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles ,COMMA sent to China .PERIOD 
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous ,COMMA release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment ,COMMA which is from copper .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA we see great signs of hope .PERIOD 
He has given eyesight to two million people for free .PERIOD 
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again because of the contaminants of the coatings -DASH -DASH bismuth ,COMMA antimony ,COMMA copper and so on .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA we're working with Berkshire Hathaway ,COMMA Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet ,COMMA the largest carpet company in the world .PERIOD 
We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable ,COMMA down to the parts per million .PERIOD 
The upper is Nylon <NUM> that can go back to caprolactam ,COMMA the bottom ,COMMA a polyolephine -DASH -DASH infinitely recyclable thermoplastic .PERIOD 
Now if I was a bird ,COMMA the building on my left is a liability .PERIOD 
The building on my right ,COMMA which is our corporate campus for The Gap with an ancient meadow ,COMMA is an asset -DASH -DASH its nesting grounds .PERIOD 
Here's where I come from .PERIOD I grew up in Hong Kong ,COMMA with six million people in <NUM> square miles .PERIOD 
During the dry season ,COMMA we had four hours of water every fourth day .PERIOD 
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for <NUM> centuries .PERIOD 
You can't farm the same piece of ground for <NUM> centuries without understanding nutrient flow .PERIOD 
I went to Yale for graduate school ,COMMA studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier ,COMMA affectionately known in our business as Brutalism .PERIOD 
If we look at the world of architecture ,COMMA we see with Mies' <NUM> tower for Berlin ,COMMA the question might be ,COMMA Well ,COMMA where's the sun ?QUESTIONMARK 
And this might have worked in Berlin ,COMMA but we built it in Houston ,COMMA and the windows are all closed .PERIOD And with most products appearing not to have been designed for indoor use ,COMMA this is actually a vertical gas chamber .PERIOD 
When I went to Yale ,COMMA we had the first energy crisis ,COMMA and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland as a student ,COMMA which I then built -DASH -DASH which would give you a sense of my ambition .PERIOD 
And Richard Meier ,COMMA who was one of my teachers ,COMMA kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism ,COMMA and he would say ,COMMA Bill ,COMMA you've got to understand- -DASH -DASH solar energy has nothing to do with architecture .PERIOD 
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA we did the first so-called green office in America for Environmental Defense .PERIOD 
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA They're proprietary ,COMMA they're legal ,COMMA go away .PERIOD 
The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time was sponsored by R.J .PERIOD Reynolds Tobacco Company ,COMMA and it was to prove there was no danger from secondhand smoke in the workplace .PERIOD 
Remember we used to throw things away ,COMMA and we'd point to away ?QUESTIONMARK 
And yet ,COMMA NOAA has now shown us ,COMMA for example -DASH -DASH you see that little blue thing above Hawaii ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's the Pacific Gyre .PERIOD 
It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists ,COMMA and they found six times as much plastic as plankton .PERIOD 
When asked ,COMMA they said ,COMMA It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush .PERIOD 
Perhaps that's away .PERIOD 
So we're looking for the design rules of this -DASH -DASH this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world ,COMMA Irian Jaya ,COMMA <NUM> species of tree ,COMMA and we described this in the book ,COMMA Cradle to Cradle .PERIOD 
The book itself is a polymer .PERIOD It is not a tree .PERIOD 
That's the name of the first chapter -DASH -DASH This Book is Not a Tree .PERIOD 
Because in poetics ,COMMA as Margaret Atwood pointed out ,COMMA we write our history on the skin of fish with the blood of bears .PERIOD 
And with so much polymer ,COMMA what we really need is technical nutrition ,COMMA and to use something as elegant as a tree -DASH -DASH imagine this design assignment :COLON Design something that makes oxygen ,COMMA sequesters carbon ,COMMA fixes nitrogen ,COMMA distills water ,COMMA accrues solar energy as fuel ,COMMA makes complex sugars and food ,COMMA creates microclimates ,COMMA changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA why don't we knock that down and write on it ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA we're looking at the same criteria as most people -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA can I afford it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does it work ?QUESTIONMARK Do I like it ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda ,COMMA and I come from Charlottesville ,COMMA where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson .PERIOD 
We're adding life ,COMMA liberty and the pursuit of happiness .PERIOD 
They get fit together ,COMMA and then they compete .PERIOD 
The Williams sisters compete -DASH -DASH one wins Wimbledon .PERIOD 
And the Chinese government has now -DASH -DASH I work with the Chinese government now -DASH -DASH has taken this up .PERIOD 
We're also looking at survival of the fittest ,COMMA not in just competition terms in our modern context of destroy the other or beat them to the ground ,COMMA but really to fit together and build niches and have growth that is good .PERIOD 
But if we look at asphalt as our growth ,COMMA then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system .PERIOD 
So when we see E equals mc squared come along ,COMMA from a poet's perspective ,COMMA we see energy as physics ,COMMA chemistry as mass ,COMMA and all of a sudden ,COMMA you get this biology .PERIOD 
And we have plenty of energy ,COMMA so we'll solve that problem ,COMMA but the biology problem's tricky ,COMMA because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge ,COMMA we will never be able to recover that .PERIOD 
And as Francis Crick pointed out ,COMMA nine years after discovering DNA with Mr .PERIOD Watson ,COMMA that life itself has to have growth as a precondition -DASH -DASH it has to have free energy ,COMMA sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals .PERIOD 
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing ,COMMA and we want growth ,COMMA we want free energy from sunlight and we want an open metabolism for chemicals .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA the question becomes not growth or no growth ,COMMA but what do you want to grow ?QUESTIONMARK 
So instead of just growing destruction ,COMMA we want to grow the things that we might enjoy ,COMMA and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese .PERIOD 
So therefore ,COMMA we have these two metabolisms ,COMMA and I worked with a German chemist ,COMMA Michael Braungart ,COMMA and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms .PERIOD 
The biological one I'm sure you understand ,COMMA but also the technical one ,COMMA where we take materials and put them into closed cycles .PERIOD 
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition .PERIOD 
Biological nutrition can supply about <NUM> million humans ,COMMA which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton ,COMMA the world would run out of cork and dry up .PERIOD 
So we need materials in closed cycles ,COMMA but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million for cancer ,COMMA birth defects ,COMMA mutagenic effects ,COMMA disruption of our immune systems ,COMMA biodegradation ,COMMA persistence ,COMMA heavy metal content ,COMMA knowledge of how we're making them and their production and so on .PERIOD 
Our first product was a textile where we analyzed <NUM> chemicals in the textile industry .PERIOD 
Using those intellectual filters ,COMMA we eliminated [<NUM>.] We were left with <NUM> chemicals .PERIOD 
We have since databased the <NUM> most commonly used chemicals in human manufacturing ,COMMA and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks .PERIOD 
So designers all over the world can analyze their products down to the parts per million for human and ecological health .PERIOD 
We've developed a protocol so that companies can send these same messages all the way through their supply chains ,COMMA because when we asked most companies we work with -DASH -DASH about a trillion dollars -DASH -DASH and say ,COMMA Where does your stuff come from ?QUESTIONMARK They say ,COMMA Suppliers .PERIOD 
And where does it go ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we need some help there .PERIOD 
So the biological nutrients ,COMMA the first fabrics -DASH -DASH the water coming out was clean enough to drink .PERIOD 
Technical nutrients -DASH -DASH this is for Shaw Carpet ,COMMA infinitely reusable carpet .PERIOD 
Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet .PERIOD 
Shoes for Nike ,COMMA where the uppers are polyesters ,COMMA infinitely recyclable ,COMMA the bottoms are biodegradable soles .PERIOD 
Wear your old shoes in ,COMMA your new shoes out .PERIOD 
There is no finish line .PERIOD 
Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water .PERIOD 
Here's a building for The Gap ,COMMA where the ancient grasses of San Bruno ,COMMA California ,COMMA are on the roof .PERIOD 
And this is our project for Ford Motor Company .PERIOD 
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn .PERIOD 
This is obviously a color photograph .PERIOD 
These are our tools .PERIOD These are how we sold it to Ford .PERIOD 
We saved Ford <NUM> million dollars doing it this way ,COMMA day one ,COMMA which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus at a four percent margin of an order for <NUM> million dollars worth of cars .PERIOD 
Here it is .PERIOD It's the world's largest green roof ,COMMA <NUM> and a half acres .PERIOD 
This is the roof ,COMMA saving money ,COMMA and this is the first species to arrive here .PERIOD These are killdeer .PERIOD 
They showed up in five days .PERIOD 
And we now have 350-pound auto workers learning bird songs on the Internet .PERIOD 
We're developing now protocols for cities -DASH -DASH that's the home of technical nutrients .PERIOD 
The country -DASH -DASH the home of biological .PERIOD And putting them together .PERIOD 
And so I will finish by showing you a new city we're designing for the Chinese government .PERIOD 
We did a mass energy balance -DASH -DASH if they use brick ,COMMA they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal .PERIOD 
They'll have cities with no energy and no food .PERIOD 
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding -DASH -DASH here's Madam Deng Nan ,COMMA Deng Xiaoping's daughter -DASH -DASH for China to adopt cradle to cradle .PERIOD 
Because if they toxify themselves ,COMMA being the lowest-cost producer ,COMMA send it to the lowest-cost distribution -DASH -DASH Wal-Mart -DASH -DASH and then we send them all our money ,COMMA what we'll discover is that we have what ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA when I was a student ,COMMA was called mutually assured destruction .PERIOD 
Now we do it by molecule .PERIOD These are our cities .PERIOD 
We're building a new city next to this city ;SEMICOLON look at that landscape .PERIOD 
This is the site .PERIOD 
We don't normally do green fields ,COMMA but this one is about to be built ,COMMA so they brought us in to intercede .PERIOD 
This is their plan .PERIOD 
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape .PERIOD 
And they brought us in and said ,COMMA What would you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is what they would end up with ,COMMA which is another color photograph .PERIOD 
So this is the existing site ,COMMA so this is what it looks like now ,COMMA and here's our proposal .PERIOD 
So the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully .PERIOD 
We studied the biota ,COMMA the ancient biota ,COMMA the current farming and the protocols .PERIOD 
We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city will have fresh air ,COMMA fresh water and direct sunlight in every single apartment at some point during the day .PERIOD 
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure .PERIOD 
We lay out the building areas .PERIOD 
The transportation is all very simple ,COMMA everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility .PERIOD 
We have a 24-hour street ,COMMA so that there's always a place that's alive .PERIOD 
The waste systems all connect .PERIOD 
If you flush a toilet ,COMMA your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants ,COMMA which are sold as assets ,COMMA not liabilities .PERIOD 
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas ?QUESTIONMARK 
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations .PERIOD 
So this is -DASH -DASH these are fertilizer gas plants .PERIOD 
The solar power of all the factory centers and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city .PERIOD 
And this is the concept for the top of the city .PERIOD 
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs .PERIOD 
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next .PERIOD 
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors .PERIOD 
And so this is the existing city ,COMMA and this is the new city .PERIOD 
Humans have long held a fascination for the human brain .PERIOD 
We chart it ,COMMA we've described it ,COMMA we've drawn it ,COMMA we've mapped it .PERIOD 
Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -DASH -DASH think Google Maps ,COMMA think GPS -DASH -DASH the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .PERIOD 
So let's take a look at the brain .PERIOD 
Most people ,COMMA when they first look at a fresh human brain ,COMMA they say ,COMMA It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain .PERIOD 
Typically ,COMMA what you're looking at is a fixed brain .PERIOD It's gray .PERIOD 
And this outer layer ,COMMA this is the vasculature ,COMMA which is incredible ,COMMA around a human brain .PERIOD 
This is the blood vessels .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the blood pumped from your heart ,COMMA is servicing this one organ .PERIOD 
That's basically ,COMMA if you hold two fists together ,COMMA it's just slightly larger than the two fists .PERIOD 
Scientists ,COMMA sort of at the end of the 20th century ,COMMA learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA they can see in the back part of the brain ,COMMA which is just turning around there .PERIOD 
There's the cerebellum ;SEMICOLON that's keeping you upright right now .PERIOD 
It's keeping me standing .PERIOD It's involved in coordinated movement .PERIOD 
On the side here ,COMMA this is temporal cortex .PERIOD 
This is the area where primary auditory processing -DASH -DASH so you're hearing my words ,COMMA you're sending it up into higher language processing centers .PERIOD 
Towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought ,COMMA decision making -DASH -DASH it's the last to mature in late adulthood .PERIOD 
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on .PERIOD 
It's the place where you're deciding right now you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner .PERIOD 
So if you take a deeper look at the brain ,COMMA one of the things ,COMMA if you look at it in cross-section ,COMMA what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there .PERIOD 
But there's actually a lot of structure there .PERIOD 
It's cells and it's wires all wired together .PERIOD 
So about a hundred years ago ,COMMA some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells .PERIOD 
And that's shown here in the the very light blue .PERIOD 
You can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .PERIOD 
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform .PERIOD You see a lot more structure there .PERIOD 
So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .PERIOD 
It's one continuous processing unit ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
But you can also see things underneath there as well .PERIOD 
And all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through .PERIOD 
So there's about <NUM> billion neurons in our brain .PERIOD 
And as you can see ,COMMA they're very non-uniformly distributed .PERIOD 
And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA as I mentioned before ,COMMA since we can now start to map brain function ,COMMA we can start to tie these into the individual cells .PERIOD 
So let's take a deeper look .PERIOD 
Let's look at neurons .PERIOD 
So as I mentioned ,COMMA there are <NUM> billion neurons .PERIOD 
There are also these smaller cells as you'll see .PERIOD 
These are support cells -DASH -DASH astrocytes glia .PERIOD 
And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input .PERIOD 
They're storing it ,COMMA they're processing it .PERIOD 
Each neuron is connected via synapses to up to <NUM> other neurons in your brain .PERIOD 
And each neuron itself is largely unique .PERIOD 
The unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry .PERIOD 
These are proteins .PERIOD 
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .PERIOD 
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .PERIOD 
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level ,COMMA all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes .PERIOD 
We each have <NUM> pairs of chromosomes .PERIOD 
We get one from mom ,COMMA one from dad .PERIOD 
And on these chromosomes are roughly <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
They're encoded in the DNA .PERIOD 
And the nature of a given cell driving its underlying biochemistry is dictated by which of these <NUM> genes are turned on and at what level they're turned on .PERIOD 
And so our project is seeking to look at this readout ,COMMA understanding which of these <NUM> genes is turned on .PERIOD 
So in order to undertake such a project ,COMMA we obviously need brains .PERIOD 
So we sent our lab technician out .PERIOD 
We were seeking normal human brains .PERIOD 
What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office .PERIOD 
This a place where the dead are brought in .PERIOD 
We are seeking normal human brains .PERIOD 
There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains .PERIOD 
We want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain ,COMMA no history of psychiatric disease ,COMMA no drugs on board -DASH -DASH we do a toxicology workup .PERIOD 
And we're very careful about the brains that we do take .PERIOD 
We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue ,COMMA we can get consent to take the tissue within <NUM> hours of time of death .PERIOD 
One side note on the collection of brains :COLON because of the way that we collect ,COMMA and because we require consent ,COMMA we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .PERIOD 
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life .PERIOD 
And men are much more likely to have their significant other ,COMMA spouse ,COMMA give consent than the other way around .PERIOD 
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what's called an MR .PERIOD 
This is magnetic resonance imaging -DASH -DASH MRI .PERIOD 
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data .PERIOD 
So we collect this MR .PERIOD 
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .PERIOD 
The next thing we do is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging .PERIOD 
This maps the large cabling in the brain .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
The brain is removed from the skull ,COMMA and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices .PERIOD 
And those are frozen solid ,COMMA and they're shipped to Seattle .PERIOD 
And in Seattle ,COMMA we take these -DASH -DASH this is a whole human hemisphere -DASH -DASH and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer .PERIOD 
There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide .PERIOD 
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it ,COMMA and we scan it .PERIOD 
And then what we get is our first mapping .PERIOD 
So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments .PERIOD 
You could consider this state boundaries ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA those pretty broad outlines .PERIOD 
From this ,COMMA we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces ,COMMA which then we can put on a smaller cryostat .PERIOD 
And this is just showing this here -DASH -DASH this frozen tissue ,COMMA and it's being cut .PERIOD 
This is <NUM> microns thin ,COMMA so this is about a baby hair's width .PERIOD 
And remember ,COMMA it's frozen .PERIOD 
And so you can see here ,COMMA old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .PERIOD 
We take a microscope slide .PERIOD 
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide .PERIOD 
This will then go onto a robot that's going to apply one of those stains to it .PERIOD 
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this .PERIOD 
So again this is what they can see under the microscope .PERIOD 
You can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places .PERIOD 
And from there it's routine .PERIOD They understand where to make these assignments .PERIOD 
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas .PERIOD 
This is a more detailed map .PERIOD 
Our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what's called laser scanning microdissection .PERIOD 
So the technician takes the instructions .PERIOD 
They scribe along a place there .PERIOD 
You can see that blue dot there cutting .PERIOD And that tissue falls off .PERIOD 
You can see on the microscope slide here ,COMMA that's what's happening in real time .PERIOD 
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue .PERIOD 
We take that tissue ,COMMA we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology ,COMMA and then we put a florescent tag on it .PERIOD 
We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .PERIOD 
This has roughly <NUM> elements on it ,COMMA so we repeatedly measure various genes of the <NUM> genes in the genome .PERIOD 
Now we do this over and over again ,COMMA this process for any given brain .PERIOD 
We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain .PERIOD 
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .PERIOD 
It's involved in learning and memory .PERIOD 
And it contributes to about <NUM> samples of those thousand samples .PERIOD 
So each sample gets us about <NUM> data points with repeat measurements ,COMMA a thousand samples .PERIOD 
We've done right now two human brains-worth of data .PERIOD 
We've put all of that together into one thing ,COMMA and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like .PERIOD 
It's basically a large data set of information that's all freely available to any scientist around the world .PERIOD 
They don't even have to log in to come use this tool ,COMMA mine this data ,COMMA find interesting things out with this .PERIOD 
So here's the modalities that we put together .PERIOD 
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before .PERIOD 
Here's the MR .PERIOD It provides the framework .PERIOD 
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn ,COMMA it allows you to zoom in ,COMMA it allows you to highlight individual structures .PERIOD 
But most importantly ,COMMA we're now mapping into this anatomic framework ,COMMA which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on .PERIOD 
So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree .PERIOD 
And each gene gives us a fingerprint .PERIOD 
And remember that we've assayed all the <NUM> genes in the genome and have all of that data available .PERIOD 
So what can scientists learn about this data ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves .PERIOD 
There's some basic things that you would want to understand .PERIOD 
Two great examples are drugs ,COMMA Prozac and Wellbutrin .PERIOD 
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants .PERIOD 
Now remember ,COMMA we're assaying genes .PERIOD 
Proteins are targets for drugs .PERIOD 
So if you want to understand the action of drugs ,COMMA you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to ,COMMA and also in the ways you don't want them to .PERIOD 
In the side effect profile ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA you want to see where those genes are turned on .PERIOD 
And for the first time ,COMMA we can actually do that .PERIOD 
We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too .PERIOD 
So now we can look throughout the brain .PERIOD 
We can see this unique fingerprint .PERIOD 
And we get confirmation .PERIOD 
We get confirmation that ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA the gene is turned on -DASH -DASH for something like Prozac ,COMMA in serotonergic structures ,COMMA things that are already known be affected -DASH -DASH but we also get to see the whole thing .PERIOD 
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before ,COMMA and we see these genes turned on there .PERIOD 
So if you're in drug discovery ,COMMA for example ,COMMA you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize .PERIOD 
Most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying ,COMMA Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X .PERIOD 
And so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they're great .PERIOD They analyze large populations .PERIOD 
They look at their entire genomes ,COMMA and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes .PERIOD 
But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes .PERIOD 
It tells you the what ,COMMA but it doesn't tell you the where .PERIOD 
And so it's very important for those researchers that we've created this resource .PERIOD 
They can start to look at common pathways -DASH -DASH other things that they simply haven't been able to do before .PERIOD 
So I think this audience in particular can understand the importance of individuality .PERIOD 
And I think every human ,COMMA we all have different genetic backgrounds ,COMMA we all have lived separate lives .PERIOD 
But the fact is our genomes are greater than <NUM> percent similar .PERIOD 
We're similar at the genetic level .PERIOD 
And what we're finding is actually ,COMMA even at the brain biochemical level ,COMMA we are quite similar .PERIOD 
And so this shows it's not <NUM> percent ,COMMA but it's roughly <NUM> percent correspondence at a reasonable cutoff ,COMMA so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated .PERIOD 
So I think it's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences ,COMMA we are quite similar even at the brain level .PERIOD 
Now what do those differences look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is an example of a study that we did to follow up and see what exactly those differences were -DASH -DASH and they're quite subtle .PERIOD 
These are two genes that we found as good examples .PERIOD 
One is called RELN -DASH -DASH it's involved in early developmental cues .PERIOD 
DISC1 is a gene that's deleted in schizophrenia .PERIOD 
These aren't schizophrenic individuals ,COMMA but they do show some population variation .PERIOD 
And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four ,COMMA which are the exceptions to the other two ,COMMA that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells .PERIOD 
It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that's telling us a gene is turned on there .PERIOD 
Whether or not that's due to an individual's genetic background or their experiences ,COMMA we don't know .PERIOD 
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations .PERIOD 
So I'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go .PERIOD 
They give researchers a handle on where to go .PERIOD 
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .PERIOD 
We're certainly going to be looking at more .PERIOD 
I'll just close by saying that the tools are there ,COMMA and this is truly an unexplored ,COMMA undiscovered continent .PERIOD 
This is the new frontier ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
And so for those who are undaunted ,COMMA but humbled by the complexity of the brain ,COMMA the future awaits .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
So here it is .PERIOD You can check :COLON I am short ,COMMA I'm French ,COMMA I have a pretty strong French accent ,COMMA so that's going to be clear in a moment .PERIOD 
Maybe a sobering thought and something you all know about .PERIOD 
And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA every day ,COMMA <NUM> children die of entirely preventable causes .PERIOD 
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days .PERIOD 
And I suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well ,COMMA but somehow it doesn't happen with the same intensity .PERIOD 
So why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA here is a thought experiment for you .PERIOD 
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised -DASH -DASH maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend .PERIOD You want to spend it on the poor :COLON How do you go about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money ?QUESTIONMARK 
That we know how to eradicate poverty ,COMMA we just need to do more ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help ,COMMA on the contrary it might hurt ,COMMA it might exacerbate corruption ,COMMA dependence ,COMMA etc. ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or maybe you turn to the past .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA we have spent billions of dollars on aid .PERIOD 
Maybe you look at the past and see .PERIOD 
Has it done any good ?QUESTIONMARK 
And ,COMMA sadly ,COMMA we don't know .PERIOD 
These are the blue bars .PERIOD 
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA fine .PERIOD How do you know what would have happened without the aid ?QUESTIONMARK 
Maybe it would have been much worse ,COMMA or maybe it would have been better .PERIOD 
We have no idea .PERIOD We don't know what the counterfactual is .PERIOD 
There's only one Africa .PERIOD 
So what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
To give the aid ,COMMA and hope and pray that something comes out of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or do you focus on your everyday life and let the earthquake every eight days continue to happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
The thing is ,COMMA if we don't know whether we are doing any good ,COMMA we are not any better than the Medieval doctors and their leeches .PERIOD 
Sometimes the patient gets better ,COMMA sometimes the patient dies .PERIOD 
Is it the leeches ?QUESTIONMARK Is it something else ?QUESTIONMARK 
So here are some other questions .PERIOD 
They're smaller questions ,COMMA but they are not that small .PERIOD 
Immunization ,COMMA that's the cheapest way to save a child's life .PERIOD 
And the world has spent a lot of money on it :COLON The GAVI and the Gates Foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it ,COMMA and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA every year at least <NUM> million children do not get the immunization they should get .PERIOD 
So this is what you call a last mile problem .PERIOD 
The technology is there ,COMMA the infrastructure is there ,COMMA and yet it doesn't happen .PERIOD 
So you have your million .PERIOD 
How do you use your million to solve this last mile problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
And here's another question :COLON Malaria .PERIOD Malaria kills almost <NUM> people every year ,COMMA most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa ,COMMA most of them under five .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA that is the leading cause of under-five mortality .PERIOD 
We already know how to kill malaria ,COMMA but some people come to you and say ,COMMA You have your millions .PERIOD How about bed nets ?QUESTIONMARK 
Bed nets are very cheap .PERIOD 
For <NUM> dollars ,COMMA you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA not only do they protect the people who sleep under them ,COMMA but they have these great contagion benefits .PERIOD 
If half of a community sleeps under a net ,COMMA the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net .PERIOD 
Societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net ,COMMA give them for free ,COMMA or ,COMMA for that matter ,COMMA pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits .PERIOD 
Not so fast ,COMMA say other people .PERIOD 
If you give the nets for free ,COMMA people are not going to value them .PERIOD 
They're not going to use them ,COMMA or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets ,COMMA maybe as fishing nets .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage ,COMMA or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
Maybe that's the solution ,COMMA maybe we should send kids to school .PERIOD 
But how do you do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you hire teachers ?QUESTIONMARK Do you build more schools ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you provide school lunch ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
So here is the thing .PERIOD 
I cannot answer the big question ,COMMA whether aid did any good or not .PERIOD 
But these three questions ,COMMA I can answer them .PERIOD 
It's not the Middle Ages anymore ,COMMA it's the 21st century .PERIOD 
And in the 20th century ,COMMA randomized ,COMMA controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don't work .PERIOD 
And you can do the same randomized ,COMMA controlled trial for social policy .PERIOD 
You can put social innovation to the same rigorous ,COMMA scientific tests that we use for drugs .PERIOD 
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions .PERIOD 
So I start with immunization .PERIOD 
Here's Udaipur District ,COMMA Rajasthan .PERIOD Beautiful .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA when I started working there ,COMMA about one percent of children were fully immunized .PERIOD 
That's bad ,COMMA but there are places like that .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it's not because the vaccines are not there -DASH -DASH they are there and they are free -DASH -DASH and it's not because parents do not care about their kids .PERIOD 
The same child that is not immunized against measles ,COMMA if they do get measles ,COMMA parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them .PERIOD 
So you get these empty village subcenters and crowded hospitals .PERIOD 
So what is the problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA part of the problem ,COMMA surely ,COMMA is people do not fully understand .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA in this country as well ,COMMA all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization .PERIOD 
So if that's the case ,COMMA that's difficult ,COMMA because persuasion is really difficult .PERIOD 
But maybe there is another problem as well .PERIOD 
Imagine you are a mother in Udaipur District ,COMMA Rajasthan .PERIOD 
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized .PERIOD 
And maybe when you get there ,COMMA what you find is this :COLON The subcenter is closed .PERIOD Ao you have to come back ,COMMA and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do ,COMMA you will always tend to postpone and postpone ,COMMA and eventually it gets too late .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if that's the problem ,COMMA then that's much easier .PERIOD 
Because A ,COMMA we can make it easy ,COMMA and B ,COMMA we can maybe give people a reason to act today ,COMMA rather than wait till tomorrow .PERIOD 
So these are simple ideas ,COMMA but we didn't know .PERIOD 
So let's try them .PERIOD 
So what we did is we did a randomized ,COMMA controlled trial in <NUM> villages in Udaipur Districts .PERIOD 
So the blue dots are selected randomly .PERIOD 
We made it easy -DASH -DASH I'll tell you how in a moment .PERIOD 
In the red dots ,COMMA we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now .PERIOD 
The white dots are comparisons ,COMMA nothing changed .PERIOD 
So we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized .PERIOD 
And then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA a kilo of lentils is tiny .PERIOD 
It's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don't want to do .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA if your problem is you tend to postpone ,COMMA then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later .PERIOD 
So what do we find ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA beforehand ,COMMA everything is the same .PERIOD 
That's the beauty of randomization .PERIOD 
Afterwards ,COMMA the camp -DASH -DASH just having the camp -DASH -DASH increases immunization from six percent to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
That's full immunization .PERIOD 
That's not bad ,COMMA that's a good improvement .PERIOD 
Add the lentils and you reach to <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
So here you've got your answer .PERIOD 
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils ,COMMA you multiply immunization rate by six .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you might say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA but it's not sustainable .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it turns out it's wrong economics ,COMMA because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them .PERIOD 
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway ,COMMA the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't .PERIOD 
How about bed nets ?QUESTIONMARK 
Should you give them for free ,COMMA or should you ask people to pay for them ?QUESTIONMARK 
So the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions .PERIOD 
One is :COLON If people must pay for a bed net ,COMMA are they going to purchase them ?QUESTIONMARK 
The second one is :COLON If I give bed nets for free ,COMMA are people going to use them ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the third one is :COLON Do free bed nets discourage future purchase ?QUESTIONMARK 
The third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts ,COMMA it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .PERIOD 
Now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .PERIOD 
It's more ideological than practical ,COMMA but it turns out it's an easy question .PERIOD 
We can know the answer to this question .PERIOD 
And many experiments have been run ,COMMA and they all have the same results ,COMMA so I'm just going to talk to you about one .PERIOD 
And this one that was in Kenya ,COMMA they went around and distributed to people vouchers ,COMMA discount vouchers .PERIOD 
So people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy .PERIOD 
And some people get <NUM> percent discount ,COMMA and some people get <NUM> percent discounts ,COMMA and some people get <NUM> percent discount ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And now we can see what happens .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how about the purchasing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets ,COMMA the coverage rate really falls down a lot .PERIOD 
So even with partial subsidy ,COMMA three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net ,COMMA and now you only have <NUM> percent of the people with the bed nets ,COMMA you lose the health immunity ,COMMA that's not great .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the good news is ,COMMA people ,COMMA if they have the bed nets ,COMMA will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it .PERIOD 
If they get it for free ,COMMA they use it .PERIOD 
If they have to pay for it ,COMMA they use it .PERIOD 
How about the long term ?QUESTIONMARK 
In the long term ,COMMA people who got the free bed nets ,COMMA one year later ,COMMA were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars .PERIOD 
And people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn't get a free one .PERIOD 
So people do not get used to handouts ;SEMICOLON they get used to nets .PERIOD 
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's for bed nets .PERIOD So you will think ,COMMA That's great .PERIOD 
You know how to immunize kids ,COMMA you know how to give bed nets .PERIOD 
But what politicians need is a range of options .PERIOD 
They need to know :COLON Out of all the things I could do ,COMMA what is the best way to achieve my goals ?QUESTIONMARK 
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school .PERIOD 
There are so many things you could do .PERIOD You could pay for uniforms ,COMMA you could eliminate fees ,COMMA you could build latrines ,COMMA you could give girls sanitary pads ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
So what's the best ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA at some level ,COMMA we think all of these things should work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA is that sufficient ?QUESTIONMARK If we think they should work intuitively ,COMMA should we go for them ?QUESTIONMARK 
Consider for example transporting goods .PERIOD 
Before the canals were invented in Britain before the Industrial Revolution ,COMMA goods used to go on horse carts .PERIOD 
And then canals were built ,COMMA and with the same horseman and the same horse ,COMMA you could carry ten times as much cargo .PERIOD 
So should they have continued to carry the goods on the horse carts ,COMMA on the ground ,COMMA that they would eventually get there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA if that had been the case ,COMMA there would have been no Industrial Revolution .PERIOD 
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy ?QUESTIONMARK 
In technology ,COMMA we spend so much time experimenting ,COMMA fine-tuning ,COMMA getting the absolute cheapest way to do something ,COMMA so why aren't we doing that with social policy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA with experiments ,COMMA what you can do is answer a simple question .PERIOD 
Suppose you have <NUM> dollars to spend on various interventions .PERIOD 
How many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects ,COMMA hire teachers ,COMMA school meals ,COMMA school uniforms ,COMMA scholarships .PERIOD 
And that's not bad .PERIOD For your hundred dollars ,COMMA you get between one and three extra years of education .PERIOD 
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents ,COMMA just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money .PERIOD 
And here are the most surprising results .PERIOD 
Tell people the benefits of education ,COMMA that's very cheap to do .PERIOD 
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that ,COMMA you get <NUM> extra years of education .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA in places where there are worms ,COMMA intestinal worms ,COMMA cure the kids of their worms .PERIOD 
And for every hundred dollars ,COMMA you get almost <NUM> extra years of education .PERIOD 
So this is not your intuition ,COMMA this is not what people would have gone for ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA these are the programs that work .PERIOD 
We need that kind of information ,COMMA we need more of it ,COMMA and then we need to guide policy .PERIOD 
And I cut it into smaller questions ,COMMA and I have the answer to these smaller questions .PERIOD 
And they are good ,COMMA scientific ,COMMA robust answers .PERIOD 
So let's go back to Haiti for a moment .PERIOD 
And the response of the world was great :COLON Two billion dollars got pledged just last month ,COMMA so that's about <NUM> dollars per death .PERIOD 
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it .PERIOD 
But if we were willing to spend <NUM> dollars for every child under five who dies ,COMMA that would be <NUM> billion per year just for that problem .PERIOD 
And yet it doesn't happen .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I think what part of the problem is that ,COMMA in Haiti ,COMMA although the problem is huge ,COMMA somehow we understand it ,COMMA it's localized .PERIOD 
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders ,COMMA you give your money to Partners In Health ,COMMA and they'll send in the doctors ,COMMA and they'll send in the lumber ,COMMA and they'll helicopter things out and in .PERIOD 
And the problem of poverty is not like that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA first ,COMMA it's mostly invisible ;SEMICOLON second ,COMMA it's huge ;SEMICOLON and third ,COMMA we don't know whether we are doing the right thing .PERIOD 
There's no silver bullet .PERIOD 
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty .PERIOD 
And that's very frustrating .PERIOD 
But look what we just did today .PERIOD 
I gave you three simple answers to three questions :COLON Give lentils to immunize people ,COMMA provide free bed nets ,COMMA deworm children .PERIOD 
With immunization or bed nets ,COMMA you can save a life for <NUM> dollars per life saved .PERIOD 
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet ,COMMA but we can get started .PERIOD 
And maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective .PERIOD 
Here's an example of how this can be powerful .PERIOD 
Deworming .PERIOD 
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines .PERIOD 
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA when the young global leader in Davos showed the numbers I gave you ,COMMA they started Deworm the World .PERIOD 
And thanks to Deworm the World ,COMMA and the effort of many country governments and foundations ,COMMA <NUM> million school-aged children got dewormed in <NUM> .PERIOD 
So we should get started now .PERIOD 
It's not going to be easy .PERIOD 
It's a very slow process .PERIOD 
You have to keep experimenting ,COMMA and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality .PERIOD 
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere .PERIOD 
So it's a slow process ,COMMA but there is no other way .PERIOD 
It's a slow ,COMMA deliberative process of discovery .PERIOD 
There is no miracle cure ,COMMA but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year ,COMMA and we can do the same thing .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA we can go back to the bigger question that I started with at the beginning .PERIOD 
I cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference ,COMMA but can we come back here in <NUM> years and say ,COMMA What we have done ,COMMA it really prompted a change for the better .PERIOD 
I believe we can and I hope we will .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Welcome to Africa !EXCLAMATIONMARK Or rather ,COMMA I should say ,COMMA welcome home .PERIOD 
Because this is where it all really began ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -DASH -DASH it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here .PERIOD 
We are on an amazing journey the next four days .PERIOD 
You're going to hear stories of Africa :COLON The Next Chapter .PERIOD 
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment ,COMMA and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say .PERIOD 
What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa ?QUESTIONMARK 
And this is not a rhetorical question .PERIOD 
I actually want answers from you .PERIOD 
Go for it !EXCLAMATIONMARK The worst .PERIOD 
Famine .PERIOD 
Corruption .PERIOD 
More .PERIOD 
Genocide .PERIOD 
AIDS .PERIOD 
Slavery .PERIOD 
That's enough .PERIOD 
We've all heard these things .PERIOD 
But this is about Africa ,COMMA the story we have not heard .PERIOD 
The stories that we want to know ,COMMA and the stories that do exist about positive tales .PERIOD 
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent ,COMMA to separate the rhetoric from the reality ,COMMA the fact from the fiction .PERIOD 
To go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you .PERIOD 
So let's get going because Africa ,COMMA to some degree ,COMMA is on a turnaround .PERIOD 
A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image ,COMMA and how it takes control of its own destiny .PERIOD 
And it all started almost a decade ago ,COMMA as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp ;SEMICOLON Company at their first African office in Johannesburg .PERIOD 
And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues ,COMMA and African companies on turnarounds ,COMMA making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally .PERIOD 
But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States .PERIOD 
It all began with a fantastic phone call .PERIOD 
It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter ,COMMA Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine .PERIOD 
And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela .PERIOD 
Because Nelson Mandela ,COMMA as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa ,COMMA faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos .PERIOD 
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle .PERIOD 
Now the case ,COMMA Nelson Mandela :COLON Change Leader ,COMMA became part of the research base for a chapter in Rosabeth's new book called Confidence .PERIOD 
And Confidence became a New York Times bestseller and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list .PERIOD 
And why I tell you this story is because later ,COMMA when I was interviewed on SABC Africa ,COMMA on a pan-African broadcast ,COMMA they asked ,COMMA What is your key lesson ,COMMA or the key thing you enjoy the most ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project .PERIOD 
The lesson from that was that it was Africa -DASH -DASH an African story -DASH -DASH that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds .PERIOD 
Africa was being used as a success story !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So I want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation .PERIOD 
And that has to do with me because in <NUM> ,COMMA I packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .PERIOD 
You should have seen my parents' reaction !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
But very soon ,COMMA I found myself from the southern part of Africa ,COMMA in South Africa -DASH -DASH at the very north ,COMMA in Egypt .PERIOD 
And I sought out the most remote places .PERIOD 
I went to the Siwa Oasis .PERIOD That was one of my stops .PERIOD 
And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things ,COMMA but the key thing is that it was the place that Alexander the Great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him .PERIOD 
And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert .PERIOD 
Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm .PERIOD 
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle ,COMMA and it foretold his destiny of greatness .PERIOD 
This was <NUM> BC .PERIOD 
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the thing I remember about Siwa was the magical view of the sky at night .PERIOD 
With no natural light source ,COMMA Siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry .PERIOD 
Fast forward to <NUM> .PERIOD 
I'm sitting in Cambridge ,COMMA Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference .PERIOD 
And I see the same picture ,COMMA but from the opposite side .PERIOD 
A satellite picture looking down at the earth .PERIOD 
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it .PERIOD I remember the very moment .PERIOD 
And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point .PERIOD 
And then I saw it -DASH -DASH Africa .PERIOD Quite literally the Dark Continent .PERIOD 
And while Africa may be dark ,COMMA the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing ,COMMA but it's also the opportunity .PERIOD 
Because whilst Africa may be dark -DASH -DASH other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -DASH -DASH it's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there .PERIOD 
It was George Kimble ,COMMA the geographer ,COMMA who said that ,COMMA The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it .PERIOD 
Let's start unpacking it .PERIOD 
Africa is the second-largest continent ,COMMA a landmass second from Asia .PERIOD 
It also is the second most populated continent ,COMMA with <NUM> million people .PERIOD 
In fact -DASH -DASH coming back to the land mass -DASH -DASH Africa is so big that you could fit in the continental United States ,COMMA China ,COMMA and the entire Europe into Africa ,COMMA and still have space .PERIOD 
Africa is home to over <NUM> languages -DASH -DASH <NUM> is another estimate that's out there -DASH -DASH with over <NUM> languages and dialects .PERIOD 
But you could say ,COMMA Invest in Africa in over <NUM> languages ,COMMA and it wouldn't make a difference .PERIOD 
What does the data say ?QUESTIONMARK 
As an investment banker ,COMMA I'm in the cross-flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets .PERIOD 
So let's start on that .PERIOD 
Inflation ,COMMA in general ,COMMA is coming down across Africa -DASH -DASH that's the first sign -DASH -DASH in many countries reaching double-digit figures .PERIOD 
So let's start looking at some of those .PERIOD 
I call it my Z.E.N .PERIOD cluster .PERIOD 
Zambia :COLON from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA moves from the <NUM> percent in inflation to the nine percent .PERIOD 
Nigeria :COLON a similar situation ,COMMA from the <NUM> percent to the eight percent .PERIOD Single digits .PERIOD 
More fascinating ,COMMA you have other countries -DASH -DASH South Africa ,COMMA Mauritius ,COMMA Namibia -DASH -DASH all in single digits .PERIOD 
But that's just part of the story .PERIOD You have a similar trend with currencies -DASH -DASH currencies going through an extreme time of stability .PERIOD 
But that's looking at the big picture .PERIOD 
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country .PERIOD 
It's made up -DASH -DASH It's made up of <NUM> different countries .PERIOD 
So the very definition -DASH -DASH to say invest in Africa is a no-go .PERIOD 
It's meaningless .PERIOD 
Each country has a unique value proposition .PERIOD 
You can make money ,COMMA you can lose money in Africa .PERIOD 
But opportunities ,COMMA boy oh boy ,COMMA they exist .PERIOD 
And this is what today is about -DASH -DASH it's about discussing those very opportunities .PERIOD 
So let's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data .PERIOD 
I was recently elected ,COMMA as Emeka mentioned ,COMMA as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America .PERIOD 
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in .PERIOD 
To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity ,COMMA of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come .PERIOD 
So the first port of call :COLON let's talk a little bit about South Africa .PERIOD 
But not the South Africa we always talk about -DASH -DASH the gold ,COMMA the minerals ,COMMA the First World infrastructure -DASH -DASH a bit about the other side of it .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA South Africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top <NUM> UK companies for offshore call-centers .PERIOD 
Same language ,COMMA timeline ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD Makes sense .PERIOD 
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa were Bain Capital and KKR ,COMMA the big boys of private equity .PERIOD 
Headline in South Africa :COLON They have landed .PERIOD Quite ominous .PERIOD 
Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon ,COMMA a large retailer ,COMMA is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy .PERIOD 
Because it is actually a long-term play .PERIOD 
Being a retailer ,COMMA it is a play on the belief that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow ,COMMA that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue .PERIOD 
But the story of Africa ,COMMA and my focus ,COMMA is beyond South Africa because there's so much happening .PERIOD 
Undoubtedly ,COMMA Nigeria is clearly a hot spot .PERIOD 
Challenges -DASH -DASH and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days .PERIOD 
But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -DASH -DASH we had the famous BRIC Report .PERIOD 
The new report ,COMMA The Next Eleven ,COMMA highlights that by <NUM> Nigeria is going to be amongst the top <NUM> economies in the world .PERIOD 
It's an investment opportunity .PERIOD Think about that .PERIOD 
Is anyone -DASH -DASH our banks ,COMMA our investors -DASH -DASH seriously thinking about going to Nigeria ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you haven't ,COMMA why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's going on in Nigeria ?QUESTIONMARK A couple of things .PERIOD 
I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .PERIOD 
Bellwether signs again .PERIOD 
But the first Eurobond ,COMMA the raising of international capital offshore ,COMMA off its own balance sheet ,COMMA without any sovereign backing -DASH -DASH that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy .PERIOD 
Without any sovereign backing ,COMMA a Nigerian company raising capital offshore .PERIOD 
It's just a sign of things to come .PERIOD 
Looking at the oil industry ,COMMA Africa provides <NUM> percent of the U.S.'s oil supply ,COMMA with the Middle East just <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
It's an important strategic partner .PERIOD 
Let's put Nigeria in perspective .PERIOD 
But with Africa ,COMMA let's start being careful about this .PERIOD 
And Emeka and I have had these discussions .PERIOD 
We have to move away from what's called the curse of the commodities .PERIOD 
Because it's not about oil ,COMMA it's not about commodities .PERIOD 
For Africa to truly be sustainable ,COMMA we have to move beyond to other industries .PERIOD 
Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone -DASH -DASH <NUM> billion investment .PERIOD 
The announcement just came out the last few weeks .PERIOD 
It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company .PERIOD 
So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries -DASH -DASH away from oil .PERIOD 
Let's look at agriculture .PERIOD Let's look at forestry .PERIOD 
What's going on there ?QUESTIONMARK 
In Tanzania last week ,COMMA we had the launch of the East African Organic Produce Standard .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA gathering together farmers ,COMMA gathering together stakeholders in East Africa to get standards for organic produce .PERIOD Better prices .PERIOD 
It ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides ,COMMA no fertilizers .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .PERIOD 
Uganda :COLON the New Forest Company ,COMMA replanting and redeveloping their forests .PERIOD Why is that important ?QUESTIONMARK 
As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need] poles for rolling out electricity .PERIOD 
But here is the sweetener in the deal .PERIOD 
They're going to be tapping into carbon credits .PERIOD 
Let's go back to Nigeria .PERIOD 
The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation ,COMMA from over <NUM> banks to <NUM> banks .PERIOD Strengthening of the system .PERIOD 
But what's going on there ?QUESTIONMARK Only <NUM> percent of the country is banked .PERIOD 
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria .PERIOD 
<NUM> million-plus people .PERIOD Think about that .PERIOD 
There are only <NUM> ATMs in the country .PERIOD Opportunity .PERIOD 
The same for telecoms across the country .PERIOD 
Now let's look at the continent as a whole .PERIOD 
People look at the roads ,COMMA for example ,COMMA and they'd say ,COMMA Angola :COLON <NUM> percent of roads are untarred .PERIOD Ah ,COMMA problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
It's more expensive to transport goods .PERIOD Prices of goods go up ,COMMA inflation is affected .PERIOD 
Nigeria :COLON <NUM> percent of roads are untarred .PERIOD Zambia :COLON <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
In general ,COMMA more than <NUM> percent of roads are untarred .PERIOD 
This is an opportunity !EXCLAMATIONMARK Energy needs -DASH -DASH it's an opportunity .PERIOD 
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa .PERIOD 
If I had to ask you ,COMMA In <NUM> what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ?QUESTIONMARK Would Egypt come to mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
In <NUM> ,COMMA the Egyptian stock exchange returned over <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Let's look at some <NUM> numbers .PERIOD Kenya :COLON over <NUM> percent .PERIOD Nigeria :COLON over <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
South Africa :COLON in the <NUM> percents .PERIOD High ones .PERIOD 
These are the trends that are taking place .PERIOD 
Because in Africa today ,COMMA we are competing globally for capital .PERIOD 
And global capital is agnostic -DASH -DASH it has no loyalties .PERIOD 
There's an overhang of capital in the U.S. ,COMMA and the key is yield pickup .PERIOD 
What Africa is providing is a diversification play ,COMMA and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that's aware of what he or she is doing .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago there ,COMMA were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the Standard &amp ;SEMICOLON Poors ,COMMA Moody's and Fitch's .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA <NUM> African countries and growing have sovereign country ratings .PERIOD What does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
Take Nigeria again :COLON double B-minus -DASH -DASH in the league of Ukraine and Turkey .PERIOD Immediately we have a comparison .PERIOD 
The backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital .PERIOD 
Some other figures .PERIOD South Africa :COLON triple B-plus .PERIOD Botswana :COLON A-plus .PERIOD 
Bakino Faso :COLON B-minus .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa .PERIOD 
Why are they doing that ?QUESTIONMARK Because they expect investment to follow .PERIOD 
So one of the big bellwethers ,COMMA and one of my final points I want to mention ,COMMA is the interesting thing I read is that CNBC has launched their first African channel .PERIOD Why is CNBC doing this ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel .PERIOD 
They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen .PERIOD 
Me and you ,COMMA the investments we are going to be making ,COMMA the investments the world is going to be making -DASH -DASH that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa .PERIOD 
So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline .PERIOD 
So in conclusion ,COMMA I want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago .PERIOD 
This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in <NUM> ,COMMA and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa ,COMMA think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent .PERIOD 
Because there are amazing opportunities available .PERIOD 
And think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly .PERIOD 
If one looks carefully ,COMMA on the Congo River is one of those bright lights .PERIOD And that's the very Congo river generating light -DASH -DASH the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power .PERIOD 
That is a transformation in power of ideas .PERIOD 
So the next step ,COMMA over the next four days ,COMMA is us exploring more of these ideas .PERIOD 
And perchance ,COMMA if you can always keep this picture in your mind ,COMMA that when we convene maybe in the distant future ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA that picture will look very different .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Brain magic .PERIOD What's brain magic all about ?QUESTIONMARK 
So unlike traditional magic ,COMMA it uses the power of words ,COMMA linguistic deception ,COMMA non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how .PERIOD 
And I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody here .PERIOD 
I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me ,COMMA first of all .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA clap them together ,COMMA once .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA reverse your hands .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA follow my actions exactly .PERIOD 
Now about half the audience has their left hand up .PERIOD Why is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA swap them around ,COMMA put your right hand up .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA cross your hands over ,COMMA so your right hand goes over ,COMMA interlace your fingers like this ,COMMA then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb -DASH -DASH that's very important .PERIOD 
Yours is the other way around ,COMMA so swap it around .PERIOD 
Excellent ,COMMA OK .PERIOD Extend your fingers like this for me .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD Tap them together once .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA if you did not allow me to deceive your minds ,COMMA you would all be able to do this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I remember when I was about <NUM> ,COMMA I read a copy of Life magazine ,COMMA which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters -DASH -DASH there's still people trying to do it here -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH who could sense printed letters and even sense colors ,COMMA just by touch .PERIOD 
And she was completely blind .PERIOD 
She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed ,COMMA face down ,COMMA on a hard surface .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I was fascinated ,COMMA but at the same time ,COMMA skeptical .PERIOD 
How could somebody read using their fingertips ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA if you actually think about it ,COMMA if somebody is totally blind -DASH -DASH a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms ,COMMA where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things .PERIOD 
And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out .PERIOD 
How could somebody read using their fingertips ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now earlier on ,COMMA as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV ,COMMA I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's take a look .PERIOD 
Man :COLON There we go .PERIOD 
I'm going to guide you into the car .PERIOD 
Kathryn Thomas :COLON Man :COLON You're OK ,COMMA keep on going .PERIOD 
How are you ?QUESTIONMARK 
Keith Barry :COLON Kathryn ,COMMA it's Keith here .PERIOD I'm going to take you to a secret location ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA Kathryn ,COMMA there was no way you could see through that blindfold ,COMMA at all ,COMMA through all that .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA but don't say my name like that .PERIOD 
Yes .PERIOD 
There's no way you could have seen through it ,COMMA agreed ?QUESTIONMARK 
No .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA I'm just going to take it off .PERIOD You're OK ,COMMA you're OK .PERIOD 
Do you want to take off the other part of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Go ahead and take it off ,COMMA you're OK .PERIOD We'll just stop for a second .PERIOD 
I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA you're fine ,COMMA you're fine ,COMMA take it off .PERIOD You're OK .PERIOD You're safe .PERIOD 
Have you ever heard of second sight ?QUESTIONMARK 
No .PERIOD 
Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes .PERIOD 
And I'm going to try that right now .PERIOD 
God .PERIOD 
Are you ready ?QUESTIONMARK 
Where is it ?QUESTIONMARK There's no way .. .PERIOD 
 Oh ,COMMA my God !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Don't say anything ,COMMA I'm trying to see through your eyes .PERIOD I can't see .PERIOD 
There's a wall ,COMMA there's a wall .PERIOD 
Look at the road ,COMMA look at the road .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA OK ,COMMA OK .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my God !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA anything coming at all ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
Sure there's not ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA no ,COMMA I'm just still looking at the road .PERIOD 
I'm looking at the road ,COMMA all the time .PERIOD 
I'm not taking my eyes off the road .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA my God !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Where are we ?QUESTIONMARK Where are we ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're going uphill ,COMMA are we going uphill ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look at the road -DASH -DASH Still got that goddamn blindfold on .PERIOD 
What ?QUESTIONMARK 
How are you doing this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Just don't break my concentration .PERIOD 
We're OK ,COMMA though ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes .PERIOD 
That's so weird .PERIOD 
We're nearly there .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA my God !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Oh ,COMMA my God !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And I've stopped .PERIOD 
You're like a freak-ass of nature .PERIOD 
That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
By the way ,COMMA two days ago ,COMMA we were going to film this down there ,COMMA at the race course ,COMMA and we got a guy into a car ,COMMA and we got a camera man in the back ,COMMA but halfway through the drive ,COMMA he told me he had a -DASH -DASH I think it was a nine-millimeter or something ,COMMA stuck to his leg .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I stopped pretty quick ,COMMA and that was it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's the question .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA most people here would automatically say no .PERIOD OK ,COMMA but I want you to realize some facts .PERIOD 
I couldn't see through the blindfold .PERIOD 
The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way .PERIOD 
The girl ,COMMA I'd never met before ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I want you to just think about it for a moment .PERIOD 
A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception ,COMMA the solutions you come up with will ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the time ,COMMA be way off the mark .PERIOD 
This is because magic is all about directing attention .PERIOD 
If ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA I didn't want you to look at my right hand ,COMMA well ,COMMA then ,COMMA I don't look at it .PERIOD 
But if I wanted you to look at my right hand ,COMMA then I look at it ,COMMA too .PERIOD You see ,COMMA it's very ,COMMA very simple ,COMMA once you know how ,COMMA but very complicated in other ways .PERIOD 
I need two people to help me out real quick .PERIOD 
Can you come up ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes ,COMMA at the end .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA give them a round of applause as they come up .PERIOD 
You might want to use the stairs ,COMMA there .PERIOD 
Nicole :COLON Nicole .PERIOD 
Nicole ,COMMA and ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA oh .PERIOD Tell them -DASH -DASH actually here's the thing ,COMMA answer it ,COMMA answer it ,COMMA answer it .PERIOD 
Is it a girl ?QUESTIONMARK 
Man :COLON They've already gone .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA they're gone ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
I'll tell you what ,COMMA swap over positions .PERIOD 
Can you stand over here ?QUESTIONMARK This will just make it a little bit easier .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA that was a pity .PERIOD I would have told them it was the ace of spades .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA a little bit closer .PERIOD 
A little bit closer .PERIOD 
Come in a little bit closer .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA do you believe in witchcraft at all ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON No .PERIOD 
Nicole :COLON No .PERIOD 
Things that go bump in the night ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON No .PERIOD 
I want you to just stand exactly like this for me ,COMMA pull up your sleeves ,COMMA if you don't mind .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you ,COMMA because we're going to try a voodoo experiment right now .PERIOD 
From this point onwards ,COMMA close your eyes ,COMMA do not say anything ,COMMA do not open them ,COMMA be aware of the sensations .PERIOD 
Nicole :COLON Yes .PERIOD 
You did feel that ?QUESTIONMARK What did you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON A touch on my back .PERIOD 
How many times did you feel it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON Twice .PERIOD 
Twice .PERIOD OK ,COMMA extend your left arm out in front of you .PERIOD 
Extend your left arm ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA keep it there .PERIOD 
Be aware of the sensations ,COMMA don't say anything ,COMMA don't open your eyes ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Did you feel anything ,COMMA there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON Yes .PERIOD 
What did you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON Three -DASH -DASH KB :COLON Like a tickling sensation ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON Yes .PERIOD 
Can you show us where ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA excellent .PERIOD Open your eyes .PERIOD 
I never touched you .PERIOD 
I just touched his back ,COMMA and I just touched his arm .PERIOD 
A voodoo experiment .PERIOD 
You just take a seat over here for a second .PERIOD 
I'm going to use you again ,COMMA in a moment .PERIOD 
Sit right here .PERIOD 
Man :COLON OK .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA take a seat .PERIOD Excellent ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what I want you to do is look directly at me ,COMMA OK ,COMMA just take a deep breath in through your nose ,COMMA letting it out through your mouth ,COMMA and relax .PERIOD 
Allow your eyes to close ,COMMA on five ,COMMA four ,COMMA three ,COMMA two ,COMMA one .PERIOD 
Close your eyes right now .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA I'm not hypnotizing you ,COMMA I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity ,COMMA so our minds are along the same lines .PERIOD 
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind ,COMMA I'm going to take your left hand ,COMMA and just place it up here .PERIOD 
That's it ,COMMA all the way down ,COMMA all the way down ,COMMA all the way down ,COMMA and further ,COMMA and further ,COMMA and further ,COMMA and further ,COMMA and further and further .PERIOD 
Excellent .PERIOD 
I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA allow it to stay there .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA in a moment ,COMMA you'll feel a certain pressure ,COMMA OK ,COMMA and I want you to be aware of the pressure .PERIOD 
Just be aware of the pressure .PERIOD 
And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release ,COMMA but only when you feel the pressure release .PERIOD 
Do you understand ?QUESTIONMARK Just answer yes or no .PERIOD 
Do you understand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Man :COLON Yes .PERIOD 
Hold it right there .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA that was wonderfully done .PERIOD Let's try it again .PERIOD 
Excellent .PERIOD Now that you've got the idea ,COMMA let's try something even more interesting .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA just stand ,COMMA stage forward .PERIOD 
I want you to point directly at his forehead ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Only when you want the pressure to be released ,COMMA make an upward gesture ,COMMA like this ,COMMA but only when you want the pressure to be released .PERIOD 
You can wait as long as you want ,COMMA but only when you want the pressure released .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA let's try it again .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA now ,COMMA imagine the connection ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Only when you want the pressure released ,COMMA we'll try it again .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA it worked that time ,COMMA excellent .PERIOD 
And hold it there ,COMMA hold it there ,COMMA both of you ,COMMA hold it there .PERIOD 
Only when you want the pressure to go back ,COMMA make a downward gesture .PERIOD 
You can wait as long as you want .PERIOD 
You did it pretty quickly ,COMMA but it went down ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
It's OK to remember to forget ,COMMA or forget to remember what happened .PERIOD 
Most people ask you ,COMMA What the hell just happened up here ?QUESTIONMARK 
But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized ,COMMA you will forget everything that happened .PERIOD 
On five ,COMMA four ,COMMA three ,COMMA two ,COMMA one -DASH -DASH open your eyes ,COMMA wide awake .PERIOD 
Give them a round of applause ,COMMA as they go back to their seats .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA you can go back .PERIOD 
I once saw a film called The Gods Are Crazy .PERIOD 
Has anybody here seen that film ?QUESTIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD 
Do you remember when they threw the Coke bottle out of the airplane ,COMMA and it landed on the ground ,COMMA and it didn't break ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA see ,COMMA that's because Coke bottles are solid .PERIOD 
Do you want to try it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Good job .PERIOD 
She's not taking any chances .PERIOD 
For some magicians or mentalists ,COMMA sometimes the spoon will bend or melt ,COMMA sometimes it will not .PERIOD 
Sometimes the object will slide across the table ,COMMA sometimes it will not .PERIOD 
It depends on how much energy you have that day ,COMMA so on and so forth .PERIOD 
We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis ,COMMA right now .PERIOD 
Come right over here ,COMMA next to me .PERIOD 
Excellent .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA have a look at the Coke bottle .PERIOD 
Make sure it is solid ,COMMA there's only one hole ,COMMA and it's a normal Coke bottle .PERIOD 
And you can whack it against the table ,COMMA if you want .PERIOD 
Be careful .PERIOD 
Even though it's solid ,COMMA I'm standing away .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb .PERIOD 
Excellent .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I've got a shard of glass here ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
I want you to examine the shard of glass .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA hold it out here .PERIOD 
I want you to imagine ,COMMA right now ,COMMA a broken relationship from many years ago .PERIOD 
I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship ,COMMA from that guy ,COMMA being imparted into the broken piece of glass ,COMMA which will represent him ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
But I want you to take this very seriously .PERIOD 
Stare at the glass ,COMMA ignore everybody right here .PERIOD 
In a moment ,COMMA you'll feel a certain sensation ,COMMA OK ,COMMA and when you feel that sensation ,COMMA I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle .PERIOD 
Think of that guy ,COMMA that ba -DASH -DASH that guy .PERIOD 
I'm trying to be good here .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA and when you feel the sensation -DASH -DASH it might take a while -DASH -DASH drop it into the glass .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA drop it in .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA imagine all that negative energy in there .PERIOD 
Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass .PERIOD 
That was a lot of negative energy ,COMMA built up in there .PERIOD 
I also want you to think of his name .PERIOD Look at me and think of his name .PERIOD 
Have you got his name ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA think of how many letters in the title of his name .PERIOD 
Think about how many letters in the title .PERIOD 
You didn't react to that ,COMMA so it's four letters in the title .PERIOD 
Think of one of the letters in the title .PERIOD 
Think of one of the letters .PERIOD 
See the way I knew that ,COMMA because my name starts with a K also ,COMMA but his name doesn't start with a K ,COMMA it starts with an M .PERIOD 
Tell Mike I said hello ,COMMA the next time you see him .PERIOD 
Was that his name ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nicole :COLON Mm-hmm .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA give her a round of applause .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I've got one more thing to share with you right now .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA Chris ,COMMA I was going to pick you for this ,COMMA but instead of picking you ,COMMA can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it should be a male victim ,COMMA that's the only thing .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Oh ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
I was going to use you for this ,COMMA but I decided I might want to come back another year .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA to reward him for saying eureka ,COMMA and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us -DASH -DASH Steve Jurvetson .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA come on up here .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA I want you to take a seat ,COMMA right behind here .PERIOD Excellent .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Steve -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA you can check underneath .PERIOD 
Go ahead ,COMMA I've no fancy assistants underneath there .PERIOD 
They just ,COMMA they insist that because I was a magician ,COMMA put a nice ,COMMA black tablecloth on .PERIOD 
There you are ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
I've got four wooden plinths here ,COMMA Steve .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three and four .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it .PERIOD 
I want you to examine it ,COMMA and make sure it's solid .PERIOD 
Happy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Steve Jurvetson :COLON Mmm ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD Now ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA I'm going to stand in front of the table ,COMMA OK .PERIOD When I stand in front of the table ,COMMA I want you to put the cups on the plinths ,COMMA like this ,COMMA in any order you want ,COMMA and then mix them all up ,COMMA so nobody has any idea where the spike is ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
No one in the audience ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'll also look away .PERIOD So ,COMMA go ahead and mix them up ,COMMA now .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA and tell me when you're done .PERIOD 
You done ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mmm ,COMMA almost .PERIOD 
Almost ,COMMA oh .PERIOD OK ,COMMA you're making sure that's well hidden .PERIOD Now -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA we've got one here ,COMMA we've got one here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all right ,COMMA we'll leave them like that .PERIOD 
I'm going to have the last laugh ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA you know where the spike is ,COMMA but nobody else ,COMMA does ?QUESTIONMARK Correct ?QUESTIONMARK 
They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA stay around ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA look back .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now you don't know where the spike is ,COMMA and I don't know where it is either ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA is there any way to see through this blindfold ?QUESTIONMARK 
Put this on ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA just ,COMMA is there any way to see through it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Um ,COMMA um .PERIOD 
No ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA I can't see through it .PERIOD 
You can't see through it .PERIOD Excellent ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm going to put on the blindfold .PERIOD 
Don't stack them up ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
Give them an extra mix up .PERIOD 
Don't move the cups ,COMMA because I don't want anybody to see where the spike is ,COMMA but give the plinths an extra mix up ,COMMA and then line them up ,COMMA like this ,COMMA all right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'll put the blindfold on .PERIOD 
Give them an extra mix up .PERIOD 
No messing around this time .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA go ahead ,COMMA mix them up .PERIOD 
My hand is at life ,COMMA here ,COMMA so -DASH -DASH at risk .PERIOD 
Tell me when you're done .PERIOD 
Done .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA where are you ?QUESTIONMARK Put out your hand .PERIOD 
Tell me when I'm over a cup .PERIOD 
You're over a cup .PERIOD 
I'm over a cup ,COMMA right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mm-hmm .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA do you think it's here ?QUESTIONMARK Yes or no ?QUESTIONMARK 
Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I told you I'd have the last laugh .PERIOD 
I don't think it's there .PERIOD 
No ?QUESTIONMARK Good decision .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if I go this way ,COMMA is there another cup over here ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we do the left hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD He asked me could he do the left hand .PERIOD Absolutely not .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if I go this way ,COMMA is there another cup ?QUESTIONMARK 
There's a cup that way ,COMMA yes .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD 
There ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is your decision ,COMMA not mine .PERIOD 
I'm going to say no .PERIOD 
Good decision .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA give me both hands .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA put them on both cups .PERIOD 
Do you think the spike is under your left hand ,COMMA or under your right hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Uh ,COMMA neither .PERIOD 
But if you were to guess .PERIOD 
I think it's under my right hand .PERIOD 
You think it's under your right hand ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA remember ,COMMA you made all the decisions all along .PERIOD 
Psychologists ,COMMA figure this out .PERIOD 
Have a look .PERIOD 
Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on ,COMMA I'll be outside .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Is there anything unique about human beings ?QUESTIONMARK 
There is .PERIOD 
We're obsessed with morality as social creatures .PERIOD 
We need to know why people are doing what they're doing .PERIOD 
And I personally am obsessed with morality .PERIOD 
It was all due to this woman ,COMMA Sister Mary Marastela ,COMMA also known as my mom .PERIOD 
As an altar boy ,COMMA I breathed in a lot of incense ,COMMA and I learned to say phrases in Latin ,COMMA but I also had time to think about whether my mother's top-down morality applied to everybody .PERIOD 
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious were equally obsessed with morality .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA maybe there's some earthly basis for moral decisions .PERIOD 
But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .PERIOD 
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality .PERIOD 
I want to know if there was a moral molecule .PERIOD 
Would you like to see it ?QUESTIONMARK I brought some with me .PERIOD 
This little syringe contains the moral molecule .PERIOD 
It's called oxytocin .PERIOD 
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals .PERIOD 
In rodents ,COMMA it was known to make mothers care for their offspring ,COMMA and in some creatures ,COMMA allowed for toleration of burrowmates .PERIOD 
But in humans ,COMMA it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women ,COMMA and is released by both sexes during sex .PERIOD 
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .PERIOD 
I did what most of us do -DASH -DASH I tried it on some colleagues .PERIOD 
One of them told me ,COMMA Paul ,COMMA that is the world's stupidist idea .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA he said ,COMMA only a female molecule .PERIOD 
But I countered ,COMMA Well men's brains make this too .PERIOD 
There must be a reason why .PERIOD 
But he was right ,COMMA it was a stupid idea .PERIOD 
But it was testably stupid .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA I thought I could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA oxytocin is a shy molecule .PERIOD 
Baseline levels are near zero ,COMMA without some stimulus to cause its release .PERIOD 
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin ,COMMA have to grab it fast and keep it cold .PERIOD 
I think I can do that .PERIOD 
Now luckily ,COMMA oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood ,COMMA so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery .PERIOD 
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project .PERIOD 
I studied one single virtue :COLON trustworthiness .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK I had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .PERIOD 
So in these countries ,COMMA more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created ,COMMA alleviating poverty .PERIOD 
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness ,COMMA I might help alleviate poverty .PERIOD 
But I'm also a skeptic .PERIOD 
I don't want to just ask people ,COMMA Are you trustworthy ?QUESTIONMARK 
So instead I use the Jerry Maguire approach to research .PERIOD 
If you're so virtuous ,COMMA show me the money .PERIOD 
So what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money .PERIOD 
Let me show you how we do that .PERIOD 
They all get $10 if they agree to show up .PERIOD 
Then we match them in pairs by computer .PERIOD 
And in that pair ,COMMA one person gets a message saying ,COMMA Do you want to give up some of your $10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ?QUESTIONMARK 
The trick is you can't see them ,COMMA you can't talk to them .PERIOD 
You only do it one time .PERIOD 
Now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person's account .PERIOD 
You're going to make them a lot wealthier .PERIOD 
And they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .PERIOD 
Do you want to keep it all ,COMMA or do you want to send some amount back ?QUESTIONMARK 
You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .PERIOD 
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .PERIOD 
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger ?QUESTIONMARK 
So this was the birth of vampire economics .PERIOD 
Make a decision and give me some blood .PERIOD 
So in fact ,COMMA experimental economists had run this test around the world ,COMMA and for much higher stakes ,COMMA and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust ,COMMA and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money .PERIOD 
They assumed money is good ,COMMA why not keep it all ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's not what we found .PERIOD 
We found <NUM> percent of the first decision-makers sent money ,COMMA and of those who received money ,COMMA <NUM> percent returned some of it .PERIOD 
Well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received ,COMMA the more their brain produced oxytocin ,COMMA and the more oxytocin on board ,COMMA the more money they returned .PERIOD 
So we have a biology of trustworthiness .PERIOD 
But wait .PERIOD What's wrong with this experiment ?QUESTIONMARK 
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .PERIOD 
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin ,COMMA but they didn't have any effect .PERIOD 
But the second is that I still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .PERIOD 
So to make the experiment ,COMMA I knew I'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly .PERIOD 
And I found I could do it with a nasal inhaler .PERIOD 
So along with colleagues in Zurich ,COMMA we put <NUM> men on oxytocin or placebo ,COMMA had that same trust test with money ,COMMA and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust ,COMMA we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger -DASH -DASH all without altering mood or cognition .PERIOD 
So oxytocin is the trust molecule ,COMMA but is it the moral molecule ?QUESTIONMARK 
Using the oxytocin inhaler ,COMMA we ran more studies .PERIOD 
We showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
We showed it increases donations to charity by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
We've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA my mom was happy about that last one .PERIOD 
And whenever we raise oxytocin ,COMMA people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers .PERIOD 
But why do they do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
What does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin ?QUESTIONMARK 
To investigate this question ,COMMA we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son ,COMMA and his son has terminal brain cancer .PERIOD 
After they watched the video ,COMMA we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .PERIOD 
The change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .PERIOD 
So it's empathy that makes us connect to other people .PERIOD 
It's empathy that makes us help other people .PERIOD 
It's empathy that makes us moral .PERIOD 
Now this idea is not new .PERIOD 
A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith wrote a book in <NUM> called The Theory of Moral Sentiments .PERIOD 
He said we're social creatures ,COMMA so we share the emotions of others .PERIOD 
So I tend to avoid that .PERIOD 
If I do something that makes you happy ,COMMA I get to share your joy .PERIOD 
So I tend to do those things .PERIOD 
Now this is the same Adam Smith who ,COMMA <NUM> years later ,COMMA would write a little book called The Wealth of Nations -DASH -DASH the founding document of economics .PERIOD 
But he was ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a moral philosopher ,COMMA and he was right on why we're moral .PERIOD 
I just found the molecule behind it .PERIOD 
But knowing that molecule is valuable ,COMMA because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .PERIOD 
In particular ,COMMA it tells us why we see immorality .PERIOD 
So to investigate immorality ,COMMA let me bring you back now to <NUM> .PERIOD 
You sit in a gas station all day ,COMMA you see lots of morality and immorality ,COMMA let me tell you .PERIOD 
So one Sunday afternoon ,COMMA a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box .PERIOD 
Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA I was in the men's room .PERIOD 
I just found this .PERIOD What do you think we should do with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't know ,COMMA put it in the lost and found .PERIOD 
Well this is very valuable .PERIOD 
We have to find the owner for this .PERIOD I said ,COMMA Yea .PERIOD 
So we're trying to decide what to do with this ,COMMA and the phone rings .PERIOD 
And a man says very excitedly ,COMMA I was in your gas station a while ago ,COMMA and I bought this jewelry for my wife ,COMMA and I can't find it .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Pearl necklace ?QUESTIONMARK Yeah .PERIOD 
Hey ,COMMA a guy just found it .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA you're saving my life .PERIOD Here's my phone number .PERIOD 
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward .PERIOD 
Great ,COMMA so I tell the guy ,COMMA Look ,COMMA relax .PERIOD 
Get yourself a fat reward .PERIOD Life's good .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA I can't do it .PERIOD 
I have this job interview in Galena in <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and I need this job ,COMMA I've got to go .PERIOD 
Again he asked me ,COMMA What do you think we should do ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm in high school .PERIOD I have no idea .PERIOD 
So I said ,COMMA I'll hold it for you .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA you've been so nice ,COMMA let's split the reward .PERIOD 
I'll give you the jewelry ,COMMA you give me a hundred dollars ,COMMA and when the guy comes .. .PERIOD You see it .PERIOD I was conned .PERIOD 
So the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him ,COMMA it's that he shows he trusts the victim .PERIOD 
Now we know what happens .PERIOD 
The victim's brain releases oxytocin ,COMMA and you're opening up your wallet or purse ,COMMA giving away the money .PERIOD 
So who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?QUESTIONMARK 
We found ,COMMA testing thousands of individuals ,COMMA that five percent of the population don't release oxytocin on stimulus .PERIOD 
So if you trust them ,COMMA their brains don't release oxytocin .PERIOD 
If there's money on the table ,COMMA they keep it all .PERIOD 
So there's a technical word for these people in my lab .PERIOD 
We call them bastards .PERIOD 
These are not people you want to have a beer with .PERIOD 
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited .PERIOD 
You need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA high stress inhibits oxytocin .PERIOD 
So we all know this ,COMMA when we're really stressed out ,COMMA we're not acting our best .PERIOD 
There's another way oxytocin is inhibited ,COMMA which is interesting -DASH -DASH through the action of testosterone .PERIOD 
So we ,COMMA in experiments ,COMMA have administered testosterone to men .PERIOD 
And instead of sharing money ,COMMA they become selfish .PERIOD 
But interestingly ,COMMA high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .PERIOD 
Now think about this .PERIOD It means ,COMMA within our own biology ,COMMA we have the yin and yang of morality .PERIOD 
We have oxytocin that connects us to others ,COMMA makes us feel what they feel .PERIOD 
And we have testosterone .PERIOD 
And men have <NUM> times the testosterone as women ,COMMA so men do this more than women -DASH -DASH we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally .PERIOD 
We don't need God or government telling us what to do .PERIOD 
It's all inside of us .PERIOD 
So you may be wondering :COLON these are beautiful laboratory experiments ,COMMA do they really apply to real life ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yeah ,COMMA I've been worrying about that too .PERIOD 
So I've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives .PERIOD 
So last summer ,COMMA I attended a wedding in Southern England .PERIOD 
<NUM> people in this beautiful Victorian mansion .PERIOD 
I didn't know a single person .PERIOD 
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall .PERIOD 
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .PERIOD 
And I took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .PERIOD 
And guess what ?QUESTIONMARK 
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin ,COMMA but they do so in a very particular way .PERIOD 
Who is the center of the wedding solar system ?QUESTIONMARK 
The bride .PERIOD 
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride ?QUESTIONMARK 
Her mother ,COMMA that's right .PERIOD 
Her mother was number two .PERIOD 
Then the groom's father ,COMMA then the groom ,COMMA then the family ,COMMA then the friends -DASH -DASH arrayed around the bride like planets around the Sun .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .PERIOD 
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .PERIOD 
So even though I have a fear of heights ,COMMA I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at <NUM> ft .PERIOD 
I took my blood before and after ,COMMA and I had a huge spike of oxytocin .PERIOD 
And there are so many ways we can connect to people .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA through social media .PERIOD 
Many people are Tweeting right now .PERIOD 
So we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .PERIOD 
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System .PERIOD 
And they had the reporters and their producers participate .PERIOD 
And one of these guys ,COMMA he must have been <NUM> ,COMMA he had <NUM> percent spike in oxytocin .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA astounding ;SEMICOLON no one has this .PERIOD 
So he was using social media in private .PERIOD 
When I wrote my report to the Koreans ,COMMA I said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I don't know what this guy was doing ,COMMA but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend .PERIOD 
They checked .PERIOD 
He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page .PERIOD 
There you go .PERIOD That's connection .PERIOD 
So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people ,COMMA and it seems to be universal .PERIOD 
Two weeks ago ,COMMA I just got back from Papua New Guinea where I went up to the highlands -DASH -DASH very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> different languages in the highlands .PERIOD 
These are the most primitive people in the world .PERIOD 
And they indeed also release oxytocin .PERIOD 
So oxytocin connects us to other people .PERIOD 
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel .PERIOD 
And it's so easy to cause people's brains to release oxytocin .PERIOD 
I know how to do it ,COMMA and my favorite way to do it is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the easiest .PERIOD 
Let me show it to you .PERIOD 
Come here .PERIOD Give me a hug .PERIOD 
There you go .PERIOD 
I'm happy to share a little more love in the world ,COMMA it's great ,COMMA but here's your prescription from Dr .PERIOD Love :COLON eight hugs a day .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD Love says eight hugs a day .PERIOD 
Eight hugs a day -DASH -DASH you'll be happier and the world will be a better place .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA if you don't like to touch people ,COMMA I can always shove this up your nose .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD Ooh ,COMMA I'm like ,COMMA Phew ,COMMA phew ,COMMA calm down .PERIOD Get back into my body now .PERIOD 
Usually when I play out ,COMMA the first thing that happens is people scream out ,COMMA What's she doing ?QUESTIONMARK !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And then I'll kind of be like -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and then they're like ,COMMA Whoa !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I'm sure you're trying to figure out ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how does this thing work ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA what I'm doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA the closer I get to this antenna ,COMMA the higher the note gets -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and you can get it really low .PERIOD 
And with this hand I'm controlling the volume ,COMMA so the further away my right hand gets ,COMMA the louder it gets .PERIOD 
Sometimes I startle myself :COLON I'll forget that I have it on ,COMMA and I'll lean over to pick up something ,COMMA and then it goes like -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don't turn the thing off .PERIOD 
We're going to do a song by David Mash called Listen :COLON the Words Are Gone ,COMMA and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked ;SEMICOLON there are so many .PERIOD 
And .. .PERIOD Well ,COMMA I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin .PERIOD 
And there'd be that sound in the signal -DASH -DASH it's like -DASH -DASH and he thought ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument ,COMMA because there are pitches in it .PERIOD 
And so somehow through developing that ,COMMA he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now .PERIOD 
And a lot of times ,COMMA even kids nowadays ,COMMA they'll make reference to a theremin by going ,COMMA Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo ,COMMA because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies ,COMMA that sound that's like .. .PERIOD 
It's kind of a funny ,COMMA goofy sound to do .PERIOD 
And sometimes if I have too much coffee ,COMMA then my vibrato gets out of hand .PERIOD 
You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind this thing .PERIOD 
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control .PERIOD 
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -DASH -DASH what Michael was doing -DASH -DASH because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune ,COMMA and at the same time you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time ;SEMICOLON you want to be feeling the music .PERIOD 
If I pass out on the next song .. .PERIOD 
I think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing ,COMMA or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing ;SEMICOLON you don't want to have any sudden movements .PERIOD 
And if I go to a club and play a gig ,COMMA people are like ,COMMA Here ,COMMA have some drinks on us !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And it's like ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I'm about to go on soon ;SEMICOLON I don't want to be like -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
It really does reflect the mood that you're in also ,COMMA if you're .. .PERIOD 
it's similar to being a vocalist ,COMMA except instead of it coming out of your throat ,COMMA you're controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference ;SEMICOLON you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly .PERIOD 
You just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it ,COMMA adjust it ,COMMA and just move on ,COMMA or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy .PERIOD Like me .PERIOD 
I think we will play another tune now .PERIOD 
I'm going to do Lush Life .PERIOD It's one of my favorite tunes to play .PERIOD 
This is Shivdutt Yadav ,COMMA and he's from Uttar Pradesh ,COMMA India .PERIOD 
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office in Uttar Pradesh ,COMMA and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead .PERIOD 
His land was no longer registered in his name .PERIOD 
His brothers ,COMMA Chandrabhan and Phoolchand ,COMMA were also listed as dead .PERIOD 
Family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land by having the brothers declared dead ,COMMA allowing them to inherit their father's share of the ancestral farmland .PERIOD 
Because of this ,COMMA all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home .PERIOD 
According to the Yadav family ,COMMA the local court has been scheduling a case review since <NUM> ,COMMA but a judge has never appeared .PERIOD 
There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review .PERIOD 
Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property led to this corruption .PERIOD 
He was laid to rest in the Ganges River ,COMMA where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water .PERIOD 
Photographing these brothers was a disorienting exchange because on paper they don't exist ,COMMA and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA these men remain dead .PERIOD 
This quandary led to the title of the project ,COMMA which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent ghosts of the past and the future .PERIOD 
So this story is the first of <NUM> chapters in my new body of work titled A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters .PERIOD 
And for this work ,COMMA I traveled around the world over a four-year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related stories .PERIOD 
I was interested in ideas surrounding fate and whether our fate is determined by blood ,COMMA chance or circumstance .PERIOD 
The subjects I documented ranged from feuding families in Brazil to victims of genocide in Bosnia to the first woman to hijack an airplane and the living dead in India .PERIOD 
In each chapter ,COMMA you can see the external forces of governance ,COMMA power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance .PERIOD 
Each work that I make is comprised of three segments .PERIOD 
On the left are one or more portrait panels in which I systematically order the members of a given bloodline .PERIOD 
This is followed by a text panel ,COMMA it's designed in scroll form ,COMMA in which I construct the narrative at stake .PERIOD 
And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel .PERIOD 
It's a space that's more intuitive in which I present fragments of the story ,COMMA beginnings of other stories ,COMMA photographic evidence .PERIOD 
So it's more disordered .PERIOD 
And this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline .PERIOD 
In my past projects I've often worked in serial form ,COMMA documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA are fairly abstract .PERIOD 
In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction and find an absolute catalog ,COMMA something that I couldn't interrupt ,COMMA curate or edit by choice .PERIOD 
This led me to blood .PERIOD 
A bloodline is determined and ordered .PERIOD 
But the project centers on the collision of order and disorder -DASH -DASH the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters .PERIOD 
In chapter two ,COMMA I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin .PERIOD 
He oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company whose work led to the establishment of a Jewish state .PERIOD 
Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem ,COMMA I wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the Jewish state .PERIOD 
And I found these maps which you see here .PERIOD 
And these are studies commissioned by the Zionist organization for alternative areas for Jewish settlement .PERIOD 
In this ,COMMA I was interested in the consequences of geography and imagining how the world would be different if Israel were in Uganda ,COMMA which is what these maps demonstrate .PERIOD 
These archives in Jerusalem ,COMMA they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to Palestine ,COMMA and later Israel ,COMMA from <NUM> to <NUM> .PERIOD 
Chapter three :COLON Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo treated patients outside of Kisumu ,COMMA Kenya for AIDS ,COMMA tuberculosis ,COMMA infertility ,COMMA mental illness ,COMMA evil spirits .PERIOD 
He's most often paid for his services in cash ,COMMA cows or goats .PERIOD 
But sometimes when his female patients can't afford his services ,COMMA their families give the women to Jura in exchange for medical treatment .PERIOD 
As a result of these transactions ,COMMA Jura has nine wives ,COMMA <NUM> children and <NUM> grandchildren .PERIOD 
In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here .PERIOD 
Two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them ,COMMA three for evil spirits ,COMMA one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love ,COMMA paying their families a total of <NUM> cows .PERIOD 
One wife deserted him and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits .PERIOD 
Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya .PERIOD 
It's common among a privileged class capable of paying numerous dowries and keeping multiple homes .PERIOD 
Instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth ,COMMA status and power .PERIOD 
You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed there are empty portraits .PERIOD 
These empty portraits represent individuals ,COMMA living individuals ,COMMA who couldn't be present .PERIOD 
And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel .PERIOD 
They include dengue fever ,COMMA imprisonment ,COMMA army service ,COMMA women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons .PERIOD 
And in this particular chapter ,COMMA it's children whose mothers wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it .PERIOD 
Twenty-four European rabbits were brought to Australia in <NUM> by a British settler for sporting purposes ,COMMA for hunting .PERIOD 
And within a hundred years ,COMMA that population of <NUM> had exploded to half a billion .PERIOD 
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia ,COMMA and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land .PERIOD 
Since the 1950s ,COMMA Australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth .PERIOD 
These rabbits were bred at a government facility ,COMMA Biosecurity Queensland ,COMMA where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them .PERIOD 
So they're testing its virulence .PERIOD 
Haigh's Chocolate ,COMMA in collaboration with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia ,COMMA stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby .PERIOD 
Now this was done to counter the annual celebration of rabbits and presumably make the public more comfortable with the killing of rabbits and promote an animal that's native to Australia ,COMMA and actually an animal that is threatened by the European rabbit .PERIOD 
In chapter seven ,COMMA I focus on the effects of a genocidal act on one bloodline .PERIOD 
So over a two-day period ,COMMA six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the Srebrenica massacre .PERIOD 
This is the only work in which I visually represent the dead .PERIOD 
But I only represent those that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre ,COMMA which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War .PERIOD 
And during this massacre ,COMMA <NUM> Bosnian Muslim men and boys were systematically executed .PERIOD 
Her name is Zumra .PERIOD 
She is followed by her four children ,COMMA all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre .PERIOD 
Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well .PERIOD 
And I was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains .PERIOD 
They've all been given a proper burial ,COMMA so what remains are these blue slides at the International Commission for Missing Persons .PERIOD 
These are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory ,COMMA which was where the Dutch U.N .PERIOD soldiers were staying ,COMMA and also the Serbian soldiers later during the times of the executions .PERIOD 
This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial ,COMMA which from top to bottom shows a Serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an Orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them .PERIOD 
Chapter <NUM> is more of a performance piece .PERIOD 
I solicited China's State Council Information Office in <NUM> to select a multi-generational bloodline to represent China for this project .PERIOD 
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size ,COMMA and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice .PERIOD 
This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits .PERIOD 
Everyone showed up .PERIOD 
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .PERIOD 
Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda ,COMMA the State Council Information Office is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations .PERIOD 
It controls all foreign media and image production outside of China from foreign media working within China .PERIOD 
It also monitors the Internet and instructs local media on how to handle any potentially controversial issues ,COMMA including Tibet ,COMMA ethnic minorities ,COMMA Human Rights ,COMMA religion ,COMMA democracy movements and terrorism .PERIOD 
For the footnote panel in this work ,COMMA this office instructed me to photograph their central television tower in Beijing .PERIOD 
And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me when I left .PERIOD 
These are the descendants of Hans Frank who was Hitler's personal legal advisor and governor general of occupied Poland .PERIOD 
Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits ,COMMA highlighting a complex relationship to one's family history .PERIOD 
The reasons for these absences include people who declined participation .PERIOD 
Another section of the family presented their clothing ,COMMA as opposed to their physical presence ,COMMA because they didn't want to be identified with the past that I was highlighting .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation ,COMMA so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable .PERIOD 
In the footnote panel that accompanies this work I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by British Intelligence with Hans Frank's image on it .PERIOD 
These paintings were taken by Hans Frank during the time of the Third Reich .PERIOD 
And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time .PERIOD 
They are Leonardo da Vinci's Lady With an Ermine ,COMMA Rembrandt's Landscape With Good Samaritan and Raphael's Portrait of a Youth ,COMMA which has never been found .PERIOD 
So this is the Ferraz family and the Novaes family .PERIOD 
And they are in an active blood feud .PERIOD 
This feud has been going on since <NUM> in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco ,COMMA and it involved the deaths of <NUM> members of the families and <NUM> others associated with the feud ,COMMA including hired hit men ,COMMA innocent bystanders and friends .PERIOD 
Tensions between these two families date back to <NUM> when there was a dispute over local political power .PERIOD 
But it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors .PERIOD 
Installed into a protective wall surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes ,COMMA who's the head of the Novaes family ,COMMA are these turret holes ,COMMA which were used for shooting and looking .PERIOD 
Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco is one of the nation's most violent regions .PERIOD 
It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice ,COMMA or an eye for an eye ,COMMA so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area .PERIOD 
This story ,COMMA like many of the stories in my chapters ,COMMA reads almost as an archetypal episode ,COMMA like something out of Shakespeare ,COMMA that's happening now and will happen again in the future .PERIOD 
I'm interested in these ideas of repetition .PERIOD 
So after I returned home ,COMMA I received word that one member of the family had been shot <NUM> times in the face .PERIOD 
Chapter <NUM> is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history .PERIOD 
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and <NUM> .PERIOD 
This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood .PERIOD 
In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage ,COMMA only one child had been adopted .PERIOD 
Children have to leave the orphanage at age <NUM> ,COMMA despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go .PERIOD 
It's commonly reported in Ukraine that children ,COMMA when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking ,COMMA child pornography and prostitution .PERIOD 
Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival ,COMMA and high rates of suicide are recorded .PERIOD 
This is a boys' bedroom .PERIOD 
There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage and not enough warm clothing .PERIOD 
Children bathe infrequently because the hot water isn't turned on until October .PERIOD 
This is a girls' bedroom .PERIOD 
And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer ,COMMA four vacuum cleaners ,COMMA two computers ,COMMA a video projector ,COMMA a copy machine ,COMMA winter shoes and a dentist's drill .PERIOD 
This photograph ,COMMA which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms ,COMMA shows a sign which I had translated when I got home .PERIOD 
And it reads :COLON Those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future .PERIOD 
There are many more chapters in this project .PERIOD 
This is just an abridged rendering of over a thousand images .PERIOD 
And this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive .PERIOD 
And within this accumulation of images and texts ,COMMA I'm struggling to find patterns and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead are just as coded as blood itself .PERIOD 
But archives exist because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated .PERIOD 
Something is said in the gaps between all the information that's collected .PERIOD 
And there's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between .PERIOD 
It's almost machine-like the way people are born and people die ,COMMA and the stories keep coming and coming .PERIOD 
And in this ,COMMA I'm considering ,COMMA is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution ,COMMA or are we on repeat over and over again ?QUESTIONMARK 
Thank you .PERIOD 
But anyway ,COMMA it's just great to see such a full theater ,COMMA and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .PERIOD 
One of the interesting things ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology ,COMMA and of course what he said about listening to our young people .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA my job is all about listening ,COMMA and my aim ,COMMA really ,COMMA is to teach the world to listen .PERIOD 
That's my only real aim in life .PERIOD 
Because you know ,COMMA when you look at a piece of music -DASH -DASH for example ,COMMA if I just open my little motorbike bag -DASH -DASH we have here ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we open it up and I read the music .PERIOD 
So technically ,COMMA I can actually read this .PERIOD 
I will do exactly as I'm told .PERIOD 
And so therefore ,COMMA because time is short ,COMMA if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so .PERIOD It's very straightforward .PERIOD 
There's nothing too difficult about the piece .PERIOD 
I'm being told where to play on the drum .PERIOD 
I'm being told which part of the stick to use .PERIOD 
And I'm being told the dynamic .PERIOD 
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares .PERIOD 
Snares on ,COMMA snares off .PERIOD 
So therefore ,COMMA if I translate this piece of music ,COMMA we have this idea .PERIOD 
And so on .PERIOD My career would probably last about five years .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .PERIOD 
Everything that there isn't time to learn from a teacher ,COMMA or to talk about ,COMMA even ,COMMA from a teacher .PERIOD 
But it's the things that you notice when you're not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting ,COMMA and that you want to explore through this tiny ,COMMA tiny surface of a drum .PERIOD 
So there ,COMMA we experience the translation .PERIOD Now we'll experience the interpretation .PERIOD 
Now my career may last a little longer !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
But in a way ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .PERIOD 
I see that you're clutching a teddy bear ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about ,COMMA what you might like ,COMMA what you might do as a profession ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA that's just ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look ,COMMA and we try to interpret ,COMMA but actually it's so unbelievably shallow .PERIOD 
In the same way ,COMMA I look at the music ;SEMICOLON I get a basic idea ;SEMICOLON I wonder what technically might be hard ,COMMA or ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what I want to do .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA that is simply not enough .PERIOD 
And I think what Herbie said -DASH -DASH please listen ,COMMA listen .PERIOD 
If I play ,COMMA for example ,COMMA holding the stick -DASH -DASH where literally I do not let go of the stick -DASH -DASH you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .PERIOD 
And you feel really quite -DASH -DASH believe it or not -DASH -DASH detached from the instrument and from the stick ,COMMA even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly .PERIOD 
By holding it tightly ,COMMA I feel strangely more detached .PERIOD 
If I just simply let go and allow my hand ,COMMA my arm ,COMMA to be more of a support system ,COMMA suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort .PERIOD Much more .PERIOD 
And I'm doing far ,COMMA far less .PERIOD 
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument ,COMMA I need time with people in order to interpret them .PERIOD 
If ,COMMA for example ,COMMA I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -DASH -DASH that is ,COMMA someone who is basically a percussion player .. .PERIOD 
And so on .PERIOD If I think of myself as a musician .. .PERIOD 
And so on .PERIOD There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH thinking about .PERIOD 
And I remember when I was <NUM> years old ,COMMA and I started playing tympani and percussion ,COMMA and my teacher said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how are we going to do this ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA music is about listening .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA I agree with that .PERIOD So what's the problem ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how are you going to hear this ?QUESTIONMARK How are you going to hear that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how do you hear it ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I think I hear it through here .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I think I do too -DASH -DASH but I also hear it through my hands ,COMMA through my arms ,COMMA cheekbones ,COMMA my scalp ,COMMA my tummy ,COMMA my chest ,COMMA my legs and so on .PERIOD 
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -DASH -DASH in particular ,COMMA the kettle drums ,COMMA or tympani -DASH -DASH to such a narrow pitch interval ,COMMA so something like .. .PERIOD 
that of a difference .PERIOD Then gradually .. .PERIOD and gradually .. .PERIOD 
and it's amazing that when you do open your body up ,COMMA and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through ,COMMA that in fact the tiny ,COMMA tiny difference .. .PERIOD 
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room ,COMMA and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments ,COMMA and really try to connect with those sounds far ,COMMA far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .PERIOD 
Because of course ,COMMA the ear is ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA subject to all sorts of things .PERIOD 
The room we happen to be in ,COMMA the amplification ,COMMA the quality of the instrument ,COMMA the type of sticks .. .PERIOD etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
They're all different .PERIOD 
Same amount of weight ,COMMA but different sound colors .PERIOD 
And that's basically what we are .PERIOD We're just human beings ,COMMA but we all have our own little sound colors ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things .PERIOD 
And as I grew older ,COMMA I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA no ,COMMA we won't accept you ,COMMA because we haven't a clue ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of the future of a so-called 'deaf' musician .PERIOD 
And I just couldn't quite accept that .PERIOD 
And so therefore ,COMMA I said to them ,COMMA Well ,COMMA look ,COMMA if you refuse -DASH -DASH if you refuse me through those reasons ,COMMA as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -DASH -DASH then we have to think very ,COMMA very hard about the people you do actually accept .PERIOD 
And as a result -DASH -DASH once we got over a little hurdle ,COMMA and having to audition twice -DASH -DASH they accepted me .PERIOD And not only that -DASH -DASH what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom .PERIOD 
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms ,COMMA no legs -DASH -DASH they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .PERIOD 
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .PERIOD 
And every single entry had to be listened to ,COMMA experienced and then based on the musical ability -DASH -DASH then that person could either enter or not .PERIOD 
So therefore ,COMMA this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .PERIOD 
And I have to say ,COMMA many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .PERIOD 
The interesting thing about this as well ,COMMA though -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -DASH -DASH which is basically all of us ,COMMA and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .PERIOD 
I say music ,COMMA but actually I mean sound .PERIOD 
Because you know ,COMMA some of the extraordinary things I've experienced as a musician ,COMMA when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges ,COMMA who may not be able to control his movements ,COMMA who may be deaf ,COMMA who may be blind ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -DASH -DASH suddenly ,COMMA if that young lad sits close to this instrument ,COMMA and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba ,COMMA and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like ,COMMA almost -DASH -DASH I don't really have the right sticks ,COMMA perhaps -DASH -DASH but something like this .PERIOD Let me change .PERIOD 
Something that's so unbelievably simple -DASH -DASH but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn't be ,COMMA because I'm on top of the sound .PERIOD 
I have the sound coming this way .PERIOD 
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .PERIOD 
If there were no resonators on here ,COMMA we would have .. .PERIOD 
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn't experience ,COMMA those of you in the back few rows wouldn't experience either .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA being the participator of the sound ,COMMA and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -DASH -DASH for example ,COMMA this sound .PERIOD 
Can you hear anything ?QUESTIONMARK 
Exactly .PERIOD Because I'm not even touching it .PERIOD 
But yet ,COMMA we get the sensation of something happening .PERIOD 
In the same way that when I see tree moves ,COMMA then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound .PERIOD 
Do you see what I mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
Whatever the eye sees ,COMMA then there's always sound happening .PERIOD 
So there's always ,COMMA always that huge -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .PERIOD 
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience ,COMMA and not by learning a piece of music ,COMMA putting on someone else's interpretation of it ,COMMA buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music ,COMMA and so on and so forth .PERIOD 
Because that isn't giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic ,COMMA and something that I can fully experience the journey of .PERIOD 
So it may be that ,COMMA in certain halls ,COMMA this dynamic may well work .PERIOD 
It may be that in other halls ,COMMA they're simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore ,COMMA my level of soft ,COMMA gentle playing may have to be .. .PERIOD 
But it's meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together .PERIOD There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics ,COMMA dare I say .PERIOD But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .PERIOD 
The tiniest ,COMMA softest ,COMMA softest sound to something that is so broad ,COMMA so huge ,COMMA so incredible !EXCLAMATIONMARK There's always something -DASH -DASH it may sound good up there ,COMMA may not be so good there .PERIOD 
Maybe terrible over there ,COMMA but not too bad there ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
So to find an actual hall is incredible -DASH -DASH for which you can play exactly what you imagine ,COMMA without it being cosmetically enhanced .PERIOD 
And so therefore ,COMMA acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired ,COMMA and who are participators of sound .PERIOD 
And this is quite interesting .PERIOD 
I cannot ,COMMA you know ,COMMA give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls ,COMMA but it's just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we've been saying ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how on Earth can they experience music ?QUESTIONMARK You know ,COMMA they're deaf .PERIOD 
Or we go like that ,COMMA and we imagine that's what blindness is about .PERIOD 
If we see someone in a wheelchair ,COMMA we assume they cannot walk .PERIOD 
It may be that they can walk three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five steps .PERIOD That ,COMMA to them ,COMMA means they can walk .PERIOD 
In another year's time ,COMMA three extra steps .PERIOD 
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .PERIOD 
So when we do listen to each other ,COMMA it's unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills ,COMMA to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber ,COMMA to stop the judgment .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time .PERIOD 
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music ,COMMA but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA it's just one of the great things about being a musician ,COMMA is that it is so unbelievably fluid .PERIOD 
So there are no rules ,COMMA no right ,COMMA no wrong ,COMMA this way ,COMMA that way .PERIOD 
If I asked you to clap -DASH -DASH maybe I can do this .PERIOD 
If I can just say ,COMMA Please clap and create the sound of thunder .PERIOD 
I'm assuming we've all experienced thunder .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I don't mean just the sound ;SEMICOLON I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON No .PERIOD 
Try again .PERIOD Snow .PERIOD 
Rain .PERIOD Not bad .PERIOD Not bad .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the interesting thing here ,COMMA though ,COMMA is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .PERIOD 
Now -DASH -DASH great imagination ,COMMA thank you very much .PERIOD 
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .PERIOD 
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds .PERIOD 
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .PERIOD 
In the same way that when we listen to music ,COMMA we assume that it's all being fed through here .PERIOD 
This is how we experience music .PERIOD Of course it's not .PERIOD 
We experience thunder -DASH -DASH thunder ,COMMA thunder .PERIOD Think ,COMMA think ,COMMA think .PERIOD 
Listen ,COMMA listen ,COMMA listen .PERIOD Now -DASH -DASH what can we do with thunder ?QUESTIONMARK 
I remember my teacher .PERIOD When I first started ,COMMA my very first lesson ,COMMA I was all prepared with sticks ,COMMA ready to go .PERIOD 
And instead of him saying ,COMMA OK ,COMMA Evelyn ,COMMA please ,COMMA feet slightly apart ,COMMA arms at a more-or-less <NUM> degree angle ,COMMA sticks in a more-or-less V shape ,COMMA keep this amount of space here ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
Please keep your back straight ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -DASH -DASH where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid ,COMMA frozen ,COMMA and I would not be able to strike the drum ,COMMA because I was thinking of so many other things -DASH -DASH he said ,COMMA Evelyn ,COMMA take this drum away for seven days ,COMMA and I'll see you next week .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA heavens !EXCLAMATIONMARK What was I to do ?QUESTIONMARK I no longer required the sticks ;SEMICOLON I wasn't allowed to have these sticks .PERIOD 
I had to basically look at this particular drum ,COMMA see how it was made ,COMMA what these little lugs did ,COMMA what the snares did .PERIOD 
Turned it upside down ,COMMA experimented with the shell ,COMMA experimented with the head .PERIOD 
Experimented with my body ,COMMA experimented with jewelry ,COMMA experimented with all sorts of things .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -DASH -DASH but nevertheless ,COMMA it was such an unbelievable experience ,COMMA because then ,COMMA where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?QUESTIONMARK 
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we never ,COMMA ever dealt with actual study books .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player ,COMMA as opposed to a musician ,COMMA is basically straightforward single stroke rolls .PERIOD 
Like that .PERIOD And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .PERIOD 
And so on and so forth .PERIOD What does this piece require ?QUESTIONMARK 
Single stroke rolls .PERIOD So why can't I then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?QUESTIONMARK 
And that's exactly what he did .PERIOD 
And interestingly ,COMMA the older I became ,COMMA and when I became a full-time student at a so called music institution ,COMMA all of that went out of the window .PERIOD 
We had to study from study books .PERIOD 
And constantly ,COMMA the question ,COMMA Well ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK Why ?QUESTIONMARK What is this relating to ?QUESTIONMARK 
I need to play a piece of music .PERIOD Oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA this will help your control !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA how ?QUESTIONMARK Why do I need to learn that ?QUESTIONMARK I need to relate it to a piece of music .PERIOD 
You know .PERIOD I need to say something .PERIOD 
Why am I practicing paradiddles ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it just literally for control ,COMMA for hand-stick control ?QUESTIONMARK Why am I doing that ?QUESTIONMARK 
I need to have the reason ,COMMA and the reason has to be by saying something through the music .PERIOD 
And by saying something through music ,COMMA which basically is sound ,COMMA we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .PERIOD 
But I don't want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .PERIOD 
That's up to you ,COMMA when you walk through a hall .PERIOD 
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .PERIOD 
So please ,COMMA the next time you go to a concert ,COMMA just allow your body to open up ,COMMA allow your body to be this resonating chamber .PERIOD 
Be aware that you're not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .PERIOD 
They're experiencing that rawness there .PERIOD 
But yet they're experiencing something so unbelievably pure ,COMMA which is before the sound is actually happening .PERIOD 
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike ,COMMA or breath ,COMMA is being pulled .PERIOD Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I'd experienced the whole journey of this particular conference ,COMMA rather than just arriving last night .PERIOD 
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .PERIOD 
But thank you very much for having me !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Tom Green :COLON That's a 4chan thing .PERIOD 
These kids on the Internet ,COMMA they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like barrel roll .PERIOD 
Star Fox <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
Tom Green :COLON Yeah .PERIOD And they've been dogging me for a year .PERIOD 
I got to tell you ,COMMA it's driving me nuts ,COMMA actually .PERIOD 
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream ,COMMA 4chan !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Christopher Poole :COLON When I was <NUM> ,COMMA I found this website called Futaba Channel .PERIOD 
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard .PERIOD 
That format of forum ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA was not well-known outside of Japan .PERIOD 
And so what I did is I took it ,COMMA I translated it into English ,COMMA and I stuck it up for my friends to use .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA six and a half years later ,COMMA over seven million people are using it ,COMMA contributing over <NUM> posts per day .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous ,COMMA and it has no memory .PERIOD 
There's no archive ,COMMA there are no barriers ,COMMA there's no registration .PERIOD 
These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on 4chan .PERIOD 
And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw ,COMMA completely unfiltered .PERIOD 
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats -DASH -DASH just silly pictures of cats with text .PERIOD 
And this resonates with millions of people ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA because there are tens of thousands of these ,COMMA and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these .PERIOD 
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years .. .PERIOD 
Rickroll was this bait and switch ,COMMA really simple ,COMMA classic bait and switch .PERIOD 
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting ,COMMA and you get an '80s pop song .PERIOD That's all it was .PERIOD 
And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade ,COMMA and Rick Astley pops out ,COMMA and rickrolls millions of people on television .PERIOD 
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site .PERIOD 
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream ,COMMA the ones I've just shown you ,COMMA but every day ,COMMA every month ,COMMA people are producing thousands of these .PERIOD 
So does a site like this have rules ?QUESTIONMARK 
We do ;SEMICOLON they're the codified rules that I've come up with ,COMMA which are more-or-less ignored by the community .PERIOD 
And so they've come up with their own set of rules ,COMMA the Rules of the Internet .PERIOD 
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/ .PERIOD 
Two is you do not talk about /b/ .PERIOD 
And this one's kind of interesting :COLON If it exists ,COMMA there is porn of it .PERIOD No exceptions .PERIOD 
And I will spare you that slide .PERIOD 
I assure you ,COMMA it is very true .PERIOD 
/b/ is the first board we started with ,COMMA and it is ,COMMA in many ways ,COMMA the beating heart of the website .PERIOD 
And /b/ is known for ,COMMA more than anything ,COMMA not just the memes they've created ,COMMA but the exploits .PERIOD 
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago ,COMMA and that was the Time <NUM> poll .PERIOD 
So somebody at Time ,COMMA at the magazine ,COMMA thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year .PERIOD 
And so they placed me on it ,COMMA and the Internet got wind of it .PERIOD My community decided they wanted me to win it .PERIOD 
I didn't instruct them to do it ;SEMICOLON they just decided that that's what they wanted .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> percent approval rating ain't so bad .PERIOD 
So they broke that poll .PERIOD 
And I ended up on top .PERIOD 
I ended up at this really fancy party .PERIOD 
But that's not what's interesting about this .PERIOD 
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list ;SEMICOLON they were actually -DASH -DASH it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top <NUM> places to spell mARBLECAKE .PERIOD ALSO ,COMMA THE GAME .PERIOD 
The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible .PERIOD 
And marble cake is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized .PERIOD 
Anonymous is this group of people that protested ,COMMA very famously ,COMMA Scientology .PERIOD 
The story is ,COMMA Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise .PERIOD It went up online .PERIOD 
And so these people ,COMMA over <NUM> people ,COMMA less than one month later ,COMMA organized in a hundred cities around the globe and -DASH -DASH this is L.A .PERIOD -DASH -DASH protested the Church of Scientology ,COMMA and they have continued to do so ,COMMA now ,COMMA two full years after the fact .PERIOD 
They are still protesting .PERIOD 
And last ,COMMA I'm going to show you the example ,COMMA the story of Dusty the cat .PERIOD 
This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this didn't sit well with people ,COMMA and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this .PERIOD 
So what they did is they -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA they put CSI to shame here -DASH -DASH the Internet detectives came out .PERIOD 
They matched ,COMMA they found his MySpace .PERIOD 
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video .PERIOD 
Within <NUM> hours ,COMMA they had his name ,COMMA and within <NUM> hours ,COMMA he was arrested .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA what I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place .PERIOD 
As I said ,COMMA it's raw ,COMMA it's unfiltered .PERIOD 
And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now .PERIOD 
They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking .PERIOD 
We're moving towards persistent identity .PERIOD 
We're moving towards ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a lack of privacy ,COMMA really .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
Got a couple questions for you .PERIOD 
But if I ask them ,COMMA is the TED website going to go down ?QUESTIONMARK 
But seriously ,COMMA this issue on anonymity is -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA you made the case there .PERIOD 
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything ,COMMA all the rules gone .PERIOD 
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography .PERIOD 
And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box .PERIOD 
Yes and no .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment ,COMMA there is plenty of bad .PERIOD 
There are plenty of downsides .PERIOD 
But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -DASH -DASH there are very few places ,COMMA now ,COMMA where you can go and not have identity ,COMMA to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like .PERIOD 
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line .PERIOD 
But I think it's important to have these places .PERIOD 
When I get emails ,COMMA people say ,COMMA Thank you for giving me this place ,COMMA this outlet ,COMMA where I can come after work and be myself .PERIOD 
But words ,COMMA saying things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA can be constructive ;SEMICOLON it can be really damaging .PERIOD 
And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA surely there are huge risks with that .PERIOD 
There are ,COMMA certainly .PERIOD 
But -DASH -DASH CA :COLON Tell me about what -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA I think you asked the board what you might say at TED ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yeah ,COMMA I posted a thread on Sunday .PERIOD 
And within <NUM> hours ,COMMA it had over <NUM> responses .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of it is just ,COMMA would have been ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bleeped out .PERIOD 
But there were some good things that came out of that too .PERIOD 
Love and peace were mentioned .PERIOD 
Love and peace were mentioned ,COMMA kind of with quote marks around them ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Cats and dogs were mentioned too .PERIOD 
And that content is all off the board now .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA it's gone ?QUESTIONMARK Or is it still up there ?QUESTIONMARK 
I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .PERIOD 
It went up to about <NUM> posts ,COMMA and now it has been taken off .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway .PERIOD 
Chris ,COMMA you yourself ?QUESTIONMARK I mean ,COMMA you're a figure of some intrigue .PERIOD 
What's the commercial picture here ?QUESTIONMARK 
The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one ,COMMA I guess .PERIOD 
The site has adult content on it .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA it's got some very offensive ,COMMA obscene content on it ,COMMA just in terms of language alone .PERIOD 
And when you've got that ,COMMA you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money .PERIOD 
But you still live at home ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I actually moved out recently .PERIOD 
That's very cool .PERIOD 
I got out of Mom's ,COMMA and I'm back in school right now .PERIOD 
But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about 4chan ?QUESTIONMARK 
At first ,COMMA very kind of pained ,COMMA awkward conversations .PERIOD 
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least .PERIOD 
But my parents -DASH -DASH I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it .PERIOD 
And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA in <NUM> years' time ,COMMA what do you picture yourself doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's a good question .PERIOD 
As I said ,COMMA I just went back to school ,COMMA and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning ,COMMA kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community .PERIOD 
Chris ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD Absolutely fascinating .PERIOD Thank you for coming to TED .PERIOD 
Sixty-five million years ago ,COMMA a very important and catastrophic event changed the course of life on land .PERIOD 
And although we know that the land animals I'm going to talk about are just the scum of the Earth on the land -DASH -DASH the little bits of land floating around -DASH -DASH but they are important to us because they're sort of in our scale of experience from millimeters to meters .PERIOD 
And these animals disappeared ,COMMA and a separate life ,COMMA mammals ,COMMA radiated out to take their place .PERIOD And so ,COMMA we know this in extraordinary detail .PERIOD And so this is a core from near Bermuda .PERIOD We know that the tsunamis ,COMMA the earthquakes ,COMMA and the things that we've experienced in the entire record of humankind history can't really quite get around the kind of disaster that this represented for the Earth .PERIOD 
So even before that impact was known ,COMMA even before scientists in general came to an agreement over the theory of evolution ,COMMA scientists and natural historians of all kinds of stripes actually had divided Earth's life's history into these two episodes :COLON Mesozoic ,COMMA the middle life ,COMMA and the Cenozoic ,COMMA the recent life .PERIOD 
And as it turns out ,COMMA it actually corresponds really nicely with geologic history .PERIOD 
So we have a Mesozoic period ,COMMA an age of fragmentation ,COMMA and a Cenozoic period ,COMMA an age of reconnection -DASH -DASH South America to North America ,COMMA India to Asia .PERIOD 
And so my work ,COMMA really ,COMMA is trying to understand the character of that Mesozoic radiation compared to the Cenozoic radiation to see what mysteries we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on drifting continents really can tell us about evolution .PERIOD 
The work immediately begs the question ,COMMA Why didn't they go into the waters ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA certainly mammals did .PERIOD This is one example .PERIOD 
You can go outside -DASH -DASH see many other examples .PERIOD 
Why didn't they hang around in trees at good size ,COMMA and why didn't they burrow ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why didn't they do all these things ,COMMA and if they didn't do all these things ,COMMA what kinds of animals were in those spaces ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if there were no animals in those spaces ,COMMA what does that tell us about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how evolution works on land ?QUESTIONMARK 
Really interesting questions .PERIOD I think a lot of it has to do with body size .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I think that most of it has to do with body size -DASH -DASH the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster .PERIOD 
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it ,COMMA digging it up for many years ,COMMA I end up looking at the mammal radiation ,COMMA and it seems as though everything is quick time ,COMMA just like technology ,COMMA advancing by an order of magnitude .PERIOD 
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace ,COMMA an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .PERIOD 
You want to measure it by the time it took to reach maximum body size ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes ,COMMA they do have larger body size ,COMMA but many of them are smaller ,COMMA but we're interested in the time it took them to achieve that .PERIOD 
Fifty million years to achieve this maximum body size .PERIOD 
And that is <NUM> times longer than it took the mammals to achieve maximum body size and invade all those habitats .PERIOD 
So there's lessons to learn ,COMMA and there's lessons to learn from the exception ,COMMA the exception that we know very well today from the discoveries we've made ,COMMA and many other scholars have made around the world .PERIOD 
We now know this transition is the one time that dinosaurs actually went below that body size -DASH -DASH we're going to see where they began in a minute -DASH -DASH and it is the one time that they rapidly invaded all the habitats I just told you that dinosaurs weren't in .PERIOD 
They became marine .PERIOD We now know them today from the ice caps .PERIOD 
There's burrowing birds .PERIOD 
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes ,COMMA and ,COMMA of course ,COMMA they inhabit the land .PERIOD 
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature .PERIOD 
We called this bird Sinornis .PERIOD It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx ,COMMA and if you go to different layers ,COMMA you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx ,COMMA and every grade in between ,COMMA so that if you find something today ,COMMA we're usually splitting hairs -DASH -DASH or ,COMMA more appropriately ,COMMA feathers -DASH -DASH as to decide whether it's actually a non-avian or an avian .PERIOD 
It is the greatest transition that we have ,COMMA actually ,COMMA on land from one habitat to another ,COMMA bar none ,COMMA to understand how a bony ,COMMA fairly heavy ,COMMA kilogram or a couple-of-kilogram animal could make such a transition .PERIOD 
It is really our greatest -DASH -DASH one of our greatest -DASH -DASH evolutionary sequences .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA my work began at the beginning .PERIOD 
I thought if I'm going to understand dinosaur evolution ,COMMA I'd have to go back to those beds where they had picked up fragments ,COMMA go back to a time and a place where the earliest dinosaurs existed .PERIOD 
I'd like to call for this little video clip to give you some idea of ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA what we face .PERIOD Normally ,COMMA we get asked a lot of questions :COLON Well ,COMMA how do you find fossils in areas that look like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds ,COMMA and they're located in Northeastern Argentina .PERIOD 
And we're coming over a cliff ,COMMA and at the top of that cliff ,COMMA dinosaurs had basically taken over .PERIOD 
At the bottom of the cliff ,COMMA we find that they're rare as hens' teeth .PERIOD 
That's where dinosaur origins is to be found :COLON at the bottom of the cliff .PERIOD 
You go into an area like this ,COMMA you get a geologic map ,COMMA you get a topographic map ,COMMA and the best ,COMMA most-inspired team you can bring to the area .PERIOD 
And the rest is up to you .PERIOD You've got to find fossils .PERIOD 
You've got to dig a hole that's usually quite a bit bigger than that to get it out ;SEMICOLON you've got to climb those cliffs and find ,COMMA really ,COMMA everything that existed -DASH -DASH not just the dinosaurs ,COMMA but the entire story .PERIOD If you're lucky ,COMMA and you dig a place like that ,COMMA you actually find the ash bed to dig it ,COMMA and we did .PERIOD 
<NUM> million years old ,COMMA we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur :COLON that's the Ur-dinosaur .PERIOD 
A three-and-a-half foot thing ,COMMA beautiful skull ,COMMA predator ,COMMA meat-eater ,COMMA a two-legged animal .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all the other dinosaurs that you know ,COMMA or your kids know ,COMMA at least ,COMMA on four legs .PERIOD 
This is sort of a look at the skull ,COMMA and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long .PERIOD 
It looks rather bird-like because it is .PERIOD 
It's bird-like and hollow .PERIOD 
A predator .PERIOD Maybe <NUM> pounds ,COMMA or <NUM> kilograms .PERIOD 
That's where dinosaurs began .PERIOD That's where the radiation began .PERIOD 
That is <NUM> times larger than the mammal radiation ,COMMA which was a four-legged radiation .PERIOD 
We are extremely dinosaur-like ,COMMA and unusual in our two-legged approach to life .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you want to understand what happened then when the continents broke apart ,COMMA and dinosaurs found -DASH -DASH landlubbers ,COMMA as they are -DASH -DASH found themselves adrift .PERIOD There's some missing puzzle pieces .PERIOD 
Most of those missing puzzle pieces are southern continents ,COMMA because it was those continents that are least explored .PERIOD 
If you want to add to this picture and try and sketch it globally ,COMMA you really have to force yourself to go down to the four corners of the Earth -DASH -DASH Africa ,COMMA India ,COMMA Antarctica ,COMMA Australia -DASH -DASH and start putting together some of these pieces .PERIOD 
I've been to some of those continents ,COMMA but Africa was ,COMMA in the words of Steven Pinker ,COMMA was a blank slate ,COMMA largely .PERIOD 
There's no roads into the Sahara .PERIOD It's an enormous place .PERIOD 
To be able to excavate the <NUM> tons of dinosaurs that we have in the Sahara and take them out ,COMMA you really have to put together an expedition team that can handle the conditions .PERIOD 
Some of them are political .PERIOD Many of them are physical .PERIOD 
Some of them -DASH -DASH the most important -DASH -DASH are mental .PERIOD 
And you really have to be able to withstand conditions -DASH -DASH you have to drive into the desert ,COMMA you will see landscapes in many cases -DASH -DASH you can see from what we've discovered -DASH -DASH that nobody else has ever seen .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA they're composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose .PERIOD 
They're usually students who've never seen a desert .PERIOD 
Some of them are more experienced .PERIOD 
Your job as a leader -DASH -DASH this is definitely a team sport -DASH -DASH your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they've ever done in their life under conditions that they can't imagine .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> degrees is normal .PERIOD 
The ground surface at <NUM> -DASH -DASH typical .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can't leave your normal metal tools out because you'll get a first-degree burn if you grab them sometimes .PERIOD 
These are the Tuareg nomads ,COMMA and they're living their lives much as they have for centuries .PERIOD 
Your job is to excavate things like this in the foreground ,COMMA and make them enter the pages of history .PERIOD 
To do that ,COMMA you've got to actually transport them thousands of miles out of the desert .PERIOD 
We're talking about Ethiopia ,COMMA but let's talk about Niger -DASH -DASH or Niger ,COMMA in our English language -DASH -DASH north of Nigeria -DASH -DASH that's where this photograph was taken .PERIOD 
Basically you're talking about a country that ,COMMA when we started working there ,COMMA did not have container traffic .PERIOD 
You transported the bones out yourself to the coast of Africa ,COMMA onto a boat ,COMMA if you wanted to get them out of the middle of the Sahara .PERIOD 
That's a <NUM> mile journey .PERIOD 
So enormous excavations and a lot of work ,COMMA and out of essentially a partial herd of dinosaurs that you saw buried there -DASH -DASH <NUM> tons of material -DASH -DASH we erect Jobaria ,COMMA a sauropod dinosaur like we haven't seen on some other continents .PERIOD 
It really is a little bit out of place temporally .PERIOD 
It looks nothing like what we would find if we dug in contemporary beds in North America .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA on and on -DASH -DASH a whole menagerie .PERIOD When you pick up something like this -DASH -DASH and some of you have had the chance to touch it -DASH -DASH this is a piece of history .PERIOD You're touching something that's <NUM> million years old .PERIOD 
This is a thumb claw .PERIOD There it was ,COMMA moments after it was discovered .PERIOD 
It's only been with us for less than a century ,COMMA and in that time ,COMMA that fourth dimension ,COMMA when radioactive dating came about ,COMMA less than a century ago ,COMMA and we could actually tell how old some of these things were ,COMMA is probably the most profound transformation ,COMMA because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically .PERIOD 
When you pick up a piece of history like that ,COMMA I think it can transform kids that are possibly interested in science .PERIOD 
That's the animal that thumb claw came from :COLON Suchomimus .PERIOD 
Here's some others .PERIOD 
This is something we found in Morocco ,COMMA an immense animal .PERIOD 
It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human .PERIOD 
This was the cover of Science ,COMMA because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals ,COMMA but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same .PERIOD Anyway ,COMMA smaller raptors .PERIOD 
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of -DASH -DASH all those small animals -DASH -DASH they all come from northern continents .PERIOD 
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent ,COMMA and guess what ?QUESTIONMARK You start preparing it .PERIOD 
It has no big claw on its hind foot .PERIOD It doesn't look like a Velociraptor .PERIOD 
It's really a wholly separate radiation .PERIOD 
So what we're trying to piece together here is a story .PERIOD 
It involves flying reptiles like this Pterosaur that we reconstructed from Africa .PERIOD 
Crocodiles ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and that's a nasty one we haven't named yet .PERIOD 
And huge things -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA this is a lower jaw just laying there in the desert of this enormous crocodile .PERIOD 
The crocodile is technically called Sarcosuchus .PERIOD 
That's an adult Orinoco crocodile in its jaws .PERIOD 
We had to try and reconstruct this .PERIOD 
We had to actually look at recent crocodiles to understand how crocodiles scale .PERIOD 
Could I have the second little video clip ?QUESTIONMARK 
We had to find and measure the largest crocodiles living today .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON .. .PERIOD as long as their boat .PERIOD 
Man :COLON Look at that set of choppers !EXCLAMATIONMARK Yeah ,COMMA he's a big one .PERIOD 
Man :COLON OK ,COMMA hand me some more here .PERIOD Man <NUM> :COLON OK .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON It falls to Paul to cover its eyes .PERIOD 
Man :COLON Watch out !EXCLAMATIONMARK Watch out !EXCLAMATIONMARK No ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD You're going to have to get on the back legs .PERIOD 
Man :COLON I got the back legs .PERIOD 
Man <NUM> :COLON You have the back legs ?QUESTIONMARK No ,COMMA you have the front legs ,COMMA my friend .PERIOD 
Somebody get the front legs .PERIOD 
Sixty-five .PERIOD Wow .PERIOD 
That's a big skull .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON Big ,COMMA but less than half the size of supercroc's skull .PERIOD 
Man :COLON Enormous .PERIOD PS :COLON You've got a .. .PERIOD 14-foot croc .PERIOD 
Man :COLON I knew it was big .PERIOD 
Don't get off .PERIOD You don't get off ,COMMA but don't worry about me .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON Paul has his data ,COMMA so they decide to release the animal back into the river .PERIOD 
Don't get off !EXCLAMATIONMARK Don't get off !EXCLAMATIONMARK Don't get off !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Narrator :COLON Paul has never seen a fossil do that .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA when I say three ,COMMA we move .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Whoa !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So -DASH -DASH there were -DASH -DASH Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the -DASH -DASH the fossil record is truly amazing because it really forces you to look at living animals in a new way .PERIOD 
We proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .PERIOD 
It depended on the shape of their skull ,COMMA though ,COMMA so we had to actually get those measurements to be sure that we had reconstructed and could prove to the scientific world that supercroc in fact is a 40-foot crocodile ,COMMA probably a male .PERIOD 
I'm going to lead an expedition to the Sahara to dig up Africa's largest neolithic site .PERIOD 
We found this last year .PERIOD 
Two hundred skeletons ,COMMA tools ,COMMA jewelry .PERIOD 
This is a ceremonial disk .PERIOD 
An amazing record of the colonization of the Sahara <NUM> years ago is been sitting out there waiting for us to go back .PERIOD So ,COMMA really exciting .PERIOD 
And then work later is going to take us to Tibet .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we normally think of Tibet as a highland .PERIOD 
It's really an island continent .PERIOD 
It was a precursor to India ,COMMA a messenger from Gondwana -DASH -DASH a lost paradise of dinosaurs isolated for millions of years .PERIOD 
No one's found them .PERIOD We know where they are ,COMMA and we're going to go and get them next year .PERIOD 
They're only between <NUM> and <NUM> feet ,COMMA but if you go in the warm part of the year ,COMMA it's O.K .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I tried to suture together a dinosaur evolutionary history so that we can try to understand some basic patterns of evolution .PERIOD 
I've talked about a few of them .PERIOD We really need to take that further .PERIOD 
We need to delve into this mass of anatomy that we've been compiling to understand where the changes are occurring and what this means .PERIOD 
We can't predict ,COMMA necessarily ,COMMA what will happen in evolution ,COMMA but we can learn some of the rules of the game ,COMMA and that's really what we're trying to do .PERIOD 
With regard to the biogeographic question ,COMMA the Earth is dividing .PERIOD 
You get divided ,COMMA and a continent's division corresponds to a fork in the evolutionary tree ,COMMA or you're crafty ,COMMA and you manage to escape from one to the other and erase that division ,COMMA or you're living peacefully on each side ,COMMA and on one side you just go extinct ,COMMA and you survive on the other side and create a difference .PERIOD 
And the fourth thing is that you actually did one or the other of those three things ,COMMA but the paleontologist never found you .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA in addition to digging ,COMMA I think we have some answers from the dinosaur record .PERIOD I think these dinosaurs migrated -DASH -DASH we call it dispersal -DASH -DASH around the globe ,COMMA with the slightest land bridge .PERIOD 
But when they were divided ,COMMA indeed they were divided ,COMMA and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs .PERIOD 
But there's one thing that's even more important ,COMMA and I think that's extinction .PERIOD 
We have downgraded this factor .PERIOD 
It carves up the history of life ,COMMA and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end ,COMMA right before the bolide impact .PERIOD 
The best way to test this is to actually create a model .PERIOD 
So if we move back ,COMMA this is a two-dimensional typical tree of life .PERIOD 
I want to give you three dimensions .PERIOD 
So you see the tree of life ,COMMA but now I've added the dimension of area .PERIOD 
So the tree of life is normally divergence over time .PERIOD 
This is a computer program which has three knobs .PERIOD 
We can control those things that we're worried about :COLON extinction ,COMMA sampling ,COMMA dispersal -DASH -DASH going from one area to another .PERIOD 
And ultimately we can control the branching to mimic what we think the continents were like ,COMMA and run it a thousand times ,COMMA so we can estimate the parameters ,COMMA to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not ,COMMA at least to know the barriers of the problems .PERIOD So that's a little bit about the science .PERIOD 
Today I'm going to spend the rest of my few minutes up here talking about the other stuff that I do in Chicago ,COMMA which is related to the fact that I never -DASH -DASH and actually ,COMMA in talking to a lot of TEDsters ,COMMA there's a number of you out there -DASH -DASH I don't know that I'd get an answer honestly ,COMMA if I asked you to raise your hand ,COMMA but there are a number of you out there that started your scientific ,COMMA technical ,COMMA entertainment career as failures ,COMMA by society's standards ,COMMA as failures by schools .PERIOD 
I was one of those .PERIOD I was failed by my school -DASH -DASH my school failed me .PERIOD 
Who's pointing fingers ?QUESTIONMARK 
Several teachers nearly killed me .PERIOD 
I found myself in art .PERIOD 
And I went on -DASH -DASH that's my first painting on canvas .PERIOD 
I read a dictionary .PERIOD I got into college .PERIOD 
I became an artist .PERIOD O.K. ,COMMA and started drawing .PERIOD 
It became abstract .PERIOD 
I worked up a portfolio ,COMMA and I was headed to New York .PERIOD 
Sometimes I would see bones when there was a body there .PERIOD 
Something was going on in the background .PERIOD I headed to New York to a studio .PERIOD 
I took a side trip to the American Museum ,COMMA and I never recovered .PERIOD 
But really it's the same discipline -DASH -DASH they're kindred disciplines .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA is there anything that is not visualizing what can't be seen ,COMMA in terms of discovering this dinosaur bone from a small piece of it that's out there ,COMMA or seeing the distortion that we try to see as evolutionary distortion in one animal to another ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a very extraordinarily visual .PERIOD 
I give you a human face because you're experts at that .PERIOD 
It takes us years to understand how to do that with dinosaurs .PERIOD 
They're really kindred disciplines .PERIOD 
But what we're trying to create in Chicago is a way to get ,COMMA collect together ,COMMA those students who are least represented in our science and technology spheres .PERIOD 
We all know ,COMMA and there's been several allusions to it ,COMMA that we are failing in our ability to produce enough scientists ,COMMA engineers and technicians .PERIOD 
We've known that for a long time .PERIOD We've gone through the Sputnik phase ,COMMA and now ,COMMA as you see the increase in the pace of what we're doing ,COMMA it becomes even more prominent .PERIOD Where are all these people going to come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
And a more general question for our society is ,COMMA what's going to happen to all the rest that are left behind ?QUESTIONMARK 
Those are the questions I ask .PERIOD And we talk about Ethiopia ,COMMA and it's very important .PERIOD 
Niger is equally important ,COMMA and I'm trying desperately to do something in Niger .PERIOD 
They have an AIDS problem .PERIOD I asked -DASH -DASH the U.S .PERIOD State Department asked the government recently ,COMMA What do you want to do ?QUESTIONMARK And they gave them two problems .PERIOD 
Dinosaurs was one of them .PERIOD 
Give us a museum of dinosaurs ,COMMA and we will attract tourists ,COMMA which is our number two industry .PERIOD 
And I hope to God the United States government ,COMMA me ,COMMA or TED ,COMMA or somebody helps us do that ,COMMA because that would be an incredible thing for their country .PERIOD 
But when we look back at our own country ,COMMA we're looking back at our cities ,COMMA the cities where most of you come from -DASH -DASH certainly the city I come from -DASH -DASH there's legions of kids out there like these .PERIOD 
And the question is -DASH -DASH and we started to address this question for centuries -DASH -DASH as to how we get these kids involved in science .PERIOD 
We've started in Chicago an organization -DASH -DASH a non-profit organization -DASH -DASH called Project Exploration .PERIOD 
These are two kids from Project Exploration .PERIOD 
We met them in their early stages in high school .PERIOD They were -DASH -DASH failing to poor students ,COMMA and they are now -DASH -DASH one at the University of Chicago ,COMMA another in Illinois .PERIOD 
We've got students at Harvard .PERIOD We're six years old .PERIOD 
And we created a track record .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've created an incredible track record of <NUM> percent graduation ,COMMA <NUM> percent going to college ,COMMA many first-generation ,COMMA <NUM> percent of those choosing science as a career .PERIOD 
It's an impressive track record ,COMMA and so we look back and we say ,COMMA well ,COMMA we didn't really exactly work this out theoretically from the start ,COMMA but when we look back ,COMMA there are theoretical movements in science education .PERIOD 
It's gone through science as an inquiry ,COMMA which was a big advance ,COMMA and Dewey back at Chicago -DASH -DASH you learn by doing .PERIOD 
To -DASH -DASH you learn by envisioning yourself as a scientist ,COMMA and then you learn to envision yourself as a scientist .PERIOD 
The next step is to learn the capability to make yourself a scientist .PERIOD 
You have to have those steps .PERIOD If you have -DASH -DASH It's easy to get kids interested in science .PERIOD 
It's hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist ,COMMA which involves standing up in front of people like we're doing here at this symposium and presenting something as a knowledgeable person ,COMMA and then seeing yourself in the role as a scientist and giving yourself the tools to pursue that .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA that's what we're going to do .PERIOD We're planning a permanent home in Chicago .PERIOD 
We have lots of ideas ,COMMA but I guarantee you this one thing -DASH -DASH and I've talked to some people here at TED -DASH -DASH it's not going to look like anything you've seen before .PERIOD 
It's going to be part-school ,COMMA part-museum hall ,COMMA part-conservatory ,COMMA part-zoo ,COMMA and part of an answer to the problem of how you interest kids in science .PERIOD 
Ever since I was a little girl seeing Star Wars for the first time ,COMMA I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots .PERIOD 
I knew robots like that didn't really exist ,COMMA but I knew I wanted to build them .PERIOD 
So <NUM> years pass -DASH -DASH I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence ,COMMA the year is <NUM> ,COMMA and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars .PERIOD 
But robots are still not in our home ,COMMA ironically .PERIOD 
And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case .PERIOD 
But one really struck me .PERIOD 
Robotics had really been about interacting with things ,COMMA not with people -DASH -DASH certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA that was the white space ;SEMICOLON that's what robots could not do yet .PERIOD 
And so that year ,COMMA I started to build this robot ,COMMA Kismet ,COMMA the world's first social robot .PERIOD 
Three years later -DASH -DASH a lot of programming ,COMMA working with other graduate students in the lab -DASH -DASH Kismet was ready to start interacting with people .PERIOD 
Scientist :COLON I want to show you something .PERIOD 
Kismet :COLON Scientist :COLON This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me .PERIOD 
Kismet :COLON Scientist :COLON Yeah ,COMMA look ,COMMA it's got a little blue light in it too .PERIOD 
Cynthia Breazeal :COLON So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child ,COMMA which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind .PERIOD 
It didn't speak language ,COMMA but it didn't matter .PERIOD 
This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -DASH -DASH and with that ,COMMA the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots .PERIOD 
So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots ,COMMA now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students .PERIOD 
And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo .PERIOD 
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio .PERIOD 
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo .PERIOD 
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo ,COMMA introducing Leo to a new object .PERIOD 
And because it's new ,COMMA Leo doesn't really know what to make of it .PERIOD 
But sort of like us ,COMMA he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction .PERIOD 
Matt Berlin :COLON Hello ,COMMA Leo .PERIOD 
Can you find Cookie Monster ?QUESTIONMARK 
Leo ,COMMA Cookie Monster is very bad .PERIOD 
He's very bad ,COMMA Leo .PERIOD 
Cookie Monster is very ,COMMA very bad .PERIOD 
He's a scary monster .PERIOD 
He wants to get your cookies .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start ,COMMA but they get along great now .PERIOD 
So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology ,COMMA where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality .PERIOD 
And with that shift in thinking ,COMMA we can now start to imagine new questions ,COMMA new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise .PERIOD 
But what do I mean when I say push our social buttons ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA one of the things that we've learned is that ,COMMA if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language ,COMMA the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use -DASH -DASH like Nexi ,COMMA our humanoid robot ,COMMA is doing here -DASH -DASH what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people .PERIOD 
People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is ,COMMA how likable ,COMMA how engaging ,COMMA how trustworthy .PERIOD 
It turns out it's the same for robots .PERIOD 
It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior .PERIOD 
To answer questions like ,COMMA how is it that ,COMMA from a brief encounter ,COMMA we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mimicry's believed to play a role ,COMMA but how ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters ?QUESTIONMARK 
It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically .PERIOD 
We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us .PERIOD 
But with the robot ,COMMA you can .PERIOD 
And so in this video here -DASH -DASH this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University .PERIOD 
He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with .PERIOD 
There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question .PERIOD 
And the bottom line is -DASH -DASH the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot .PERIOD 
So given that key insight ,COMMA we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues ,COMMA maybe they would be a cool ,COMMA new communication technology .PERIOD 
So imagine this :COLON What about a robot accessory for your cellphone ?QUESTIONMARK 
You call your friend ,COMMA she puts her handset in a robot ,COMMA and ,COMMA bam !EXCLAMATIONMARK You're a MeBot -DASH -DASH you can make eye contact ,COMMA you can talk with your friends ,COMMA you can move around ,COMMA you can gesture -DASH -DASH maybe the next best thing to really being there ,COMMA or is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
To explore this question ,COMMA my student ,COMMA Siggy Adalgeirsson ,COMMA did a study where we brought human participants ,COMMA people ,COMMA into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator .PERIOD 
The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table ,COMMA discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task -DASH -DASH this ended up being a survival task -DASH -DASH and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were .PERIOD 
The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants .PERIOD 
The first was just the screen .PERIOD 
This is just like video conferencing today .PERIOD 
The next was to add mobility -DASH -DASH so ,COMMA have the screen on a mobile base .PERIOD 
This is like ,COMMA if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today -DASH -DASH this is mirroring that situation .PERIOD 
And then the fully expressive MeBot .PERIOD 
So after the interaction ,COMMA we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology ,COMMA with a remote collaborator through this technology ,COMMA in a number of different ways .PERIOD 
We looked at overall engagement .PERIOD 
And this is what we see when they use just the screen .PERIOD 
It turns out ,COMMA when you add mobility -DASH -DASH the ability to roll around the table -DASH -DASH you get a little more of a boost .PERIOD 
And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression .PERIOD 
So it seems like this physical ,COMMA social embodiment actually really makes a difference .PERIOD 
Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA I have three young boys ,COMMA and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents .PERIOD 
But my parents live thousands of miles away ,COMMA so they just don't get to see each other that often .PERIOD 
We try Skype ,COMMA we try phone calls ,COMMA but my boys are little -DASH -DASH they don't really want to talk ;SEMICOLON they want to play .PERIOD 
So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance-play technology .PERIOD 
I imagine a time not too far from now -DASH -DASH my mom can go to her computer ,COMMA open up a browser and jack into a little robot .PERIOD 
I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters ,COMMA with their friends ,COMMA and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house ,COMMA like sharing a bedtime story .PERIOD 
And through this technology ,COMMA being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today .PERIOD 
Let's think about some other domains ,COMMA like maybe health .PERIOD 
So in the United States today ,COMMA over <NUM> percent of people are either overweight or obese ,COMMA and now it's a big problem with our children as well .PERIOD 
And we know that as you get older in life ,COMMA if you're obese when you're younger ,COMMA that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life ,COMMA but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system .PERIOD 
But if robots can be engaging ,COMMA if we like to cooperate with robots ,COMMA if robots are persuasive ,COMMA maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program ,COMMA maybe they can help you manage your weight .PERIOD 
Sort of like a digital Jiminy -DASH -DASH as in the well-known fairy tale -DASH -DASH a kind of friendly ,COMMA supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits .PERIOD 
So we actually explored this idea in our lab .PERIOD 
This is a robot ,COMMA Autom .PERIOD 
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work .PERIOD 
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach .PERIOD 
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do .PERIOD 
It could make eye contact with you .PERIOD 
It could share information looking down at a screen .PERIOD 
You'd use a screen interface to enter information ,COMMA like how many calories you ate that day ,COMMA how much exercise you got .PERIOD 
And then it could help track that for you .PERIOD 
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth .PERIOD 
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue .PERIOD 
It could help you set goals and track your progress ,COMMA and it would help motivate you .PERIOD 
So an interesting question is ,COMMA does the social embodiment really matter ?QUESTIONMARK Does it matter that it's a robot ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters ?QUESTIONMARK 
To explore that question ,COMMA we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks .PERIOD 
One case was the robot you saw there ,COMMA Autom .PERIOD 
And the third was just a pen and paper log ,COMMA because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet-and-exercise program .PERIOD 
So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost ,COMMA but really how long they interacted with the robot .PERIOD 
Because the challenge is not losing weight ,COMMA it's actually keeping it off .PERIOD 
And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions ,COMMA well that's indicative ,COMMA potentially ,COMMA of longer-term success .PERIOD 
So the first thing I want to look at is how long ,COMMA how long did people interact with these systems .PERIOD 
It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more ,COMMA even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer .PERIOD 
When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance ,COMMA people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more .PERIOD 
And when you look at emotional engagement ,COMMA it was completely different .PERIOD 
People would name the robots .PERIOD 
They would dress the robots .PERIOD 
And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study ,COMMA they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots .PERIOD 
They didn't do this with a computer .PERIOD 
The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media .PERIOD 
We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today ,COMMA whether it's television or computer games or whatnot .PERIOD 
My sons ,COMMA they love the screen .PERIOD They love the screen .PERIOD 
But I want them to play ;SEMICOLON as a mom ,COMMA I want them to play ,COMMA like ,COMMA real-world play .PERIOD 
And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child ,COMMA where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play .PERIOD 
So here's the first exploration of this idea ,COMMA where characters can be physical or virtual ,COMMA and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back .PERIOD 
I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended-reality play .PERIOD 
But we can push this idea further .PERIOD 
What if -DASH -DASH Nathan :COLON Here it comes .PERIOD Yay !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
 -DASH -DASH the character itself could come into your world ?QUESTIONMARK 
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world .PERIOD 
And when it's in their world ,COMMA they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .PERIOD 
Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities .PERIOD 
So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world .PERIOD 
So here ,COMMA Nathan has changed the letter A to the number <NUM> .PERIOD 
You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world .PERIOD 
So they are now sending the character back into that world .PERIOD 
And now it's got number power .PERIOD 
And then finally ,COMMA what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids ,COMMA where they really feel like they are part of that story ,COMMA a part of that experience .PERIOD 
And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching Star Wars .PERIOD 
But I want to do more than that .PERIOD 
I actually want them to create those experiences .PERIOD 
I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own .PERIOD 
So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them .PERIOD 
I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation .PERIOD 
I think that's very ,COMMA very important .PERIOD 
So this is a new project .PERIOD 
But I can tell you ,COMMA the thing that they love the most is the robot .PERIOD 
What they care about is the robot .PERIOD 
Robots touch something deeply human within us .PERIOD 
And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative ,COMMA or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance ,COMMA or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves ,COMMA for me ,COMMA robots are all about people .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Running -DASH -DASH it's basically just right ,COMMA left ,COMMA right ,COMMA left -DASH -DASH yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA we've been doing it for two million years ,COMMA so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago .PERIOD 
But the cool thing about running ,COMMA as I've discovered ,COMMA is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time .PERIOD 
Case in point :COLON A couple months ago ,COMMA if you saw the New York City Marathon ,COMMA I guarantee you ,COMMA you saw something that no one has ever seen before .PERIOD 
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line .PERIOD 
She's <NUM> years old ,COMMA she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years ,COMMA and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth .PERIOD 
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport ,COMMA but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event ,COMMA the New York City Marathon .PERIOD 
Except -DASH -DASH bad news for Derartu Tulu -DASH -DASH some other people had the same idea ,COMMA including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe ,COMMA who is a monster ,COMMA the fastest woman marathoner in history by far .PERIOD 
Only <NUM> minutes off the men's world record ,COMMA Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable .PERIOD 
The gun goes off ,COMMA and she's not even an underdog .PERIOD 
She's under the underdogs .PERIOD 
But the under-underdog hangs tough ,COMMA and <NUM> miles into a 26-mile race ,COMMA there is Derartu Tulu up there with the lead pack .PERIOD 
Now this is when something really bizarre happens .PERIOD 
So we all know what to do in this situation ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line .PERIOD 
Derartu Tulu ruins the script .PERIOD 
Instead of taking off ,COMMA she falls back ,COMMA and she grabs Paula Radcliffe ,COMMA says ,COMMA Come on .PERIOD Come with us .PERIOD You can do it .PERIOD 
So Paula Radcliffe ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA does it .PERIOD 
She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line .PERIOD 
But then she falls back again .PERIOD 
And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her .PERIOD 
And Paula Radcliffe at that point says ,COMMA I'm done .PERIOD Go .PERIOD 
So that's a fantastic story ,COMMA and we all know how it ends .PERIOD 
She loses the check ,COMMA but she goes home with something bigger and more important .PERIOD 
Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again -DASH -DASH instead of losing ,COMMA she blazes past the lead pack and wins ,COMMA wins the New York City Marathon ,COMMA goes home with a big fat check .PERIOD 
It's a heartwarming story ,COMMA but if you drill a little bit deeper ,COMMA you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there .PERIOD 
When you have two outliers in one organism ,COMMA it's not a coincidence .PERIOD 
When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race ,COMMA again ,COMMA it's not a coincidence .PERIOD 
You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills ;SEMICOLON somehow water's involved .PERIOD 
Someone with that kind of heart ,COMMA there's some kind of connection there .PERIOD 
And the answer to it ,COMMA I think ,COMMA can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico ,COMMA where there's a tribe ,COMMA a reclusive tribe ,COMMA called the Tarahumara Indians .PERIOD 
Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things .PERIOD 
Number one is ,COMMA they have been living essentially unchanged for the past <NUM> years .PERIOD 
When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices :COLON you either fight back and engage or you could take off .PERIOD 
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged ,COMMA which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs .PERIOD 
The Tarahumara had a different strategy .PERIOD 
They took off and hid in this labyrinthine ,COMMA networking ,COMMA spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons ,COMMA and there they remained since the 1600s -DASH -DASH essentially the same way they've always been .PERIOD 
The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is ,COMMA deep into old age -DASH -DASH <NUM> to <NUM> years old -DASH -DASH these guys aren't running marathons ;SEMICOLON they're running mega-marathons .PERIOD 
The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today ,COMMA all the things that we're trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve -DASH -DASH things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression -DASH -DASH all this stuff ,COMMA the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about .PERIOD 
They are free from all of these modern ailments .PERIOD 
So what's the connection ?QUESTIONMARK 
Again ,COMMA we're talking about outliers -DASH -DASH there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever .PERIOD 
They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries .PERIOD 
And once again ,COMMA a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery -DASH -DASH perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries ,COMMA which go like this :COLON three things -DASH -DASH if you have the answer ,COMMA come up and take the microphone ,COMMA because nobody else knows the answer .PERIOD 
Mystery number one is this :COLON Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size .PERIOD 
Suddenly humans show up -DASH -DASH Homo erectus -DASH -DASH big ,COMMA old melon-head .PERIOD 
To have a brain of that size ,COMMA you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA early humans are eating dead animals -DASH -DASH no argument ,COMMA that's a fact .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA for nearly two million years ,COMMA we are killing animals without any weapons .PERIOD 
Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle .PERIOD 
Every other animal is stronger than we are -DASH -DASH they have fangs ,COMMA they have claws ,COMMA they have nimbleness ,COMMA they have speed .PERIOD 
We think Usain Bolt is fast .PERIOD Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel .PERIOD 
That would be an Olympic event :COLON turn a squirrel loose -DASH -DASH whoever catches the squirrel ,COMMA you get a gold medal .PERIOD 
So no weapons ,COMMA no speed ,COMMA no strength ,COMMA no fangs ,COMMA no claws -DASH -DASH how were we killing these animals ?QUESTIONMARK Mystery number one .PERIOD 
Mystery number two :COLON Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now ,COMMA but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters -DASH -DASH they all suck ;SEMICOLON they're terrible .PERIOD 
There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .PERIOD 
The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in <NUM> :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than <NUM> :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
For some reason you guys are just really slow .PERIOD 
But you get to the marathon we were just talking about -DASH -DASH you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA prior to the 1980s ,COMMA medical science said that if a woman tried to run <NUM> miles -DASH -DASH does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run <NUM> miles ,COMMA why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes .PERIOD You would have torn reproductive organs .PERIOD 
The uterus would fall out ,COMMA literally fall out of the body .PERIOD 
Now I've been to a lot of marathons ,COMMA and I've yet to see any .. .PERIOD 
So it's only been <NUM> years that women have been allowed to run the marathon .PERIOD 
In that very short learning curve ,COMMA you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only <NUM> minutes off the male world record .PERIOD 
You can take a runner like Ann Trason ,COMMA or Nikki Kimball ,COMMA or Jenn Shelton ,COMMA you put them in a race of <NUM> or <NUM> miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win .PERIOD 
I'll give you an example .PERIOD 
A couple years ago ,COMMA Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock <NUM> ,COMMA which tells you all you need to know about the race .PERIOD 
They give you <NUM> hours to finish this race .PERIOD 
So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer ?QUESTIONMARK 
The third mystery is this :COLON At the University of Utah ,COMMA they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon .PERIOD 
And what they found is that ,COMMA if you start running the marathon at age <NUM> ,COMMA you will get progressively faster ,COMMA year by year ,COMMA until you reach your peak at age <NUM> .PERIOD 
And then after that ,COMMA you succumb to the rigors of time .PERIOD 
So about seven years ,COMMA eight years to reach your peak ,COMMA and then gradually you fall off your peak ,COMMA until you go back to the starting point .PERIOD 
You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed ,COMMA maybe <NUM> years -DASH -DASH no ,COMMA it's <NUM> years .PERIOD 
64-year-old men and women are running as fast as they were at age <NUM> .PERIOD 
So you have these three mysteries .PERIOD 
Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up ?QUESTIONMARK 
You've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer ,COMMA because ,COMMA it being prehistory ,COMMA you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it .PERIOD 
But I'll submit this to you :COLON If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle ,COMMA suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture .PERIOD 
If you wonder ,COMMA why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease ,COMMA why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive ,COMMA and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons ,COMMA perhaps it's because humans ,COMMA as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe ,COMMA actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs .PERIOD 
Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness -DASH -DASH again ,COMMA it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed -DASH -DASH the only thing we do really ,COMMA really well is sweat .PERIOD 
We're really good at being sweaty and smelly .PERIOD 
Better than any other mammal on Earth ,COMMA we can sweat really well .PERIOD 
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that ,COMMA when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances ,COMMA we're superb ,COMMA we're the best on the planet .PERIOD 
You take a horse on a hot day ,COMMA and after about five or six miles ,COMMA that horse has a choice .PERIOD 
It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off ,COMMA but it ain't doing both -DASH -DASH we can .PERIOD 
So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals ?QUESTIONMARK 
What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group ,COMMA go out there on that African Savannah ,COMMA pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's all we could do .PERIOD 
We could run really far on a hot day .PERIOD 
If you go out by yourself ,COMMA and you try to chase an antelope ,COMMA I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah .PERIOD 
You need a pack to pull together .PERIOD 
You need to have those 64- ,COMMA 65-year-olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch .PERIOD 
The herd explodes and it gathers back again .PERIOD 
Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack .PERIOD 
They can't be <NUM> miles behind .PERIOD 
You need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent .PERIOD 
It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it <NUM> miles away .PERIOD 
They need to be part of the pack .PERIOD 
The pack stays together .PERIOD 
Another thing that has to be true about this pack :COLON this pack cannot be really materialistic .PERIOD 
You can't be a pissed-off pack .PERIOD You can't be bearing grudges ,COMMA like ,COMMA I'm not chasing that guy's antelope .PERIOD 
The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego ,COMMA be cooperative and pull together .PERIOD 
What you end up with ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara -DASH -DASH a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age .PERIOD 
It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years ,COMMA that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we look at running as this kind of alien ,COMMA foreign thing ,COMMA this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before .PERIOD 
But maybe it's something different .PERIOD 
Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it .PERIOD 
How do we spoil it ?QUESTIONMARK Well how do we spoil anything ?QUESTIONMARK 
We try to cash in on it .PERIOD 
We try to can it and package it and make it better and sell it to people .PERIOD 
And what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things ,COMMA which can make running better ,COMMA called running shoes .PERIOD 
The reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt .PERIOD 
And I think that ,COMMA if anybody in here runs -DASH -DASH and I just had a conversation with Carol ;SEMICOLON we talked for two minutes backstage ,COMMA and she's talking about plantar fasciitis .PERIOD 
You talk to a runner ,COMMA I guarantee ,COMMA within <NUM> seconds ,COMMA the conversation turns to injury .PERIOD 
So if humans evolved as runners ,COMMA if that's our one natural advantage ,COMMA why are we so bad at it ?QUESTIONMARK Why do we keep getting hurt ?QUESTIONMARK 
Curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time .PERIOD 
If you read folklore and mythology ,COMMA any kind of myths ,COMMA any kind of tall tales ,COMMA running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor .PERIOD 
It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain .PERIOD 
Geronimo was never saying ,COMMA Ah ,COMMA you know something ,COMMA my achilles -DASH -DASH I'm tapering .PERIOD I got to take this week off ,COMMA or I need to cross-train .PERIOD 
Humans ran and ran all the time .PERIOD 
We are here today .PERIOD We have our digital technology .PERIOD 
All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day ,COMMA which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances .PERIOD 
So how do we get back to that again ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging ,COMMA all the sales ,COMMA all the marketing .PERIOD 
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes .PERIOD 
Stop focusing on urban marathons ,COMMA which ,COMMA if you do four hours ,COMMA you suck .PERIOD 
If you do <NUM> :COLON <NUM> :COLON <NUM> ,COMMA you're awesome ,COMMA because you qualified for another race .PERIOD 
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA nakedness ,COMMA that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time .PERIOD 
So what's the benefit ?QUESTIONMARK So what ?QUESTIONMARK 
So you burn off the Haagen-Dazs from the night before ?QUESTIONMARK 
But maybe there's another benefit there as well .PERIOD 
Without getting a little too extreme about this ,COMMA imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed ,COMMA more serene ,COMMA more healthy ,COMMA burn off stress -DASH -DASH where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore ,COMMA where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again .PERIOD 
Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been .PERIOD 
I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize ,COMMA which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet ,COMMA but maybe there's somewhere in between .PERIOD 
And if we find that thing ,COMMA maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there .PERIOD 
Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence ,COMMA up until the 1970s or so ,COMMA the benefits ,COMMA social and physical and political and mental ,COMMA could be astounding .PERIOD 
So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners ,COMMA people who got rid of their shoes .PERIOD 
And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes ,COMMA you get rid of the stress ,COMMA you get rid of the injuries and the ailments .PERIOD 
And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time ,COMMA that this can be a whole lot of fun .PERIOD 
I've experienced it personally myself .PERIOD 
I was injured all my life ,COMMA and then in my early 40s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too .PERIOD 
And I appreciate you guys listening to this story .PERIOD Thanks very much .PERIOD 
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums .PERIOD 
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture ,COMMA and the importance of the image :COLON celebrity is born of photography .PERIOD 
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago ,COMMA when Princess Diana died .PERIOD 
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death ,COMMA and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana ,COMMA but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche .PERIOD 
The press wrote about her death in rather ,COMMA I felt ,COMMA pornographic ways -DASH -DASH like ,COMMA Which bit of artery left which bit of body ?QUESTIONMARK 
and How did she die in the back of the car ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism ,COMMA so I made these rather gory images .PERIOD 
So people were wondering :COLON was she going to marry Dodi ?QUESTIONMARK 
Was she in love with him ?QUESTIONMARK 
Was she pregnant ?QUESTIONMARK Did she want his baby ?QUESTIONMARK 
Was she pregnant when she died ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I created this image of Diana ,COMMA Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out ,COMMA which caused a huge public outcry at the time .PERIOD 
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery ,COMMA so I started making reference to media imagery -DASH -DASH made it grainy ,COMMA shot through doorways and so on and so forth -DASH -DASH to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism .PERIOD 
And this gets shown in art galleries like this ,COMMA as a sequence .PERIOD 
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery -DASH -DASH this is another art gallery installation .PERIOD 
I'm particularly interested in how you can't rely on your own perception .PERIOD 
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA but you think it's Camilla and the Queen ,COMMA and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real .PERIOD 
And the camera can lie ,COMMA and it makes it very ,COMMA very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter .PERIOD 
And at the same time ,COMMA it removes us from the real subject matter ,COMMA and this acts as a sort of titillating thing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ;SEMICOLON what you can't have ,COMMA you want more .PERIOD 
In the photograph ,COMMA the real subject doesn't exist so it makes you want that person more .PERIOD 
And that is the way ,COMMA I think ,COMMA that celebrity magazines work now :COLON the more pictures you see of these celebrities ,COMMA the more you feel you know them ,COMMA but you don't know them and you want to know them further .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA the Queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses .. .PERIOD 
watch her horses .PERIOD .PERIOD 
And then I was sort of making imagery .PERIOD 
In England there's an expression :COLON you can't imagine the Queen on the loo .PERIOD 
So I'm trying to penetrate that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here is the image .PERIOD 
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle :COLON I was making comments about the press and about how we know facts and information only by media -DASH -DASH because we don't know the real people ;SEMICOLON very few of us know the real people -DASH -DASH but it was going back into the press and they were publicizing ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA my filthy work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these are broadsheets ,COMMA tabloids ,COMMA debates were being had all about this work ,COMMA films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work ,COMMA politicians were getting involved -DASH -DASH all sorts of things -DASH -DASH great headlines .PERIOD 
Then suddenly ,COMMA it started to get on front pages .PERIOD 
I was being asked and paid to do front covers .PERIOD 
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable ,COMMA which I found also fascinating .PERIOD 
How one moment -DASH -DASH it was disgusting -DASH -DASH journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me ,COMMA saying my work was wonderful ,COMMA and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me .PERIOD 
I then started to work for magazines and newspapers .PERIOD 
This was ,COMMA for example ,COMMA an image that went into Tatler .PERIOD 
This was another newspaper image .PERIOD 
It was an April fool actually ,COMMA and to this day some people think it's real .PERIOD 
They thought it was real .PERIOD 
I was exploring ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA the hyperbole of icons -DASH -DASH and Diana and Marilyn -DASH -DASH and the importance of celebrity in our lives .PERIOD 
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche without us even knowing ,COMMA and how that should happen .PERIOD 
There's me as Diana -DASH -DASH I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley ,COMMA I think ,COMMA in this one .PERIOD .PERIOD 
This is the look-alike ,COMMA so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous .PERIOD 
She looks nothing like Marilyn ,COMMA but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on ,COMMA she looks exactly like Marilyn ,COMMA to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her -DASH -DASH or recognize this look-alike -DASH -DASH in these photographs ,COMMA which I find quite interesting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all this work is getting shown in art galleries .PERIOD 
Then I made a book .PERIOD 
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time .PERIOD 
Stills from the TV series went into this book .PERIOD 
But there was a real legal problem because it looks real ,COMMA but how do you get over that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now :COLON that we can't tell what's real .PERIOD 
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA from my point of view ,COMMA it's important to publish it ,COMMA but at the same time it does cause a confusion -DASH -DASH intentional on my behalf ,COMMA but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with .PERIOD 
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do ,COMMA and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities and comments about our public figures .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru ?QUESTIONMARK 
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about Bin Laden ,COMMA Saddam Hussein ,COMMA the links that were put about pre-Iraq war .PERIOD 
And what is going to happen to the monarchy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because obviously the British public ,COMMA I think ,COMMA would prefer William to Charles on the throne .PERIOD 
And it's that wish ,COMMA or that desire ,COMMA that I suppose I'm dealing with in my work .PERIOD 
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves .PERIOD 
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity .PERIOD 
And with some look-alikes ,COMMA they are so good you don't know whether they're real or not .PERIOD 
It's highly commercial .PERIOD 
But it was a difficulty for me -DASH -DASH because this is my artwork ;SEMICOLON should I do advertising ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH at the time .PERIOD 
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same .PERIOD 
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on ,COMMA you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing .PERIOD 
When you take the logo off ,COMMA you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive ,COMMA opposed to conclusive when you are advertising .PERIOD 
This image is quite interesting ,COMMA actually ,COMMA because I think we made it three years ago .PERIOD 
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress ,COMMA which ,COMMA again ,COMMA nearly got re-used now ,COMMA recently prior to her wedding .PERIOD 
It's obviously a very big commercial company ,COMMA and so this little ,COMMA Shh -DASH -DASH it's not really them ,COMMA was put on the side of the imagery .PERIOD 
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail .PERIOD 
I then was asked by Selfridges to do a series of windows for them ,COMMA so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes -DASH -DASH live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows ,COMMA and the windows were all steamed up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech ;SEMICOLON I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin ;SEMICOLON Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson ,COMMA who he was having an affair with at that time .PERIOD 
This was a huge success for them because the imagery got shown in the press the day after in every single newspaper ,COMMA broadsheets and tabloids .PERIOD 
It was a bit of a road stopper ,COMMA which was problematic because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds ,COMMA but huge fun -DASH -DASH it was great for me to do a performance .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA people were taking photographs of this ,COMMA so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly ,COMMA all this imagery .PERIOD 
Further imagery .PERIOD I'm making a new book now with Taschen that I'm working on really for a sort of global market -DASH -DASH my previous book was only for the U.K .PERIOD market -DASH -DASH that I suppose it could be called humorous .PERIOD 
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background with serious intent ,COMMA and then suddenly my work is funny .PERIOD 
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous ,COMMA in a way ;SEMICOLON I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery .PERIOD 
It's an extremely fast way of getting information .PERIOD 
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly ,COMMA and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery .PERIOD 
This image ,COMMA for example ,COMMA is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private ,COMMA and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein ,COMMA and George Bush reading the Koran upside-down .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA George Bush target practice -DASH -DASH shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore .PERIOD 
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at ,COMMA and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible .PERIOD .PERIOD 
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block ,COMMA and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind ,COMMA and the seriousness ,COMMA or the intellect ,COMMA of Bush .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA commenting on the behind the scenes -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA as we know now -DASH -DASH what goes on in prisons .PERIOD 
And really commenting ,COMMA you know ,COMMA based on the perception we have of the celebrities .PERIOD 
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life ,COMMA and the fact that he tried to .. .PERIOD he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes ,COMMA so I'm constantly going up to people in the street and trying to ask people to come and be in one of my photographs or films .PERIOD 
And sometimes asking the real celebrity ,COMMA mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person ,COMMA which is highly embarrassing .PERIOD .PERIOD 
I've also been working with The Guardian on a topical basis -DASH -DASH a page a week in their newspaper -DASH -DASH which has been very interesting ,COMMA working topically .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA Jamie Oliver and school dinners ;SEMICOLON Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture ;SEMICOLON the whole of the hunting issue ,COMMA and the royal family refusing to stop hunting ;SEMICOLON and the tsunami issues ;SEMICOLON and obviously Harry ;SEMICOLON Blair's views on Gordon Brown ,COMMA which I find very interesting ;SEMICOLON Condi and Bush .PERIOD 
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it .PERIOD 
I made it a year ago .PERIOD And just how meanings change ,COMMA and there were a terrible thing that has happened ,COMMA but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that .PERIOD 
That's why this image was made one year ago ,COMMA and what it means today .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I'll leave you with these clips to have a look .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder :COLON schizophrenia .PERIOD And as a sister and later ,COMMA as a scientist ,COMMA I wanted to understand ,COMMA why is it that I can take my dreams ,COMMA I can connect them to my reality ,COMMA and I can make my dreams come true ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality ,COMMA so they instead become delusion ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses .PERIOD And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston ,COMMA where I was working in the lab of Dr .PERIOD Francine Benes ,COMMA in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry .PERIOD And in the lab ,COMMA we were asking the question ,COMMA What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control ,COMMA as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia ,COMMA schizoaffective or bipolar disorder ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain :COLON which cells are communicating with which cells ,COMMA with which chemicals ,COMMA and then in what quantities of those chemicals ?QUESTIONMARK 
But then in the evenings and on the weekends ,COMMA I traveled as an advocate for NAMI ,COMMA the National Alliance on Mental Illness .PERIOD 
But on the morning of December <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own .PERIOD 
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain .PERIOD 
And in the course of four hours ,COMMA I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information .PERIOD On the morning of the hemorrhage ,COMMA I could not walk ,COMMA talk ,COMMA read ,COMMA write or recall any of my life .PERIOD 
I essentially became an infant in a woman's body .PERIOD 
If you've ever seen a human brain ,COMMA it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .PERIOD 
And I have brought for you a real human brain .PERIOD 
So this is a real human brain .PERIOD 
This is the front of the brain ,COMMA the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down ,COMMA and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head .PERIOD 
And when you look at the brain ,COMMA it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another .PERIOD 
For those of you who understand computers ,COMMA our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor ,COMMA while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor .PERIOD 
The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus collosum ,COMMA which is made up of some <NUM> million axonal fibers .PERIOD 
But other than that ,COMMA the two hemispheres are completely separate .PERIOD 
Because they process information differently ,COMMA each of our hemispheres think about different things ,COMMA they care about different things ,COMMA and ,COMMA dare I say ,COMMA they have very different personalities .PERIOD 
Excuse me .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD It's been a joy .PERIOD Assistant :COLON It has been .PERIOD 
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment .PERIOD 
It's all about right here ,COMMA right now .PERIOD 
Our right hemisphere ,COMMA it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies .PERIOD 
Information ,COMMA in the form of energy ,COMMA streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like ,COMMA what this present moment smells like and tastes like ,COMMA what it feels like and what it sounds like .PERIOD 
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .PERIOD 
We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family .PERIOD 
And right here ,COMMA right now ,COMMA we are brothers and sisters on this planet ,COMMA here to make the world a better place .PERIOD 
And in this moment we are perfect ,COMMA we are whole and we are beautiful .PERIOD 
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .PERIOD 
Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details ,COMMA details and more details about those details .PERIOD 
It then categorizes and organizes all that information ,COMMA associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned ,COMMA and projects into the future all of our possibilities .PERIOD 
And our left hemisphere thinks in language .PERIOD 
It's that little voice that says to me ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home .PERIOD 
I need them in the morning .PERIOD 
It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry .PERIOD But perhaps most important ,COMMA it's that little voice that says to me ,COMMA I am .PERIOD I am .PERIOD And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am ,COMMA I become separate .PERIOD 
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke .PERIOD 
On the morning of the stroke ,COMMA I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye .PERIOD And it was the kind of pain -DASH -DASH caustic pain -DASH -DASH that you get when you bite into ice cream .PERIOD And it just gripped me -DASH -DASH and then it released me .PERIOD And then it just gripped me -DASH -DASH and then it released me .PERIOD And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain ,COMMA so I thought ,COMMA OK ,COMMA I'll just start my normal routine .PERIOD 
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider ,COMMA which is a full-body ,COMMA full-exercise machine .PERIOD 
And I'm jamming away on this thing ,COMMA and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar .PERIOD And I thought ,COMMA That's very peculiar .PERIOD 
And it was all very peculiar ,COMMA and my headache was just getting worse .PERIOD So I get off the machine ,COMMA and I'm walking across my living room floor ,COMMA and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down .PERIOD And every step is very rigid and very deliberate .PERIOD There's no fluidity to my pace ,COMMA and there's this constriction in my area of perceptions ,COMMA so I'm just focused on internal systems .PERIOD 
And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower ,COMMA and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body .PERIOD I heard a little voice saying ,COMMA OK .PERIOD You muscles ,COMMA you gotta contract .PERIOD 
You muscles ,COMMA you relax .PERIOD 
And then I lost my balance ,COMMA and I'm propped up against the wall .PERIOD 
And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body .PERIOD 
And all I could detect was this energy -DASH -DASH energy .PERIOD 
And I'm asking myself ,COMMA What is wrong with me ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is going on ?QUESTIONMARK And in that moment ,COMMA my brain chatter -DASH -DASH my left hemisphere brain chatter -DASH -DASH went totally silent .PERIOD 
Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button .PERIOD Total silence .PERIOD 
And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind .PERIOD But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me .PERIOD 
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body ,COMMA I felt enormous and expansive .PERIOD 
I felt at one with all the energy that was ,COMMA and it was beautiful there .PERIOD 
Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online ,COMMA and it says to me ,COMMA Hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK We got a problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
We got a problem !EXCLAMATIONMARK We gotta get some help .PERIOD 
And I'm going ,COMMA Ahh !EXCLAMATIONMARK I got a problem .PERIOD 
I got a problem .PERIOD So it's like ,COMMA OK .PERIOD OK .PERIOD I got a problem .PERIOD 
But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -DASH -DASH and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land .PERIOD 
But it was beautiful there .PERIOD Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world .PERIOD 
So here I am in this space ,COMMA and my job -DASH -DASH and any stress related to my job -DASH -DASH it was gone .PERIOD 
And I felt lighter in my body .PERIOD And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those -DASH -DASH they were gone .PERIOD 
And I felt this sense of peacefulness .PERIOD 
And imagine what it would feel like to lose <NUM> years of emotional baggage !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Oh !EXCLAMATIONMARK I felt euphoria -DASH -DASH euphoria .PERIOD It was beautiful .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA again ,COMMA my left hemisphere comes online and it says ,COMMA Hey !EXCLAMATIONMARK You've got to pay attention .PERIOD 
We've got to get help .PERIOD And I'm thinking ,COMMA I got to get help .PERIOD 
I gotta focus .PERIOD 
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment ,COMMA and I'm thinking ,COMMA I gotta get to work .PERIOD I gotta get to work .PERIOD 
Can I drive ?QUESTIONMARK Can I drive ?QUESTIONMARK 
And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side .PERIOD Then I realized ,COMMA Oh my gosh !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm having a stroke !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm having a stroke !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And the next thing my brain says to me is ,COMMA Wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
This is so cool .PERIOD This is so cool !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then it crosses my mind ,COMMA But I'm a very busy woman !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I don't have time for a stroke !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So I'm like ,COMMA OK ,COMMA I can't stop the stroke from happening ,COMMA so I'll do this for a week or two ,COMMA and then I'll get back to my routine .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
So I gotta call help .PERIOD I gotta call work .PERIOD 
I couldn't remember the number at work ,COMMA so I remembered ,COMMA in my office I had a business card with my number on it .PERIOD So I go into my business room ,COMMA I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards .PERIOD 
And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like ,COMMA I couldn't tell if this was my card or not ,COMMA because all I could see were pixels .PERIOD 
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols ,COMMA and I just couldn't tell .PERIOD 
And in that moment ,COMMA I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card .. .PERIOD that's not the card .. .PERIOD that's not the card .PERIOD 
It took me <NUM> minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards .PERIOD 
In the meantime ,COMMA for <NUM> minutes ,COMMA the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere .PERIOD 
I do not understand numbers ,COMMA I do not understand the telephone ,COMMA but it's the only plan I have .PERIOD 
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here .PERIOD I take the business card ,COMMA I put it right here ,COMMA and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad .PERIOD 
But then I would drift back out into La La Land ,COMMA and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers .PERIOD 
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them ,COMMA so that as I would come back to normal reality ,COMMA I'd be able to tell ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA I've already dialed that number .PERIOD 
Eventually ,COMMA the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone ,COMMA and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me ,COMMA Woo woo woo woo .PERIOD And I think to myself ,COMMA Oh my gosh ,COMMA he sounds like a Golden Retriever !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And what comes out of my voice is ,COMMA Woo woo woo woo woo .PERIOD 
I'm thinking ,COMMA Oh my gosh ,COMMA I sound like a Golden Retriever .PERIOD 
So I couldn't know -DASH -DASH I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried .PERIOD 
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help .PERIOD 
And a little while later ,COMMA I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital .PERIOD 
And I curl up into a little fetal ball .PERIOD 
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air ,COMMA just ,COMMA just right out of the balloon ,COMMA I just felt my energy lift and just -DASH -DASH I felt my spirit surrender .PERIOD 
And in that moment ,COMMA I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life .PERIOD 
And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life ,COMMA or this was perhaps my moment of transition .PERIOD 
When I woke later that afternoon ,COMMA I was shocked to discover that I was still alive .PERIOD When I felt my spirit surrender ,COMMA I said goodbye to my life .PERIOD 
And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality .PERIOD Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain .PERIOD 
Light burned my brain like wildfire ,COMMA and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise ,COMMA and I just wanted to escape .PERIOD Because I could not identify the position of my body in space ,COMMA I felt enormous and expansive ,COMMA like a genie just liberated from her bottle .PERIOD 
And my spirit soared free ,COMMA like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria .PERIOD 
But then I realized ,COMMA But I'm still alive !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm still alive ,COMMA and I have found Nirvana .PERIOD And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive ,COMMA then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana .PERIOD And I pictured a world filled with beautiful ,COMMA peaceful ,COMMA compassionate ,COMMA loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time .PERIOD And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace .PERIOD And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be ,COMMA what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives .PERIOD And it motivated me to recover .PERIOD 
Here I am with my mama ,COMMA who is a true angel in my life .PERIOD It took me eight years to completely recover .PERIOD 
So who are we ?QUESTIONMARK We are the life-force power of the universe ,COMMA with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds .PERIOD 
And we have the power to choose ,COMMA moment by moment ,COMMA who and how we want to be in the world .PERIOD 
Right here ,COMMA right now ,COMMA I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere ,COMMA where we are .PERIOD 
I am the life-force power of the universe .PERIOD 
I am the life-force power of the <NUM> trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form ,COMMA at one with all that is .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere ,COMMA where I become a single individual ,COMMA a solid .PERIOD Separate from the flow ,COMMA separate from you .PERIOD I am Dr .PERIOD Jill Bolte Taylor :COLON intellectual ,COMMA neuroanatomist .PERIOD These are the we inside of me .PERIOD 
Which would you choose ?QUESTIONMARK Which do you choose ?QUESTIONMARK And when ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading .PERIOD 
It is interesting that in the United States ,COMMA the most significant health-care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care ,COMMA whether it's private or public .PERIOD 
There's no comparison at all .PERIOD 
And that situation cannot be right .PERIOD We must do something about it .PERIOD 
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation .PERIOD

<NUM> million heart attacks and strokes occur .PERIOD 
Most of this is in developing countries ,COMMA and the majority is in Africa .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -DASH -DASH not in the West -DASH -DASH and yet <NUM> percent of the resources are in the West .PERIOD 
Who is at risk ?QUESTIONMARK People like you .PERIOD 
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that .PERIOD 
All friends of Africa ,COMMA that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time ,COMMA should be very concerned about this deplorable situation .PERIOD

By the time you get to <NUM> ,COMMA it's almost no one left in Nigeria -DASH -DASH life expectancy is <NUM> .PERIOD 
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses -DASH -DASH they do -DASH -DASH but they do not survive after the time that they reach about <NUM> years old and <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
And those are the times they're most productive .PERIOD 
Those are the times that they should be contributing to Africa's development .PERIOD But they're not there .PERIOD 
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents .PERIOD 
What are the risk factors ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's very well known .PERIOD I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those .PERIOD 
Right here in Tanzania ,COMMA <NUM> percent of individuals have hypertension .PERIOD

Easy to treat .PERIOD Look at the situation in Mauritius .PERIOD 
In eight short years -DASH -DASH we're here talking about HIV ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA which is all good .PERIOD 
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV .PERIOD 
In eight short years ,COMMA non-communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in Africa .PERIOD 
That is something to keep in mind .PERIOD We can't deal with it with situations like this .PERIOD 
This is a typical African hospital .PERIOD We can't depend on the elites -DASH -DASH they go to USA ,COMMA Germany ,COMMA U.K .PERIOD for treatment .PERIOD Unbelievable .PERIOD 
You can't depend on foreign aid alone .PERIOD 
Here is the situation :COLON countries are turning inwards .PERIOD 
Post-9/<NUM> ,COMMA [the] United States has had a lot of trouble to deal with ,COMMA their own internal issues .PERIOD 
You can't rightly -DASH -DASH it's not their responsibility ,COMMA it is my responsibility .PERIOD I have to take care of my own problems .PERIOD 
If they help ,COMMA that's good !EXCLAMATIONMARK But that is not my expectation .PERIOD 
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa demand a new look .PERIOD We cannot keep on doing things the way we've always done them .PERIOD 
If they have not worked ,COMMA we have to look for alternative solutions .PERIOD 
I'm here to talk to you about solutions .PERIOD 
This has been -DASH -DASH what has been a difficult sign to some of us .PERIOD 
Several years ago ,COMMA we started thinking about it .PERIOD 
Everyone knows the problem .PERIOD No one knows what the solutions are .PERIOD 
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is .PERIOD 
Everyone is ready to throw in money ,COMMA in terms of free money aid to developing countries .PERIOD 
Talk about sustainable investment ,COMMA no one is interested .PERIOD 
You can't raise money .PERIOD 
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States -DASH -DASH I live in Nashville ,COMMA Tennessee ,COMMA health care capital of America .PERIOD 
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures .PERIOD 
But start telling them ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -DASH -DASH everyone runs away .PERIOD 
That is totally wrong .PERIOD Those of you in the audience here ,COMMA if you want to help Africa ,COMMA invest money in sustainable development .PERIOD 
Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute ,COMMA so you get a glimpse of what we do ,COMMA and I'll talk a little bit more about it .PERIOD 
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care ,COMMA comparable to the best anywhere in the world ,COMMA can be done in a developing country environment .PERIOD 
We have <NUM> positions right now -DASH -DASH all of them trained ,COMMA board certified in the USA ,COMMA Canada or Britain .PERIOD 
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt ,COMMA Cleveland Clinic -DASH -DASH everywhere in the U.S .PERIOD -DASH -DASH and we do it for about <NUM> percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the United States .PERIOD 
Additionally ,COMMA we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay .PERIOD 
We take care of everyone .PERIOD 
Whether you have one dollar ,COMMA two dollars -DASH -DASH it doesn't matter .PERIOD 
And I will tell you how we're able to do it .PERIOD 
We make sure that we select our equipment properly .PERIOD 
We go for modular units .PERIOD Units that have multi-modality functions have modular components .PERIOD Easy to repair ,COMMA and because of that ,COMMA we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last .PERIOD 
We emphasize training ,COMMA and we make sure that this process is regenerative .PERIOD 
Very soon we will all be dead and gone ,COMMA but the problems will stay ,COMMA unless we have people taking over from where we stopped .PERIOD 
We made sure that we produced some things ourselves .PERIOD 
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals .PERIOD 
We get the generators from the companies .PERIOD 
We manufacture them in-house ,COMMA ourselves .PERIOD That keeps the costs down .PERIOD 
We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .PERIOD 
All these problems we're talking about -DASH -DASH if we bring development ,COMMA they will all disappear .PERIOD 
Technology is a great equalizer .PERIOD How do we make it work ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's been proved :COLON self-care is cost-effective .PERIOD 
It extends opportunity to the rural centers ,COMMA and we can use expertise in a very smart way .PERIOD 
This is the way our centers are set up .PERIOD 
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean ,COMMA and we're planning a fourth one .PERIOD 
And we have now decided to go into Africa .PERIOD 
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute in Port Harcourt ,COMMA Nigeria .PERIOD That project will be starting within the next few months .PERIOD We hope to open in 2008-09 .PERIOD 
And we will do other centers .PERIOD 
This model can be adapted to every disease process .PERIOD 
All the units ,COMMA all the centers ,COMMA are linked through a switched hub to a central server ,COMMA and all the images are populated to review stations .PERIOD 
And we designed this telemedicine solution .PERIOD It's proprietary to us ,COMMA and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it .PERIOD You can still be profitable .PERIOD 
We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world ,COMMA just by a click of the button .PERIOD 
I'll lead you through ,COMMA to see how this happens .PERIOD 
I can call you in Switzerland and say ,COMMA Listen ,COMMA go into our system .PERIOD 
Look at Mrs .PERIOD Jones .PERIOD Look at the study ,COMMA tell me what you think .PERIOD 
The patient doesn't have to travel .PERIOD 
He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise .PERIOD 
We also use [an] electronic medical record system .PERIOD 
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented -DASH -DASH <NUM> percent of U.S .PERIOD practices do not have them ,COMMA and yet the technology is there .PERIOD 
But you know ,COMMA they have that luxury .PERIOD 
When we do it ,COMMA we will put the cost of care down .PERIOD 
And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable .PERIOD 
And everyone will get the care they deserve .PERIOD 
It cannot just be technology ,COMMA we recognize that .PERIOD 
Prevention must be part of the solution -DASH -DASH we emphasize that .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you have to tell people what can be done .PERIOD 
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive ,COMMA and they go home and can't do it .PERIOD 
They need to be alive ,COMMA they need to feed .PERIOD 
We recommend exercise as the most effective ,COMMA simple ,COMMA easy thing to do .PERIOD 
We have had walks every year -DASH -DASH every March ,COMMA April .PERIOD 
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges .PERIOD 
Which group loses the most weight ,COMMA we give them prizes .PERIOD 
Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer ,COMMA we give them prizes .PERIOD We do this constantly .PERIOD 
We encourage them to bring children .PERIOD 
That way we start exposing the children from very early on ,COMMA on what these issues are .PERIOD Because once they learn it ,COMMA they will stay with it .PERIOD In doing this we have created at least <NUM> skilled jobs in Jamaica alone ,COMMA and these are physicians with expertise and special training .PERIOD 
We have taken care of over <NUM> indigent patients that could have died ,COMMA including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block .PERIOD For those that understand cardiology ,COMMA complete heart block means certain death .PERIOD 
If you don't get this pacemaker ,COMMA you will be dead .PERIOD 
So we are pleased with that .PERIOD 
Indirectly ,COMMA we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care .PERIOD 
And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives .PERIOD 
By the end of this year ,COMMA we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care .PERIOD In the first four months ,COMMA it's been <NUM> dollars ,COMMA averaging <NUM> dollars a month .PERIOD The government will not do that ,COMMA because they have competing needs .PERIOD 
They need to put resources elsewhere .PERIOD But we can still do it .PERIOD 
People say ,COMMA How can you do that ?QUESTIONMARK This is how we can do that .PERIOD 
At least <NUM> rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA if they went to Miami ,COMMA they will spend significantly more -DASH -DASH eight to <NUM> times more .PERIOD And they feel happy spending it at home ,COMMA getting the same quality of care .PERIOD 
And for that money -DASH -DASH for every one patient that has the money to pay ,COMMA it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay .PERIOD 
For this to work ,COMMA this progress must be sustainable .PERIOD 
We have gone further :COLON we have formed a relationship with the University of Technology ,COMMA Jamaica ,COMMA where I now have an appointment .PERIOD 
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program ,COMMA so that we will train people locally ,COMMA who can repair that equipment .PERIOD 
That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues .PERIOD 
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -DASH -DASH training people in echocardiography ,COMMA cardiac ultrasound ,COMMA those kinds of things .PERIOD Now ,COMMA with that kind of training ,COMMA it gives people motivation .PERIOD 
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff .PERIOD In the process ,COMMA I want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD Jason Topping :COLON My name is Jason Topping .PERIOD 
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the University Hospital of the West Indies .PERIOD 
I came to the Heart Institute in <NUM> ,COMMA as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program .PERIOD 
I spent three months at the Heart Institute .PERIOD 
There's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training I received here ,COMMA and I think there's been an increased interest now in -DASH -DASH particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting .PERIOD 
I think this aspect of training in cardiology that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases .PERIOD 
Ernest Madu :COLON The lesson in this is that it can be done ,COMMA and it can be sustained ,COMMA and you can make it possible for everyone .PERIOD 
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care ?QUESTIONMARK 
When have you been appointed to play God ?QUESTIONMARK 
It is not my decision .PERIOD My job is to make sure that every person ,COMMA no matter what fate has assigned to you ,COMMA will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life .PERIOD 
Next stop is West African Heart Institute ,COMMA that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt ,COMMA Nigeria ,COMMA as I said before .PERIOD We will do other centers across West Africa .PERIOD 
We will extend the same system into other areas ,COMMA like dialysis treatment .PERIOD 
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation ,COMMA we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it ,COMMA and how you can do it .PERIOD If we do this ,COMMA we can change the face of health care in Africa .PERIOD 
Africa has been good to us ;SEMICOLON it is time for us to give back to Africa .PERIOD 
I am going .PERIOD Those who want to come ,COMMA I welcome you to come along with me .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe -DASH -DASH the child remains non-verbal -DASH -DASH all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .PERIOD 
And I actually feel at home here ,COMMA because there's a lot of autism genetics here .PERIOD 
You wouldn't have any.. .PERIOD 
It's a continuum of traits .PERIOD 
When does a nerd turn into Asperger ,COMMA which is just mild autism ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today .PERIOD 
And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that Bill Gates talked about this morning .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD Now ,COMMA if you want to understand autism ,COMMA animals .PERIOD 
And I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking .PERIOD 
You have to get away from verbal language .PERIOD 
I think in pictures ,COMMA I don't think in language .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters ,COMMA or pick out the little letters ,COMMA and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA the normal brain ignores the details .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA if you're building a bridge ,COMMA details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details .PERIOD 
And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract .PERIOD 
People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff .PERIOD 
In my work with cattle ,COMMA I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk .PERIOD Like ,COMMA for example ,COMMA this flag waving ,COMMA right in front of the veterinary facility .PERIOD 
This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility ;SEMICOLON all they needed to do was move the flag .PERIOD 
Rapid movement ,COMMA contrast .PERIOD 
In the early '70s when I started ,COMMA I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing .PERIOD 
People thought that was crazy .PERIOD A coat on a fence would make them balk ,COMMA shadows would make them balk ,COMMA a hose on the floor .. .PERIOD 
people weren't noticing these things -DASH -DASH a chain hanging down -DASH -DASH and that's shown very ,COMMA very nicely in the movie .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I loved the movie ,COMMA how they duplicated all my projects .PERIOD That's the geek side .PERIOD 
My drawings got to star in the movie too .PERIOD 
And actually it's called Temple Grandin ,COMMA not Thinking In Pictures .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what is thinking in pictures ?QUESTIONMARK It's literally movies in your head .PERIOD 
My mind works like Google for images .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when I was a young kid I didn't know my thinking was different .PERIOD 
And then when I did my book ,COMMA Thinking In Pictures ,COMMA I start interviewing people about how they think .PERIOD 
And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different .PERIOD Like if I say ,COMMA Think about a church steeple most people get this sort of generalized generic one .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA maybe that's not true in this room ,COMMA but it's going to be true in a lot of different places .PERIOD 
I see only specific pictures .PERIOD 
They flash up into my memory ,COMMA just like Google for pictures .PERIOD 
And in the movie ,COMMA they've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said ,COMMA and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes pop into my imagination .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA how about famous ones ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they just kind of come up ,COMMA kind of like this .PERIOD 
Just really quickly ,COMMA like Google for pictures .PERIOD 
And they come up one at a time ,COMMA and then I think ,COMMA OK ,COMMA well maybe we can have it snow ,COMMA or we can have a thunderstorm ,COMMA and I can hold it there and turn them into videos .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities .PERIOD 
And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant .PERIOD 
I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides .PERIOD 
I've got that stuff up on YouTube if you want to look at it .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could actually test run a piece of equipment in my mind ,COMMA just like a virtual reality computer system .PERIOD 
And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie .PERIOD 
That was like just so super cool .PERIOD 
And there were a lot of kind of Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too .PERIOD 
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley ,COMMA where they belong .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social ,COMMA is I had to sell my work ,COMMA and not myself .PERIOD 
And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings ,COMMA I showed off pictures of things .PERIOD 
Another thing that helped me as a little kid is ,COMMA boy ,COMMA in the '50s ,COMMA you were taught manners .PERIOD 
You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when kids get to be in third or fourth grade ,COMMA you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker ,COMMA drawing in perspective .PERIOD Now ,COMMA I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I had this brain scan done several years ago ,COMMA and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex .PERIOD 
This is tensor imaging .PERIOD 
And my great big internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's .PERIOD 
The red lines there are me ,COMMA and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control .PERIOD 
And there I got a gigantic one ,COMMA and the control over there ,COMMA the blue one ,COMMA has got a really small one .PERIOD 
And some of the research now is showing is that people on the spectrum actually think with primary visual cortex .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the thing is ,COMMA the visual thinker's just one kind of mind .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind -DASH -DASH good at one thing ,COMMA bad at something else .PERIOD 
And where I was bad was algebra .PERIOD And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig .PERIOD 
Gigantic mistake :COLON I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra ,COMMA go right to geometry and trig .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA another kind of mind is the pattern thinker .PERIOD 
More abstract .PERIOD These are your engineers ,COMMA your computer programmers .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is pattern thinking .PERIOD That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper -DASH -DASH no scotch tape ,COMMA no cuts .PERIOD 
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it .PERIOD 
Here are the types of thinking :COLON photo-realistic visual thinkers ,COMMA like me ;SEMICOLON pattern thinkers ,COMMA music and math minds .PERIOD 
Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading .PERIOD 
You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic .PERIOD 
You'll see these different kinds of minds .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA another thing is the sensory issues .PERIOD 
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face .PERIOD 
But sensory is an issue .PERIOD Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights ;SEMICOLON others have problems with sound sensitivity .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's going to be variable .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind .PERIOD 
Think about how much information there is there on the local fire hydrant .PERIOD 
He knows who's been there ,COMMA when they were there .PERIOD 
It's all very detailed information ,COMMA and ,COMMA looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the animal mind ,COMMA and also my mind ,COMMA puts sensory-based information into categories .PERIOD 
Man on a horse and a man on the ground -DASH -DASH that is viewed as two totally different things .PERIOD 
You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider .PERIOD 
They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer ,COMMA but you can't ride him .PERIOD 
You have another horse ,COMMA where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground ,COMMA with the veterinarian ,COMMA but a person can ride him .PERIOD 
Cattle are the same way .PERIOD 
Man on a horse ,COMMA a man on foot -DASH -DASH they're two different things .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA it's a different picture .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA I want you to think about just how specific this is .PERIOD 
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant ,COMMA they don't seem to be able to figure out ,COMMA Do I have a training people issue ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or do I have something wrong with the equipment ?QUESTIONMARK 
In other words ,COMMA categorize equipment problem from a people problem .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem .PERIOD 
Or is the whole design of the system wrong ?QUESTIONMARK 
People have a hard time figuring that out .PERIOD 
Let's just look at something like ,COMMA you know ,COMMA solving problems with making airlines safer .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA five fatal wrecks in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA the tail either came off or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way .PERIOD 
It's tails ,COMMA pure and simple .PERIOD 
And when the pilots walk around the plane ,COMMA guess what ?QUESTIONMARK They can't see that stuff inside the tail .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA now as I think about that ,COMMA I'm pulling up all of that specific information .PERIOD 
It's specific .PERIOD See ,COMMA my thinking's bottom-up .PERIOD 
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats .PERIOD 
He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat .PERIOD 
White cowboy hats ,COMMA that was absolutely fine .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the thing is ,COMMA the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together .PERIOD 
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds .PERIOD 
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy ,COMMA as I travel around and I do autism meetings ,COMMA is I'm seeing a lot of smart ,COMMA geeky ,COMMA nerdy kids ,COMMA and they just aren't very social ,COMMA and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science .PERIOD 
And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher .PERIOD 
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie .PERIOD 
He was now Dr .PERIOD Carlock in the movie .PERIOD 
And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room .PERIOD 
This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED ,COMMA and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on .PERIOD 
Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky nerdy kids ,COMMA and the teachers out in the Midwest ,COMMA and the other parts of the country ,COMMA when you get away from these tech areas ,COMMA they don't know what to do with these kids .PERIOD 
The thing is ,COMMA you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind ,COMMA or your mind can be wired to be more social .PERIOD 
And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here ,COMMA in the really brilliant mind ,COMMA and we lose a few social circuits here .PERIOD 
It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social .PERIOD 
And then you can get into the point where it's so severe you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal .PERIOD 
In the normal human mind language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals .PERIOD 
This is the work of Dr .PERIOD Bruce Miller .PERIOD 
And he studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia .PERIOD 
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain ,COMMA and then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics ,COMMA but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence ,COMMA which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head .PERIOD 
And the Wolfram stuff -DASH -DASH I was taking notes and I was writing down all the search words I could use ,COMMA because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures .PERIOD 
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff .PERIOD 
And they've taken out the autoshop class and the drafting class and the art class .PERIOD 
I mean art was my best subject in school .PERIOD 
We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds ,COMMA and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds ,COMMA because we absolutely are going to need these kind of people in the future .PERIOD 
And let's talk about jobs .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA my science teacher got me studying because I was a goofball that didn't want to study .PERIOD 
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things ,COMMA like how to be on time .PERIOD 
I was taught that when I was eight years old .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA how to have table manners at granny's Sunday party .PERIOD 
I was taught that when I was very ,COMMA very young .PERIOD 
And when I was <NUM> ,COMMA I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes .PERIOD 
I did internships in college ,COMMA I was building things ,COMMA and I also had to learn how to do assignments .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little .PERIOD 
My mother said ,COMMA Well let's do a picture of something else .PERIOD 
They've got to learn how to do something else .PERIOD 
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos .PERIOD 
Let's get him working on building different things .PERIOD 
The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated .PERIOD 
Like if a kid loves racecars ,COMMA let's use racecars for math .PERIOD 
Let's figure out how long it takes a racecar to go a certain distance .PERIOD 
I really get fed up when they ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the teachers ,COMMA especially when you get away from this part of the country ,COMMA they don't know what to do with these smart kids .PERIOD 
It just drives me crazy .PERIOD 
What can visual thinkers do when they grow up ?QUESTIONMARK 
They can do graphic design ,COMMA all kinds of stuff with computers ,COMMA photography ,COMMA industrial design .PERIOD 
And then you've got the word minds .PERIOD They make great journalists ,COMMA and they also make really ,COMMA really good stage actors .PERIOD 
It's just kind of -DASH -DASH you just have to learn it .PERIOD 
And we need to be working with these students .PERIOD 
And this brings up mentors .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA my science teacher was not an accredited teacher .PERIOD 
He was a NASA space scientist .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology ,COMMA or a degree in chemistry ,COMMA you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry .PERIOD 
We need to be doing that .PERIOD 
Because what I'm observing is the good teachers ,COMMA for a lot of these kids ,COMMA are out in the community colleges ,COMMA but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .PERIOD 
Another thing that can be very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very successful is there is a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry ,COMMA and they can teach your kid .PERIOD 
And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old ,COMMA because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark .PERIOD 
You're getting that kid turned on .PERIOD 
And you get him turned on ,COMMA then he'll learn all the new stuff .PERIOD 
Mentors are just essential .PERIOD 
And we've got to mentor them ,COMMA hire them .PERIOD 
And if you bring them in for internships in your companies ,COMMA the thing about the autism ,COMMA Asperger-y kind of mind ,COMMA you've got to give them a specific task .PERIOD Don't just say ,COMMA Design new software .PERIOD 
You've got to tell them something a lot more specific :COLON Well ,COMMA we're designing a software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing .PERIOD 
And it can only use so much memory .PERIOD 
That's the kind of specificity you need .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that's the end of my talk .PERIOD 
And I just want to thank everybody for coming .PERIOD 
It was great to be here .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA you've got a question for me ?QUESTIONMARK OK .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Thank you so much for that .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA you once wrote ,COMMA I like this quote ,COMMA If by some magic ,COMMA autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth ,COMMA then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave .PERIOD 
Temple Grandin :COLON Because who do you think made the first stone spears ?QUESTIONMARK 
The Asperger guy .PERIOD And if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics there would be no more Silicon Valley ,COMMA and the energy crisis would not be solved .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I want to ask you a couple other questions ,COMMA and if any of these feel inappropriate ,COMMA it's okay just to say ,COMMA Next question .PERIOD 
But if there is someone here who has an autistic child ,COMMA or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them ,COMMA what advice would you give them ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you have a two ,COMMA three or four year old you know ,COMMA no speech ,COMMA no social interaction ,COMMA I can't emphasize enough :COLON Don't wait ,COMMA you need at least <NUM> hours a week of one-to-one teaching .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the thing is ,COMMA autism comes in different degrees .PERIOD 
There's going to be about half the people on the spectrum that are not going to learn to talk ,COMMA and they're not going to be working Silicon Valley ,COMMA that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do .PERIOD 
But then you get the smart ,COMMA geeky kids that have a touch of autism ,COMMA and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things .PERIOD 
I got social interaction through shared interest .PERIOD 
I rode horses with other kids ,COMMA I made model rockets with other kids ,COMMA did electronics lab with other kids ,COMMA and in the '60s ,COMMA it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show .PERIOD 
That was like ,COMMA we considered that super cool .PERIOD 
Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them ,COMMA as some might ,COMMA as most ,COMMA wish ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well let me tell you ,COMMA that child will be loyal ,COMMA and if your house is burning down ,COMMA they're going to get you out of it .PERIOD 
Wow .PERIOD So ,COMMA most people ,COMMA if you ask them what are they most passionate about ,COMMA they'd say things like ,COMMA My kids or My lover .PERIOD 
What are you most passionate about ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place .PERIOD 
When I have a mother of an autistic child say ,COMMA My kid went to college because of your book ,COMMA or one of your lectures ,COMMA that makes me happy .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the slaughter plants ,COMMA I've worked with them in the '80s ;SEMICOLON they were absolutely awful .PERIOD 
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes :COLON How many cattle fell down ?QUESTIONMARK 
How many cattle are mooing their heads off ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's very ,COMMA very simple .PERIOD 
You directly observe a few simple things .PERIOD 
It's worked really well .PERIOD I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world .PERIOD We need a lot more of that ,COMMA and a lot less abstract stuff .PERIOD 
When we were talking on the phone ,COMMA one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms .PERIOD Tell me about that .PERIOD 
Well the reason why I got really excited when I read about that ,COMMA it contains knowledge .PERIOD 
It's libraries .PERIOD 
And to me ,COMMA knowledge is something that is extremely valuable .PERIOD So ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA over <NUM> years ago now our library got flooded .PERIOD 
And this is before the Internet got really big .PERIOD 
And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked ,COMMA because it was knowledge being destroyed .PERIOD 
And server farms ,COMMA or data centers are great libraries of knowledge .PERIOD 
Well thank you so much .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
So magic is a very introverted field .PERIOD 
While scientists regularly publish their latest research ,COMMA we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets .PERIOD 
That's true even amongst peers .PERIOD 
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research ,COMMA or art as a form of R&amp ;SEMICOLON D for humanity ,COMMA then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .PERIOD 
And about three years ago ,COMMA I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -DASH -DASH tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .PERIOD 
It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system ,COMMA or a digital storytelling tool .PERIOD 
Could we bring down the lights please ?QUESTIONMARK Thank you .PERIOD 
So let's give this a try .PERIOD 
And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .PERIOD 
Terribly sorry .PERIOD I forgot the floor .PERIOD 
Wake up .PERIOD 
Hey .PERIOD 
Come on .PERIOD 
Please .PERIOD 
Come on .PERIOD 
Ah ,COMMA sorry about that .PERIOD 
Forgot this .PERIOD 
Give it another try .PERIOD 
He figured out the system .PERIOD 
Uh oh .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD Let's try this .PERIOD 
Come on .PERIOD 
Hey .PERIOD 
You heard her ,COMMA go ahead .PERIOD 
I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab] .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I don't recommend that you try to do that now .PERIOD 
Naturally ,COMMA they blew up a shack ,COMMA and Caltech ,COMMA well ,COMMA then ,COMMA hey ,COMMA you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there .PERIOD 
As I said ,COMMA they were adventurous people .PERIOD 
As a matter of fact ,COMMA one of them ,COMMA who was ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA part of a cult which was not too far from here on Orange Grove ,COMMA and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that gives you a kind of flavor of the kind of people we have there .PERIOD 
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up .PERIOD 
This one I thought I'd show you .PERIOD 
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd .PERIOD 
I tried to come like him this morning ,COMMA but as I walked out ,COMMA then it was too cold ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA I'd better put my shirt back on .PERIOD 
But more importantly ,COMMA the reason I wanted to show this picture :COLON look where the other people are looking ,COMMA and look where he is looking .PERIOD 
Wherever anybody else looks ,COMMA look somewhere else ,COMMA and go do something different ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and doing that .PERIOD 
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing .PERIOD 
And I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson that one of my colleagues ,COMMA you know ,COMMA put on my wall in my office ,COMMA and it says ,COMMA Do not go where the path may lead .PERIOD 
Go instead where there is no path ,COMMA and leave a trail .PERIOD 
And that's my recommendation to all of you :COLON look what everybody is doing ,COMMA what they are doing ;SEMICOLON go do something completely different .PERIOD 
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing ,COMMA because that doesn't get you very far .PERIOD 
In our early days we used to work a lot on rockets ,COMMA but we also used to have a lot of parties ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA one of our parties ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a few years ago .PERIOD 
But then a big difference happened about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA after Sputnik was launched .PERIOD We launched the first American satellite ,COMMA and that's the one you see on the left in there .PERIOD 
And here we made <NUM> degrees change :COLON we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house .PERIOD 
So you see ,COMMA on the bottom ,COMMA that rocket was supposed to go upward ;SEMICOLON somehow it ended going sideways .PERIOD 
So that's what we call the misguided missile .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we used to have a celebration every year and select -DASH -DASH there used to be competition and parades and so on .PERIOD 
It's not very appropriate to do it now .PERIOD Some people tell me to do it ;SEMICOLON I think ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's not really proper ,COMMA you know ,COMMA these days .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we do something a little bit more serious .PERIOD 
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl ,COMMA you know ,COMMA when we entered one of the floats .PERIOD 
That's more on the play side .PERIOD And on the right side ,COMMA that's the Rover just before we finished its testing to take it to the Cape to launch it .PERIOD 
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now .PERIOD 
So that kind of tells you about ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA the fun things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and the serious things that we try to do .PERIOD 
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have .PERIOD 
Video :COLON Morgan Hendry :COLON Beware of Safety is an instrumental rock band .PERIOD 
It branches on more the experimental side .PERIOD 
There's the improvisational side of jazz .PERIOD 
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock .PERIOD 
Being able to treat sound as an instrument ,COMMA and be able to dig for more abstract sounds and things to play live ,COMMA mixing electronics and acoustics .PERIOD 
The music's half of me ,COMMA but the other half -DASH -DASH I landed probably the best gig of all .PERIOD 
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab .PERIOD I'm building the next Mars Rover .PERIOD 
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them .PERIOD 
You've got to do what you want to do .PERIOD 
And anyone who tells you you can't ,COMMA you don't listen to them .PERIOD 
Tell them where to put it ,COMMA and then just do what you want to do .PERIOD 
I'm Morgan Hendry .PERIOD I am NASA .PERIOD 
Charles Elachi :COLON Now ,COMMA moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff ,COMMA always people ask ,COMMA why do we explore ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA the way I think about it is fairly simple .PERIOD 
Somehow ,COMMA <NUM> billion years ago there was a Big Bang ,COMMA and you've heard a little bit about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the origin of the universe .PERIOD 
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination -DASH -DASH or lots of people's imagination -DASH -DASH somehow from that original Big Bang we have this beautiful world that we live in today .PERIOD 
You look outside :COLON you have all that beauty that you see ,COMMA all that life that you see around you ,COMMA and here we have intelligent people like you and I who are having a conversation here .PERIOD 
All that started from that Big Bang .PERIOD So ,COMMA the question is :COLON How did that happen ?QUESTIONMARK How did that evolve ?QUESTIONMARK How did the universe form ?QUESTIONMARK 
How did the galaxies form ?QUESTIONMARK How did the planets form ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is that very common ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we literally are all made out of stardust .PERIOD 
We started from those stars ;SEMICOLON we are made of stardust .PERIOD 
You can skip the dust part .PERIOD 
But literally ,COMMA we are all made of stardust .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively write the book of how things have came about as they are today .PERIOD 
And one of the first ,COMMA or the easiest ,COMMA places we can go and explore that is to go towards Mars .PERIOD 
And the reason Mars takes particular attention :COLON it's not very far from us .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it'll take us only six months to get there .PERIOD 
Six to nine months at the right time of the year .PERIOD 
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth .PERIOD It's a little bit smaller ,COMMA but the land mass on Mars is about the same as the land mass on Earth ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if you don't take the oceans into account .PERIOD 
It has polar caps .PERIOD It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours ,COMMA so it has weather .PERIOD So ,COMMA it's very similar to some extent ,COMMA and you can see some of the features on it ,COMMA like the Grand Canyon on Mars ,COMMA or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars .PERIOD 
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth ,COMMA except a hell of a lot larger .PERIOD 
So it's about the size ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of the United States .PERIOD 
It has volcanoes on it .PERIOD And that's Mount Olympus on Mars ,COMMA which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet .PERIOD 
And if you look at the height of it and you compare it to Mount Everest ,COMMA you see ,COMMA it'll give you an idea of how large that Mount Olympus ,COMMA you know ,COMMA is ,COMMA relative to Mount Everest .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it basically dwarfs ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Mount Everest here on Earth .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events which have happened on that planet .PERIOD 
Recently from one of our satellites ,COMMA this shows that it's Earth-like -DASH -DASH we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening .PERIOD 
And these Rovers ,COMMA people wonder now ,COMMA what are they doing today ,COMMA so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing .PERIOD 
This is one very large crater .PERIOD Geologists love craters ,COMMA because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it ,COMMA and you can see what's below the surface .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is called Victoria Crater ,COMMA which is about a few football fields in size .PERIOD 
And if you look at the top left ,COMMA you see a little teeny dark dot .PERIOD 
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite .PERIOD 
If I zoom on it ,COMMA you can see :COLON that's the Rover on the surface .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that was taken from orbit ;SEMICOLON we had the camera zoom on the surface ,COMMA and we actually saw the Rover on the surface .PERIOD 
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images and the Rover to actually conduct science ,COMMA because we can observe large areas and then you can get those Rovers to move around and basically go to a certain location .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA specifically what we are doing now is that Rover is going down in that crater .PERIOD 
And the reason is ,COMMA many of you went to the Grand Canyon ,COMMA and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon ,COMMA you see these layers .PERIOD 
And what these layers -DASH -DASH that's what the surface used to be a million years ago ,COMMA <NUM> million years ago ,COMMA <NUM> million years ago ,COMMA and you get deposits on top of them .PERIOD 
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book ,COMMA and you can learn the history of what happened in the past in that location .PERIOD 
So what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall of that crater ,COMMA and the Rover is going down now ,COMMA measuring ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the properties and analyzing the rocks as it's going down ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that canyon .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving down a slope like this .PERIOD 
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers before we got them down -DASH -DASH or that Rover -DASH -DASH and made sure that it's all working well .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when I came last time ,COMMA shortly after the landing -DASH -DASH I think it was ,COMMA like ,COMMA a hundred days after the landing -DASH -DASH I told you I was surprised that those Rovers are lasting even a hundred days .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here we are four years later ,COMMA and they're still working .PERIOD 
Now you say ,COMMA Charles ,COMMA you are really lying to us ,COMMA and so on ,COMMA but that's not true .PERIOD We really believed they were going to last <NUM> days or <NUM> days ,COMMA because they are solar powered ,COMMA and Mars is a dusty planet ,COMMA so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface ,COMMA and after a while we wouldn't have enough power ,COMMA you know ,COMMA to keep them warm .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I always say it's important that you are smart ,COMMA but every once in a while it's good to be lucky .PERIOD 
It is like a brand new car that you have ,COMMA and that's literally why they have lasted so long .PERIOD 
And now we designed them reasonably well ,COMMA but that's exactly why they are lasting that long and still providing all the science data .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the two Rovers ,COMMA each one of them is ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA getting old .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA one of them ,COMMA one of the wheels is stuck ,COMMA is not working ,COMMA one of the front wheels ,COMMA so what we are doing ,COMMA we are driving it backwards .PERIOD 
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's not working very well ,COMMA so it's walking like this ,COMMA and we can move the arm ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that way .PERIOD 
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA during that whole period ,COMMA a number of people got excited ,COMMA you know ,COMMA outside the science community about these Rovers ,COMMA so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection about how these Rovers are being viewed by people other than the science community .PERIOD 
So let me go on the next short video .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place ,COMMA you know ,COMMA about four years ago .PERIOD 
Video :COLON Okay ,COMMA we have parachute aligned .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA deploy the airbags .PERIOD Open .PERIOD 
Camera .PERIOD We have a picture right now .PERIOD 
That's about what happened in the Houston operation room .PERIOD It's exactly like this .PERIOD 
Video :COLON Now ,COMMA if there is life ,COMMA the Dutch will find it .PERIOD 
What is he doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not too bad .PERIOD 
So anyway ,COMMA let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet .PERIOD 
As I said earlier ,COMMA it looked very much like Earth ,COMMA so you see sand dunes .PERIOD 
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken from the Sahara Desert or somewhere ,COMMA and you'd have believed me ,COMMA but these are pictures taken from Mars .PERIOD 
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us is the northern region ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of Mars ,COMMA close to the North Pole ,COMMA because we see ice caps ,COMMA and we see the ice caps shrinking and expanding ,COMMA so it's very much like you have in northern Canada .PERIOD 
And we wanted to find out -DASH -DASH and we see all kinds of glacial features on it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we wanted to find out ,COMMA actually ,COMMA what is that ice made of ,COMMA and could that have embedded in it some organic ,COMMA you know ,COMMA material .PERIOD 
So we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars ,COMMA called Phoenix ,COMMA and that spacecraft will land <NUM> days ,COMMA seven hours and <NUM> seconds from now ,COMMA so you can adjust your watch .PERIOD 
So it's on May <NUM> around just before five o'clock our time here on the West Coast ,COMMA actually we will be landing on another planet .PERIOD 
And as you can see ,COMMA this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars ,COMMA but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in <NUM> days ,COMMA I'll show you ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA a little bit of what's going to happen .PERIOD 
Video :COLON That's what we call the seven minutes of terror .PERIOD 
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples that we put them in an oven and actually heat them and look what gases will come from it .PERIOD 
So this was launched about nine months ago .PERIOD 
We'll be coming in at <NUM> miles per hour ,COMMA and in seven minutes we have to stop and touch the surface very softly so we don't break that lander .PERIOD 
Ben Cichy :COLON Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission .PERIOD 
Lynn Craig :COLON Where there tends to be water ,COMMA at least on Earth ,COMMA there tends to be life ,COMMA and so it's potentially a place where life could have existed on the planet in the past .PERIOD 
Erik Bailey :COLON The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling at <NUM> miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt in a soft way in a very short amount of time .PERIOD 
We enter the Martian atmosphere .PERIOD 
We're <NUM> miles above the surface of Mars .PERIOD 
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aero-shuttle .PERIOD 
Looks kind of like an ice cream cone ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD 
And on the front of it is this heat shield ,COMMA this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch of essentially what's cork on the front of it ,COMMA which is our heat shield .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is really special cork ,COMMA and this cork is what's going to protect us from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience .PERIOD 
Rob Grover :COLON Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft ,COMMA and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere to our advantage to slow us down .PERIOD 
From this point ,COMMA we're going to decelerate from <NUM> miles an hour down to <NUM> miles an hour .PERIOD 
The inside doesn't get very hot .PERIOD 
It probably gets about room temperature .PERIOD 
Richard Kornfeld :COLON There is this window of opportunity within which we can deploy the parachute .PERIOD 
If you fire the 'chute too early ,COMMA the parachute itself could fail .PERIOD 
And that would be bad .PERIOD 
In the first <NUM> seconds after we deploy the parachute ,COMMA we'll decelerate from <NUM> miles an hour to a relatively slow <NUM> miles an hour .PERIOD 
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us from the force of atmospheric entry ,COMMA so we jettison the heat shield ,COMMA exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars .PERIOD 
After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed ,COMMA the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect how far Phoenix really is from the ground .PERIOD 
We've lost <NUM> percent of our entry velocity .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're <NUM> percent of the way to where we want to be .PERIOD 
But that last one percent ,COMMA as it always seems to be ,COMMA is the tricky part .PERIOD 
Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute .PERIOD 
We separate from the lander going <NUM> miles an hour at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars :COLON <NUM> feet .PERIOD 
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another .PERIOD 
That's when we separate from the back shell ,COMMA and we're now in free-fall .PERIOD 
It's a very scary moment ;SEMICOLON a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time .PERIOD 
So it's in a free-fall ,COMMA but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land .PERIOD 
And then it has to light up its engines ,COMMA right itself ,COMMA and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely .PERIOD 
Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth .PERIOD 
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes .PERIOD 
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over .PERIOD 
We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely .PERIOD 
EDL is this immense ,COMMA technically challenging problem .PERIOD 
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour .PERIOD 
It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem .PERIOD 
Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here .PERIOD 
So it will be a very tense moment ,COMMA you know ,COMMA as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet .PERIOD 
So now let me talk about the next things that we are doing .PERIOD 
So we are in the process ,COMMA as we speak ,COMMA of actually designing the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars .PERIOD 
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA the steps we go through .PERIOD 
It's very similar to what you do when you design your product .PERIOD 
As you saw a little bit earlier ,COMMA when we were doing the Phoenix one ,COMMA we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing .PERIOD 
So we have to study all kinds of different materials ,COMMA the shape that we want to do .PERIOD 
In general we don't try to please the customer here .PERIOD 
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective ,COMMA you know ,COMMA an efficient kind of machine .PERIOD 
First we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can .PERIOD 
And we really love being close to the art center ,COMMA because we have ,COMMA as a matter of fact ,COMMA one of the alumni from the art center ,COMMA Eric Nyquist ,COMMA had put a series of displays ,COMMA far-out displays ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room ,COMMA just to get people to think wildly about things .PERIOD 
We have a bunch of Legos .PERIOD So ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA this is a playground for adults ,COMMA where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different designs .PERIOD 
Then we get a little bit more serious ,COMMA so we have what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved ,COMMA or scientists who are involved ,COMMA who know about thermal properties ,COMMA know about design ,COMMA know about atmospheric interaction ,COMMA parachutes ,COMMA all of these things ,COMMA which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent ,COMMA so to see ,COMMA does that meet the requirement that we need .PERIOD 
On the right ,COMMA also ,COMMA we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going .PERIOD 
If you are going to Jupiter ,COMMA you have a very high-radiation ,COMMA you know ,COMMA environment .PERIOD It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor .PERIOD 
So just imagine :COLON you take your P.C .PERIOD and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work .PERIOD 
So these are kind of some of the little challenges ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that we have to face .PERIOD 
If we are doing entry ,COMMA we have to do tests of parachutes .PERIOD 
You saw in the video a parachute breaking .PERIOD That would be a bad day ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if that happened ,COMMA so we have to test ,COMMA because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds .PERIOD 
We are coming at extremely high speeds ,COMMA and we are deploying them to slow us down .PERIOD So we have to do all kinds of tests .PERIOD 
To give you an idea of the size ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of that parachute relative to the people standing there .PERIOD 
Next step ,COMMA we go and actually build some kind of test models and actually test them ,COMMA you know ,COMMA in the lab at JPL ,COMMA in what we call our Mars Yard .PERIOD 
And then we back off ,COMMA you know ,COMMA from that point .PERIOD 
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight .PERIOD 
And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car .PERIOD 
That big shield that you see outside ,COMMA that's a heat shield which is going to protect it .PERIOD 
And that will be basically built over the next year ,COMMA and it will be launched June a year from now .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in that case ,COMMA because it was a very big Rover ,COMMA we couldn't use airbags .PERIOD 
Unfortunately this Rover is ,COMMA like ,COMMA ten times the size of the ,COMMA you know ,COMMA mass-wise ,COMMA of the other Rover ,COMMA or three times the mass .PERIOD 
So we can't use airbags .PERIOD So we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it .PERIOD 
And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn't want to contaminate the surface ;SEMICOLON we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs .PERIOD 
So we came up with this ingenious idea ,COMMA which is used here on Earth for helicopters .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA the lander will come down to about <NUM> feet and hover above that surface for <NUM> feet ,COMMA and then we have a sky crane which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface .PERIOD 
Hopefully it all will work ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it will work that way .PERIOD 
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist .PERIOD 
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around ,COMMA it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks .PERIOD 
So it will have an arm which will take samples ,COMMA put them in an oven ,COMMA crush and analyze them .PERIOD 
But also ,COMMA if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff ,COMMA we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock ,COMMA evaporate some of it ,COMMA and actually analyze what's coming from that rock .PERIOD 
So it's a little bit like Star Wars ,COMMA you know ,COMMA but it's real .PERIOD 
And also to help you ,COMMA to help the community so you can do ads on that Rover ,COMMA we are going to train that Rover to actually in addition to do this ,COMMA to actually serve cocktails ,COMMA you know ,COMMA also on Mars .PERIOD 
So that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA fun things we are doing on Mars .PERIOD 
I thought I'd go to The Lord of the Rings now and show you some of the things we have there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA The Lord of the Rings has two things played through it .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA it's a very attractive planet -DASH -DASH it just has the beauty of the rings and so on .PERIOD 
But for scientists ,COMMA also the rings have a special meaning ,COMMA because we believe they represent ,COMMA on a small scale ,COMMA how the Solar System actually formed .PERIOD 
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed ,COMMA that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun ,COMMA a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together ,COMMA and they formed bigger rocks ,COMMA and then that's how the planets ,COMMA you know ,COMMA were formed .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA I'm going to fly you over the rings .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA all of this is real stuff .PERIOD 
This is not animation or anything like this .PERIOD 
This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn ,COMMA the Cassini .PERIOD 
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings ,COMMA which are the particles .PERIOD 
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles .PERIOD 
So that's why you have these gaps ,COMMA is because a small satellite ,COMMA you know ,COMMA is being formed in that location .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA they are very large in one dimension ;SEMICOLON in the other dimension they are paper thin .PERIOD Very ,COMMA very thin .PERIOD 
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself .PERIOD 
And that's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA think about it as a paper-thin ,COMMA huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles ,COMMA which is rotating .PERIOD 
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form ,COMMA each one looking very different and very odd ,COMMA and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this ,COMMA and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like ,COMMA or why they formed that way .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there were two satellites which were particularly interesting .PERIOD 
One of them is called Enceladus .PERIOD 
It's a satellite which was all made of ice ,COMMA and we measured it from orbit .PERIOD Made of ice .PERIOD 
But there was something bizarre about it .PERIOD 
If you look at these stripes in here ,COMMA what we call tiger stripes ,COMMA when we flew over them ,COMMA all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature ,COMMA which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet .PERIOD 
So as we flew by away from it ,COMMA we looked back .PERIOD And guess what ?QUESTIONMARK 
We saw geysers coming out .PERIOD 
So this is a Yellowstone ,COMMA you know ,COMMA of Saturn .PERIOD 
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet ,COMMA which indicate that most likely there is an ocean ,COMMA you know ,COMMA below the surface .PERIOD 
And somehow ,COMMA through some dynamic effect ,COMMA we're having these geysers which are being ,COMMA you know ,COMMA emitted from it .PERIOD 
And the reason I showed the little arrow there ,COMMA I think that should say <NUM> miles ,COMMA we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of .PERIOD 
We flew at the top of it ,COMMA and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice .PERIOD 
And over the next few years ,COMMA as we keep orbiting ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Saturn ,COMMA we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA another satellite also attracted a lot of attention ,COMMA and that's Titan .PERIOD And the reason Titan is particularly interesting ,COMMA it's a satellite bigger than our moon ,COMMA and it has an atmosphere .PERIOD 
And that atmosphere is very -DASH -DASH as dense as our own atmosphere .PERIOD 
So if you were on Titan ,COMMA you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here .PERIOD Except it's a lot colder ,COMMA and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA methane gets people all excited ,COMMA because it's organic material ,COMMA so immediately people start thinking ,COMMA could life have evolved in that location ,COMMA when you have a lot of organic material .PERIOD 
So it could be Earth ,COMMA frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it .PERIOD 
So that's getting a lot of interest ,COMMA and to show you some example of what we did in there ,COMMA we actually dropped a probe ,COMMA which was developed by our colleagues in Europe ,COMMA we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn .PERIOD 
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan .PERIOD 
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down .PERIOD 
Just looked like the coast of California for me .PERIOD 
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast ,COMMA and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island ,COMMA and that looks like an ocean .PERIOD 
And then with an instrument we have on board ,COMMA a radar instrument ,COMMA we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here ,COMMA so it looks very much like Earth .PERIOD 
It looks like there are rivers on it ,COMMA there are oceans or lakes ,COMMA we know there are clouds .PERIOD We think it's raining also on it .PERIOD 
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it's so cold ,COMMA it could not be water ,COMMA you know ,COMMA because water would have frozen .PERIOD 
What it turned out ,COMMA that all that we are seeing ,COMMA all this liquid ,COMMA [is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane ,COMMA similar to what you put in your car .PERIOD 
So if you were on Mars -DASH -DASH sorry ,COMMA on Titan ,COMMA you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline .PERIOD 
You just drive to the nearest lake ,COMMA stick your hose in it ,COMMA and you've got your car filled up .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA if you light a match the whole planet will blow up .PERIOD 
So in closing ,COMMA I said I want to close by a couple of pictures .PERIOD 
And just to kind of put us in perspective ,COMMA this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn ,COMMA looking towards the Sun .PERIOD 
The Sun is behind Saturn ,COMMA so we see what we call forward scattering ,COMMA so it highlights all the rings .PERIOD And I'm going to zoom .PERIOD 
There is a -DASH -DASH I'm not sure you can see it very well ,COMMA but on the top left ,COMMA around <NUM> o'clock ,COMMA there is a little teeny dot ,COMMA and that's Earth .PERIOD 
You barely can see ourselves .PERIOD So what I did ,COMMA I thought I'd zoom on it .PERIOD 
So as you zoom in ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can see Earth ,COMMA you know ,COMMA just in the middle here .PERIOD So we zoomed all the way on the art center .PERIOD 
So thank you very much .PERIOD 
A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach ,COMMA I met Harriet .PERIOD 
We'd actually met online before -DASH -DASH not the way you're thinking .PERIOD 
We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey ,COMMA one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies .PERIOD 
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda ,COMMA she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA -DASH -DASH Haplotype K1a1b1a -DASH -DASH which meant that we were distantly related .PERIOD 
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman .PERIOD 
So Ozzie ,COMMA Harriet and me .PERIOD 
You're all welcome to join .PERIOD 
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference ,COMMA she'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T-shirts .PERIOD 
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary ,COMMA exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -DASH -DASH from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking .PERIOD 
We often think linearly .PERIOD 
But if you think about it ,COMMA if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day -DASH -DASH two ,COMMA four ,COMMA eight ,COMMA <NUM> -DASH -DASH in <NUM> days you have <NUM> .PERIOD 
What do you think you have in a month ?QUESTIONMARK We're at a billion .PERIOD 
So if we start to think exponentially ,COMMA we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .PERIOD 
And many of these technologies -DASH -DASH speaking as a physician and innovator -DASH -DASH we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care ,COMMA and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today ,COMMA ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population ,COMMA the way we really don't use information very well today ,COMMA the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation .PERIOD 
And one of the major things we can do we've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left .PERIOD 
We spend most of our money on the last <NUM> percent of life .PERIOD 
What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health ,COMMA leveraging technology as well ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now my favorite technology ,COMMA example of exponential technology ,COMMA we all have in our pocket .PERIOD 
So if you think about it ,COMMA these are really dramatically improving .PERIOD 
I mean this is the iPhone <NUM> .PERIOD 
Imagine what the iPhone <NUM> will be able to do .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I've gained some insight into this .PERIOD 
I've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley .PERIOD 
And we bring together every summer about <NUM> very talented students from around the world .PERIOD 
And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine ,COMMA biotech ,COMMA artificial intelligence ,COMMA robotics ,COMMA nanotechnology ,COMMA space ,COMMA and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals .PERIOD 
We also have seven-day executive programs .PERIOD 
Now I mentioned the phone .PERIOD 
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD .PERIOD 
I don't know if I'd try that yet ,COMMA but that's available .PERIOD 
There are all other sorts of applications ,COMMA merging your phone and diagnostics ,COMMA for example -DASH -DASH measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that ,COMMA potentially ,COMMA to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic .PERIOD 
So let's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care .PERIOD 
Well it's no secret that computers ,COMMA through Moore's law ,COMMA are speeding up faster and faster .PERIOD 
We have the ability to do more powerful things with them .PERIOD 
They're really approaching ,COMMA in many cases surpassing ,COMMA the ability of the human mind .PERIOD 
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging .PERIOD 
The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible .PERIOD 
And we're layering multiple technologies -DASH -DASH PET scans ,COMMA CT scans and molecular diagnostics -DASH -DASH to find and to seek things at different levels .PERIOD 
Here you're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today ,COMMA reconstructed of Marc Hodosh ,COMMA the curator of TEDMED .PERIOD 
And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available ,COMMA and essentially learn how to reconstruct ,COMMA and maybe even re-engineer ,COMMA or backwards engineer ,COMMA the brain so we can better understand pathology ,COMMA disease and therapy .PERIOD 
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections ,COMMA we're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective ,COMMA for example ,COMMA psychoactive drugs .PERIOD 
The scanners for these are getting small ,COMMA less expensive and more portable .PERIOD 
And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge .PERIOD 
The scan of today takes up about <NUM> books ,COMMA or <NUM> gigabytes .PERIOD 
How do you leverage that information ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's get personal .PERIOD I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy ,COMMA but if you're over age <NUM> ,COMMA it's time for your screening colonoscopy .PERIOD 
How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well now there's essentially a virtual colonoscopy .PERIOD 
Compare those two pictures ,COMMA and now as a radiologist ,COMMA you can essentially fly through your patient's colon and ,COMMA augmenting that with artificial intelligence ,COMMA identify potentially ,COMMA as you see here ,COMMA a lesion .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA we might have missed it ,COMMA but using A.I .PERIOD on top of radiology ,COMMA we can find lesions that were missed before .PERIOD 
And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn't have otherwise .PERIOD 
And this is an example of this paradigm shift .PERIOD 
We're moving to this integration of biomedicine ,COMMA information technology ,COMMA wireless and ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA mobile now -DASH -DASH this era of digital medicine .PERIOD 
So even my stethoscope is now digital .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA there's an app for that .PERIOD 
We're moving ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA to the era of the tricorder .PERIOD 
So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope .PERIOD 
These are now at a price point of -DASH -DASH what used to be <NUM> euros or a couple of hundred-thousand dollars -DASH -DASH for about <NUM> dollars ,COMMA I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand .PERIOD 
And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records -DASH -DASH in the United States ,COMMA we're still less than <NUM> percent electronic .PERIOD 
Here in the Netherlands ,COMMA I think it's more than <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
But now that we're switching to merging medical data ,COMMA making it available electronically ,COMMA we can crowd source that information ,COMMA and now as a physician ,COMMA I can access my patients' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device .PERIOD 
And just last month the first FDA-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .PERIOD 
So certainly ,COMMA the physicians of today ,COMMA including myself ,COMMA are completely reliable on these devices .PERIOD 
And as you saw just about a month ago ,COMMA Watson from IBM beat the two champions in Jeopardy .PERIOD 
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years ,COMMA when we've started to apply this cloud-based information ,COMMA when we really have the A.I .PERIOD physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done .PERIOD 
Already today ,COMMA you don't need to go to your physician in many cases .PERIOD 
Only for about <NUM> percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient .PERIOD 
We're now in the era of virtual visits -DASH -DASH from sort of the Skype-type visits you can do with American Well ,COMMA to Cisco that's developed a very complex health presence system .PERIOD 
And these are being augmented even by our devices again today .PERIOD 
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -DASH -DASH I can do some diagnostics that way .PERIOD 
Or might we be able to leverage today's gaming technology ,COMMA like the Microsoft Kinect ,COMMA and hack that to enable diagnostics ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in diagnosing stroke ,COMMA using simple motion detection ,COMMA using hundred-dollar devices .PERIOD 
We can actually now visit our patients robotically -DASH -DASH this is the RP7 ;SEMICOLON if I'm a hematologist ,COMMA visit another clinic ,COMMA visit a hospital .PERIOD 
These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now .PERIOD 
So imagine we already have wireless scales .PERIOD 
You can step on the scale .PERIOD 
You can Tweet your weight to your friends ,COMMA and they can keep you in line .PERIOD 
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs .PERIOD 
A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together .PERIOD 
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices ,COMMA we can put on a simple patch .PERIOD 
This was developed by colleagues at Stanford ,COMMA called the iRhythm -DASH -DASH completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity .PERIOD 
Now we're also in the era ,COMMA today ,COMMA of quantified self .PERIOD 
I can measure my steps ,COMMA my caloric outtake .PERIOD 
I can get insight into that on a daily basis .PERIOD 
I can share that with my friends ,COMMA with my physician .PERIOD 
There's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate ,COMMA the Zeo sleep monitors ,COMMA a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health .PERIOD 
And as we start to integrate this information ,COMMA we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies ,COMMA health and wellness .PERIOD 
There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .PERIOD 
And I would argue ,COMMA in the future ,COMMA we'll have wearable devices in our clothes ,COMMA monitoring ourselves <NUM>/<NUM> .PERIOD 
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars ,COMMA your red light might go on -DASH -DASH it won't say check engine though .PERIOD 
It's going to be check your body light ,COMMA and go in and get it taken care of .PERIOD 
Probably in a few years ,COMMA you'll check into your mirror and it's going to be diagnosing you .PERIOD 
For those of you with kiddos at home ,COMMA how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your .. .PERIOD 
too much information ,COMMA I think ,COMMA than you might need .PERIOD 
But it's going to be here .PERIOD 
Now we've heard a lot today about new technology and connection .PERIOD 
And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients ,COMMA and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine ,COMMA as augmented by these sorts of technologies .PERIOD 
Now we've talked about augmenting the patient ,COMMA to some degree .PERIOD 
How about augmenting the physician ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're now in the era of super-enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery ,COMMA which is here today ,COMMA at a level that was not really possible even five years ago .PERIOD 
Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality .PERIOD 
So the surgeon can see inside the patient ,COMMA through their lens ,COMMA where the tumor is ,COMMA where the blood vessels are .PERIOD 
This can be integrated with decisions support .PERIOD 
A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
And we're entering an era of really ,COMMA truly scarless surgery called NOTES ,COMMA where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically .PERIOD 
And this is called NOTES ,COMMA and this is coming -DASH -DASH basically scarless surgery ,COMMA as mediated by robotic surgery .PERIOD 
Now how about controlling other elements ?QUESTIONMARK 
For those who have disabilities -DASH -DASH the paraplegic -DASH -DASH there's the era of brain-computer interface ,COMMA or BCI ,COMMA where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA a robotic arm .PERIOD 
And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .PERIOD 
Still in clinical trials ,COMMA but imagine when we can connect these ,COMMA for example ,COMMA to the amazing bionic limb ,COMMA such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues ,COMMA which has <NUM> degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they've had in the past .PERIOD 
So we're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .PERIOD 
If you haven't lost a limb -DASH -DASH you've had a stroke ,COMMA for example -DASH -DASH you can wear these augmented limbs .PERIOD 
Or if you're a paraplegic -DASH -DASH like I've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics -DASH -DASH they've developed eLEGS .PERIOD 
I took this video last week .PERIOD Here's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons .PERIOD 
He's otherwise completely wheelchair-bound .PERIOD 
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics .PERIOD 
And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies ,COMMA we're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability ,COMMA or super-enabling .PERIOD 
This is Aimee Mullins ,COMMA who lost her lower limbs as a young child ,COMMA and Hugh Herr ,COMMA who's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident .PERIOD 
And now both of these can climb better ,COMMA move faster ,COMMA swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons .PERIOD 
Now how about other exponentials ?QUESTIONMARK 
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction ,COMMA including with huge costs .PERIOD 
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .PERIOD 
You can swallow this completely integrated device .PERIOD 
It can take pictures of your GI system ,COMMA help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract .PERIOD 
We get into even smaller micro-robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons can't do in a much less invasive manner .PERIOD 
Sometimes these might self-assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality .PERIOD 
On the cardiac side ,COMMA pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you don't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them .PERIOD 
And they're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely .PERIOD 
These are shrinking even further .PERIOD 
Here's one that's in prototyping by Medtronic that's smaller than a penny .PERIOD 
Artificial retinas ,COMMA the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA in early trials ,COMMA but moving into the future .PERIOD 
These are going to be game changing .PERIOD 
Or for those of us who are sighted ,COMMA how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?QUESTIONMARK 
BlueTooth ,COMMA WiFi available -DASH -DASH beams back images to your eye .PERIOD 
Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet ,COMMA it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you .PERIOD 
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ?QUESTIONMARK 
In fact ,COMMA the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .PERIOD 
We can now leverage microfluidics ,COMMA like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford .PERIOD 
Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians .PERIOD 
Put it on a chip ,COMMA enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care ,COMMA anywhere in the world .PERIOD 
If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther ,COMMA we're entering the era of nanomedicine ,COMMA the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system ,COMMA or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .PERIOD 
Now how about exponentially cheaper ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine ,COMMA but hard disks used to be <NUM> dollars for <NUM> megabytes -DASH -DASH exponentially cheaper .PERIOD 
In genomics now ,COMMA the genome cost about a billion dollars about <NUM> years ago when the first one came out .PERIOD 
We're now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome -DASH -DASH probably next year to two years ,COMMA probably a hundred-dollar genome .PERIOD 
What are we going to do with hundred-dollar genomes ?QUESTIONMARK 
And soon we'll have millions of these tests available .PERIOD 
And that's when it gets interesting ,COMMA when we start to crowdsource that information .PERIOD 
And we enter the era of true personalized medicine -DASH -DASH the right drug for the right person at the right time -DASH -DASH instead of what we're doing today ,COMMA which is the same drug for everybody -DASH -DASH sort of blockbuster drug medications ,COMMA medications which don't work for you ,COMMA the individual .PERIOD 
And many ,COMMA many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches .PERIOD 
And I'll also show you a simple example ,COMMA from 23andMe again .PERIOD 
But if I take that same data ,COMMA upload it to deCODEme ,COMMA I can look at my risk for sample Type II diabetes .PERIOD 
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example .PERIOD 
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics -DASH -DASH how my genes modulate ,COMMA what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important ,COMMA and once in the hands of the individual and the patient ,COMMA will make better drug dosing and selection available .PERIOD 
So again ,COMMA it's not just genes ,COMMA it's multiple details -DASH -DASH our habits ,COMMA our environmental exposure .PERIOD 
When was the last time your physician asked you where you've lived ?QUESTIONMARK 
Geomedicine :COLON where you've lived ,COMMA what you've been exposed to ,COMMA can dramatically affect your health .PERIOD 
So genomics ,COMMA proteomics ,COMMA the environment ,COMMA all this data streaming at us individually and us ,COMMA as poor physicians ,COMMA how do we manage it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well we're now entering the era of systems medicine ,COMMA or systems biology ,COMMA where we can start to integrate all of this information .PERIOD 
And by looking at the patterns ,COMMA for example ,COMMA in our blood of <NUM> biomarkers in a single test ,COMMA we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .PERIOD 
We're going to be predictive ;SEMICOLON we're going to know what you're likely to have .PERIOD 
We can be preventative ;SEMICOLON that prevention can be personalized ;SEMICOLON and more importantly ,COMMA it's going to become increasingly participatory .PERIOD 
Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health ,COMMA leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .PERIOD 
So I'll finish up with exponentially better .PERIOD 
We'd like to get therapies better and more effective .PERIOD 
Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .PERIOD 
What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is a new device that is essentially doing that .PERIOD 
It should be on the market within a year or two .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison .PERIOD 
We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells ,COMMA the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse .PERIOD 
So if you think of cancer as a weed ,COMMA we often can whack the weed away .PERIOD 
It seems to shrink ,COMMA but it often comes back .PERIOD 
So we're attacking the wrong target .PERIOD 
The cancer stem cells remain ,COMMA and the tumor can return months or years later .PERIOD 
We're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure .PERIOD 
And we're entering the era of personalized oncology ,COMMA the ability to leverage all of this data together ,COMMA analyze the tumor and come up with a real ,COMMA specific cocktail for the individual patient .PERIOD 
So I've studied a lot about stem cells -DASH -DASH embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .PERIOD 
We also have adult stem cells throughout our body .PERIOD 
We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .PERIOD 
We've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about <NUM> years to approach a whole range of topics ,COMMA particularly in cardiovascular disease .PERIOD 
We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack ,COMMA we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .PERIOD 
I invented a device called the MarrowMiner ,COMMA a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow .PERIOD 
It's now been FDA approved ,COMMA and it'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .PERIOD 
Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient's body and removing the patient's bone marrow ,COMMA instead of with <NUM> punctures ,COMMA with just a single puncture under local anesthesia .PERIOD 
But where is stem cell therapy really going ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you think about it ,COMMA every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo .PERIOD 
We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -DASH -DASH making your own personalized stem cell lines .PERIOD 
And I think they'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells ,COMMA myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future ,COMMA should you need them .PERIOD 
And we're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering ,COMMA and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing -DASH -DASH replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ .PERIOD 
That's where things are going to head -DASH -DASH still very early days .PERIOD 
But I think ,COMMA as integration of exponential technologies ,COMMA this is the example .PERIOD 
So in close ,COMMA as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine ,COMMA we're entering an era of miniaturization ,COMMA decentralization and personalization .PERIOD 
And I think by pulling these things together ,COMMA if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these ,COMMA we're going to empower the patient ,COMMA enable the doctor ,COMMA enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .PERIOD 
Because I know as a doctor ,COMMA if someone comes to me with Stage I disease ,COMMA I'm thrilled -DASH -DASH we can often cure them .PERIOD 
But often it's too late and it's Stage III or IV cancer ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
So by leveraging these technologies together ,COMMA I think we'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage <NUM> medicine .PERIOD 
And as a cancer doctor ,COMMA I'm looking forward to being out of a job .PERIOD 
Thanks very much .PERIOD 
Host :COLON Thank you .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Take a bow .PERIOD Take a bow .PERIOD 
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually .PERIOD 
The first one is dedicated to Spencer ,COMMA and his grandmother ,COMMA who was shocked by his work .PERIOD 
My poem is called Dirt .PERIOD 
All because of a word I said ,COMMA not even said really ,COMMA only repeated .PERIOD 
But Open ,COMMA she says ,COMMA open up !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
her hand clawing at my head .PERIOD 
I know now her life was hard ;SEMICOLON she lost three children as babies ,COMMA then her husband died too ,COMMA leaving young sons ,COMMA and no money .PERIOD 
She'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet .PERIOD 
But oh ,COMMA her soap !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet ?QUESTIONMARK 
The street she lived on was unpaved ,COMMA her flat ,COMMA two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me .PERIOD 
Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again ?QUESTIONMARK 
She lived to a hundred ,COMMA even then .PERIOD All along it was the sadness ,COMMA the squalor ,COMMA but I never ,COMMA until now loved her again .PERIOD 
When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle .PERIOD 
You have maligned a great woman .PERIOD 
It took some diplomacy .PERIOD 
This is called The Dress .PERIOD 
In those days ,COMMA those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now ,COMMA when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong ,COMMA then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block ,COMMA and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car ,COMMA having worked late again ,COMMA always late ,COMMA and going heavily down to the cellar ,COMMA to the furnace ,COMMA to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -DASH -DASH in those long-ago days ,COMMA women ,COMMA my mother ,COMMA my friends' mothers ,COMMA our neighbors ,COMMA all the women I knew -DASH -DASH wore ,COMMA often much of the day ,COMMA what were called housedresses ,COMMA cheap ,COMMA printed ,COMMA pulpy ,COMMA seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and ,COMMA when you had to go look for a child ,COMMA hang wash on the line ,COMMA or run down to the grocery store on the corner ,COMMA under a coat ,COMMA the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed ,COMMA dangling beneath .PERIOD 
More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -DASH -DASH a ball ,COMMA one would think -DASH -DASH that never came to pass ;SEMICOLON more than the way most women's faces not only were never made up during the day ,COMMA but seemed scraped ,COMMA bleached ,COMMA and ,COMMA with their plucked eyebrows ,COMMA scarily masklike ;SEMICOLON more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding ,COMMA adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access ,COMMA and boys no conception .PERIOD 
Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation :COLON that in your dim kitchen ,COMMA your laundry ,COMMA your bleak concrete yard ,COMMA what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation ;SEMICOLON your real sensual nature ,COMMA veiled in those sexless vestments ,COMMA was utterly your dominion .PERIOD 
In those days ,COMMA one hid much else as well :COLON grown men didn't embrace one another ,COMMA unless someone had died ,COMMA and not always then ;SEMICOLON you shook hands or ,COMMA at a ball game ,COMMA thumped your friend's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection ;SEMICOLON once out of childhood you'd never again know the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek ,COMMA not until mores at last had evolved ,COMMA and you could hug another man ,COMMA then hold on for a moment ,COMMA then even kiss (your fathers bristles white and stiff now) .PERIOD 
What release finally ,COMMA the embrace :COLON though we were wary -DASH -DASH it seemed so audacious -DASH -DASH how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion ,COMMA no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then .PERIOD 
We knew so little in those days ,COMMA as little as now ,COMMA I suppose about healing those hurts :COLON even the women ,COMMA in their best dresses ,COMMA with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices ,COMMA even in lipstick and mascara ,COMMA their hair aflow ,COMMA could only stand wringing their hands ,COMMA begging for peace ,COMMA while father and son ,COMMA like thugs ,COMMA like thieves ,COMMA like Romans ,COMMA simmered and hissed and hated ,COMMA inflicting sorrows that endured ,COMMA the worst anyway ,COMMA through the kiss and embrace ,COMMA bleeding from brother to brother ,COMMA into the generations .PERIOD 
In those days there was still countryside close to the city ,COMMA farms ,COMMA cornfields ,COMMA cows ;SEMICOLON even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .PERIOD 
Or you could go out by yourself even to a half-block-long empty lot ,COMMA into the bushes :COLON like a creature of leaves you'd lurk ,COMMA crouched ,COMMA crawling ,COMMA simplified ,COMMA savage ,COMMA alone ;SEMICOLON already there was wanting to be simpler ,COMMA wanting ,COMMA when they called you ,COMMA never to go back .PERIOD 
This is another longish one ,COMMA about the old and the young .PERIOD

Another ,COMMA different kind of poem of youth and age .PERIOD 
It's called Gas .PERIOD 
Wouldn't it be nice ,COMMA I think ,COMMA when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts ,COMMA just a little ,COMMA and violently blushes .PERIOD 
Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds ,COMMA so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away .PERIOD 
Besides ,COMMA for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence .PERIOD Because not an hour ago ,COMMA while we were on our walk ,COMMA my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking .PERIOD 
And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was <NUM> ,COMMA and a splendid piebald stallion ,COMMA who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that ,COMMA though more hugely of course ,COMMA enormous ,COMMA gleaming ,COMMA resplendent .PERIOD 
And the woman ,COMMA her face abashedly buried in her Elle now ,COMMA reminded me -DASH -DASH I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart .PERIOD

A casual impulse ,COMMA a fancy ,COMMA never thought of until now ,COMMA hardly thought of even now .. .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA more than impulse or fancy ,COMMA the girl knows what she's doing ,COMMA the girl means something ,COMMA the girl means to mean ,COMMA because it occurs to her in that instant ,COMMA that beautiful or not ,COMMA bright yes or no ,COMMA she's not who she is ,COMMA she's not the person she is ,COMMA and the reason ,COMMA she suddenly knows ,COMMA is that there's been so much premeditation where she is ,COMMA so much plotting and planning ,COMMA there's hardly a person where she is ,COMMA or if there is ,COMMA it's not her ,COMMA or not wholly her ,COMMA it's a self inhabited ,COMMA lived in by her ,COMMA and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what's been missing :COLON grace ,COMMA not premeditation but grace ,COMMA a kind of being in the world spontaneously ,COMMA with grace .PERIOD

Thank you .PERIOD 
In my industry ,COMMA we believe that images can change the world .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA we're naive ,COMMA we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .PERIOD 
So let's begin with a group of images .PERIOD 
I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them .PERIOD 
They're best described as iconic :COLON so iconic ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA they're cliches .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they're so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .PERIOD 
But I think we're looking for something more .PERIOD 
We're looking for something more .PERIOD 
We're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues ,COMMA images that transcend borders ,COMMA that transcend religions ,COMMA images that provoke us to step up and do something -DASH -DASH in other words ,COMMA to act .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this image you've all seen .PERIOD 
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .PERIOD 
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -DASH -DASH its smallness ,COMMA its fragility .PERIOD 
Forty years later ,COMMA this group ,COMMA more than most ,COMMA are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .PERIOD 
And at last ,COMMA we appear to be doing something about it .PERIOD 
This destructive power takes many different forms .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo .PERIOD 
These gorillas were murdered ,COMMA some would even say crucified ,COMMA and unsurprisingly ,COMMA they sparked international outrage .PERIOD 
Most recently ,COMMA we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I think what is far worse is man's destructive power over man .PERIOD 
Samuel Pisar ,COMMA an Auschwitz survivor ,COMMA said ,COMMA and I'll quote him ,COMMA The Holocaust teaches us that nature ,COMMA even in its cruelest moments ,COMMA is benign in comparison with man ,COMMA when he loses his moral compass and his reason .PERIOD 
There's another kind of crucifixion .PERIOD 
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact .PERIOD 
The publication of those images ,COMMA as opposed to the images themselves ,COMMA caused a government to change its policies .PERIOD 
Furthermore ,COMMA those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces .PERIOD 
Let's go back a little .PERIOD 
In the 1960s and 1970s ,COMMA the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in ,COMMA day out .PERIOD 
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war :COLON a little girl burned by napalm ,COMMA a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion ,COMMA ignorance ,COMMA and in particular -DASH -DASH I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -DASH -DASH the issue of HIV/AIDS .PERIOD 
In the 1980s ,COMMA the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .PERIOD 
A simple act ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA of the most famous woman in the world ,COMMA the Princess of Wales ,COMMA touching an HIV/AIDS infected baby did a great deal ,COMMA especially in Europe ,COMMA to stop that .PERIOD 
She ,COMMA better than most ,COMMA knew the power of an image .PERIOD 
So when we are confronted by a powerful image ,COMMA we all have a choice :COLON We can look away ,COMMA or we can address the image .PERIOD 
Thankfully ,COMMA when these photos appeared in The Guardian in <NUM> ,COMMA they put a lot of focus and attention and ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts .PERIOD 
Did the images change the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA but they had a major impact .PERIOD 
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other .PERIOD 
We all saw those images after Katrina ,COMMA and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact .PERIOD 
And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November <NUM> .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .PERIOD 
I'll show you one photo here ,COMMA and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work ,COMMA which has never been published ,COMMA called War Is Personal .PERIOD 
But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .PERIOD 
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .PERIOD 
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world ,COMMA there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still ,COMMA much more than the others .PERIOD 
Ansel Adams said ,COMMA and I'm going to disagree with him ,COMMA You don't take a photograph ,COMMA you make it .PERIOD 
In my view ,COMMA it's not the photographer who makes the photo ,COMMA it's you .PERIOD 
We bring to each image our own values ,COMMA our own belief systems ,COMMA and as a result of that ,COMMA the image resonates with us .PERIOD 
My company has <NUM> million images .PERIOD 
I have one image in my office .PERIOD 
Here it is .PERIOD 
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you ,COMMA you'll better understand why ,COMMA and I know that speaking to this audience ,COMMA you'll definitely do something about it .PERIOD 
And thank you to all the photographers .PERIOD 
This is me .PERIOD My name is Ben Saunders .PERIOD 
I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places .PERIOD 
On May 11th last year ,COMMA I stood alone at the North geographic Pole .PERIOD 
More than <NUM> people have climbed Everest .PERIOD 
<NUM> people have stood on the moon .PERIOD 
Including me ,COMMA only four people have skied solo to the North Pole .PERIOD 
And I think the reason for that -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH thank you -DASH -DASH I think the reason for that is that it's -DASH -DASH it's -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA it's as Chris said ,COMMA bonkers .PERIOD 
It's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability .PERIOD 
I skied the equivalent of <NUM> marathons back to back .PERIOD <NUM> miles in <NUM> weeks .PERIOD 
And I was dragging all the food I needed ,COMMA the supplies ,COMMA the equipment ,COMMA sleeping bag ,COMMA one change of underwear -DASH -DASH everything I needed for nearly three months .PERIOD 
What we're going to try and do today ,COMMA in the <NUM> and a bit minutes I've got left ,COMMA is to try and answer three questions .PERIOD The first one is ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK 
The second one is ,COMMA how do you go to the loo at minus <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't want to answer these now .PERIOD I'll come on to them at the end .PERIOD 
It all started back in <NUM> .PERIOD 
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -DASH -DASH enormously experienced chap .PERIOD 
This was like my polar apprenticeship .PERIOD 
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here ,COMMA Severnaya Zemlya ,COMMA to the North Pole .PERIOD 
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole ,COMMA geographic North Pole ,COMMA is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea .PERIOD 
This is about as good as maps get ,COMMA and to reach it you've got to ski literally over the frozen crust ,COMMA the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean .PERIOD 
I'd spoken to all the experts .PERIOD 
I'd read lots of books .PERIOD I studied maps and charts .PERIOD 
But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I'd let myself in for .PERIOD 
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two .PERIOD 
We started running very low on food .PERIOD We were both pretty hungry ,COMMA losing lots of weight .PERIOD 
Some very unusual weather conditions ,COMMA very difficult ice conditions .PERIOD 
We had decidedly low-tech communications .PERIOD 
We couldn't afford a satellite phone ,COMMA so we had HF radio .PERIOD 
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent .PERIOD 
There's a wire dangling down either side .PERIOD 
That was our HF radio antenna .PERIOD 
We had less than two hours two-way communication with the outside world in two months .PERIOD 
Ultimately ,COMMA we ran out of time .PERIOD 
We'd skied <NUM> miles .PERIOD We were just over <NUM> miles left to go to the Pole ,COMMA and we'd run out of time .PERIOD 
We were too late into the summer ;SEMICOLON the ice was starting to melt ;SEMICOLON we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Look boys ,COMMA you've run out of time .PERIOD 
We've got to pick you up .PERIOD 
And I felt that I had failed ,COMMA wholeheartedly .PERIOD 
I was a failure .PERIOD 
The one goal ,COMMA the one dream I'd had for as long as I could remember -DASH -DASH I hadn't even come close .PERIOD 
And skiing along that first trip ,COMMA I had two imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough ,COMMA just to keep my motivation going .PERIOD 
The first one was reaching the Pole itself .PERIOD 
I could see vividly ,COMMA I suppose ,COMMA being filmed out of the door of a helicopter ,COMMA there was ,COMMA kind of ,COMMA rock music playing in the background ,COMMA and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack ,COMMA you know ,COMMA flying in the wind .PERIOD 
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole ,COMMA you know -DASH -DASH ah ,COMMA glorious moment -DASH -DASH the music kind of reaching a crescendo .PERIOD 
The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport ,COMMA and I could see again ,COMMA vividly ,COMMA the camera flashbulbs going off ,COMMA the paparazzi ,COMMA the autograph hunters ,COMMA the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA neither of these things happened .PERIOD 
We didn't get to the Pole ,COMMA and we didn't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR ,COMMA so no one had heard of this expedition .PERIOD 
And I got back to Heathrow .PERIOD My mum was there ;SEMICOLON my brother was there ;SEMICOLON my granddad was there -DASH -DASH had a little Union Jack -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and that was about it .PERIOD I went back to live with my mum .PERIOD 
I was physically exhausted ,COMMA mentally an absolute wreck ,COMMA considered myself a failure .PERIOD 
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition ,COMMA and lying on my mum's sofa ,COMMA day in day out ,COMMA watching daytime TV .PERIOD 
My brother sent me a text message ,COMMA an SMS -DASH -DASH it was a quote from the Simpsons .PERIOD It said ,COMMA You tried your hardest and failed miserably .PERIOD 
The lesson is :COLON don't even try .PERIOD 
Fast forward three years .PERIOD I did eventually get off the sofa ,COMMA and start planning another expedition .PERIOD This time ,COMMA I wanted to go right across ,COMMA on my own this time ,COMMA from Russia ,COMMA at the top of the map ,COMMA to the North Pole ,COMMA where the sort of kink in the middle is ,COMMA and then on to Canada .PERIOD 
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own .PERIOD 
Two Norwegians did it as a team in <NUM> .PERIOD No one's done it solo .PERIOD 
Very famous ,COMMA very accomplished Italian mountaineer ,COMMA Reinhold Messner ,COMMA tried it in <NUM> ,COMMA and he was rescued after a week .PERIOD 
He described this expedition as <NUM> times as dangerous as Everest .PERIOD 
So for some reason ,COMMA this was what I wanted to have a crack at ,COMMA but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece ,COMMA let alone make it across to Canada ,COMMA I had to take a radical approach .PERIOD 
This meant everything from perfecting the sawn-off ,COMMA sub-two-gram toothbrush ,COMMA to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new ,COMMA revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch :COLON <NUM> calories a day .PERIOD 
And the expedition started in February last year .PERIOD 
Big support team .PERIOD We had a film crew ,COMMA a couple of logistics people with us ,COMMA my girlfriend ,COMMA a photographer .PERIOD 
At first it was pretty sensible .PERIOD We flew British Airways to Moscow .PERIOD 
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk ,COMMA on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir ,COMMA spelled K-R-A-S .PERIOD 
The next bit ,COMMA we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga ,COMMA which was the sort of last bit of civilization .PERIOD 
Our cameraman ,COMMA who it turned out was a pretty nervous flyer at the best of times ,COMMA actually asked the pilot ,COMMA before we got on the plane ,COMMA how long this flight would take ,COMMA and the pilot -DASH -DASH Russian pilot -DASH -DASH completely deadpan ,COMMA replied ,COMMA Six hours -DASH -DASH if we live .PERIOD 
We got to Khatanga .PERIOD 
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world ,COMMA but you can see it from there .PERIOD 
It was supposed to be an overnight stay .PERIOD We were stuck there for <NUM> days .PERIOD 
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter ,COMMA so we were stuck .PERIOD We couldn't move .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA morning of day <NUM> ,COMMA we got the all-clear ,COMMA loaded up the helicopters -DASH -DASH two helicopters flying in tandem -DASH -DASH dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .PERIOD 
We had a frantic sort of <NUM> minutes of filming ,COMMA photography ;SEMICOLON while the helicopter was still there ,COMMA I did an interview on the satellite phone ;SEMICOLON and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter ,COMMA wham ,COMMA the door closed ,COMMA and I was alone .PERIOD 
And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice .PERIOD 
All I could think about was running back up to the door ,COMMA banging on the door ,COMMA and saying ,COMMA Look guys ,COMMA I haven't quite thought this through .PERIOD 
To make things worse ,COMMA you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen ;SEMICOLON that's a full moon .PERIOD 
Because we'd been held up in Russia ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides ;SEMICOLON when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea ,COMMA high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen -DASH -DASH the ice is going to start moving around a bit .PERIOD 
I was ,COMMA you can see there ,COMMA pulling two sledges .PERIOD 
Grand total in all ,COMMA <NUM> days of food and fuel ,COMMA <NUM> kilos -DASH -DASH that's almost exactly <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
When the ice was flat or flattish ,COMMA I could just about pull both .PERIOD 
When the ice wasn't flat ,COMMA I didn't have a hope in hell .PERIOD 
I had to pull one ,COMMA leave it ,COMMA and go back and get the other one .PERIOD 
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -DASH -DASH the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean ,COMMA the wind and the tides .PERIOD 
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began .PERIOD 
And it's always drifting .PERIOD The pack ice is always drifting .PERIOD 
I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the <NUM> weeks I was alone last year ,COMMA and I was drifting backwards most of the time .PERIOD 
My record was minus <NUM> miles .PERIOD 
I got up in the morning ,COMMA took the tent down ,COMMA skied north for seven-and-a-half hours ,COMMA put the tent up ,COMMA and I was two and a half miles further back than when I'd started .PERIOD 
I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice .PERIOD 
 :COLON So it's day <NUM> .PERIOD 
I'm lying in the tent ,COMMA getting ready to go .PERIOD 
The weather is just appalling -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA drifted back about five miles in the last -DASH -DASH last night .PERIOD 
Later in the expedition ,COMMA the problem was no longer the ice .PERIOD 
It was a lack of ice -DASH -DASH open water .PERIOD 
I knew this was happening .PERIOD I knew the Artic was warming .PERIOD 
I knew there was more open water .PERIOD And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve .PERIOD 
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry .PERIOD 
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines .PERIOD 
If they come to water ,COMMA they'll climb in ,COMMA swim across it .PERIOD 
So we had a dry suit developed -DASH -DASH I worked with a team in Norway -DASH -DASH based on a sort of survival suit -DASH -DASH I suppose ,COMMA that helicopter pilots would wear -DASH -DASH that I could climb into .PERIOD It would go on over my boots ,COMMA over my mittens ,COMMA it would pull up around my face ,COMMA and seal pretty tightly around my face .PERIOD 
And this meant I could ski over very thin ice ,COMMA and if I fell through ,COMMA it wasn't the end of the world .PERIOD 
It also meant ,COMMA if the worst came to the worst ,COMMA I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me .PERIOD 
Some pretty radical technology ,COMMA a radical approach -DASH -but it worked perfectly .PERIOD 
Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA Shackleton's Endurance expedition -DASH -DASH there was -DASH -DASH one of his crew ,COMMA a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA The explorers of <NUM> ,COMMA if there is anything left to explore ,COMMA will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years .PERIOD This is my pocket wireless telephone ,COMMA Iridium satellite phone .PERIOD 
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket .PERIOD 
And every single day of the <NUM> days I was alone on the ice ,COMMA I was blogging live from my tent ,COMMA sending back a little diary piece ,COMMA sending back information on the distance I'd covered -DASH -DASH the ice conditions ,COMMA the temperature -DASH -DASH and a daily photo .PERIOD 
Remember ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world .PERIOD 
Last year ,COMMA blogging live from an expedition that's been described as <NUM> times as dangerous as Everest .PERIOD 
It wasn't all high-tech .PERIOD This is navigating in what's called a whiteout .PERIOD 
When you get lots of mist ,COMMA low cloud ,COMMA the wind starts blowing the snow up .PERIOD 
You can't see an awful lot .PERIOD You can just see ,COMMA there's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles .PERIOD 
I'd navigate using the direction of the wind .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech .PERIOD 
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May .PERIOD 
It took me <NUM> days to get there from Russia ,COMMA and there is nothing there .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
There isn't even a pole at the Pole .PERIOD There's nothing there ,COMMA purely because it's sea ice .PERIOD It's drifting .PERIOD 
Stick a flag there ,COMMA leave it there ,COMMA pretty soon it will drift off ,COMMA usually towards Canada or Greenland .PERIOD 
I knew this ,COMMA but I was expecting something .PERIOD 
Strange mixture of feelings :COLON it was extremely warm by this stage ,COMMA a lot of open water around ,COMMA and of course ,COMMA elated that I'd got there under my own steam ,COMMA but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada ,COMMA which was still <NUM> miles away ,COMMA were slim at best .PERIOD 
The only proof I've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS ,COMMA the little satellite navigation gadget .PERIOD 
Ninety degrees north -DASH -DASH that is slap bang in the North Pole .PERIOD 
I took a photo of that .PERIOD Sat down on my sledge .PERIOD Did a sort of video diary piece .PERIOD 
Took a few photos .PERIOD I got my satellite phone out .PERIOD 
I warmed the battery up in my armpit .PERIOD 
I dialed my girlfriend .PERIOD I dialed the CEO of my sponsor .PERIOD 
And I got three voicemails .PERIOD 
 :COLON Ninety .PERIOD 
It's a special feeling .PERIOD 
The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet .PERIOD 
I finally got through to my mum .PERIOD She was at the queue of the supermarket .PERIOD 
She started crying .PERIOD She asked me to call her back .PERIOD 
I skied on for a week past the Pole .PERIOD 
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue .PERIOD 
This was the last day I had on the ice .PERIOD 
When I spoke to the -DASH -DASH my project management team ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA Ben ,COMMA conditions are getting too dangerous .PERIOD 
We'd like to pick you up .PERIOD 
Ben ,COMMA could you please look for an airstrip ?QUESTIONMARK 
This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call .PERIOD 
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before .PERIOD Tony ,COMMA the expedition manager ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Look Ben ,COMMA you've got to find <NUM> meters of flat ,COMMA thick safe ice .PERIOD 
The only bit of ice I could find -DASH -DASH it took me <NUM> hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -DASH -DASH was exactly <NUM> meters .PERIOD I could measure it with my skis .PERIOD 
I didn't tell Tony that .PERIOD I didn't tell the pilots that .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA it'll have to do .PERIOD 
 :COLON Oh ,COMMA oh ,COMMA oh ,COMMA oh ,COMMA oh ,COMMA oh .PERIOD 
It just about worked .PERIOD A pretty dramatic landing -DASH -DASH the plane actually passed over four times ,COMMA and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all .PERIOD 
The pilot ,COMMA I knew ,COMMA was called Troy .PERIOD I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy .PERIOD 
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -DASH -DASH a pretty emotional moment .PERIOD 
So I thought ,COMMA I've got to compose myself for Troy .PERIOD 
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type .PERIOD 
The plane taxied up to where I was standing .PERIOD 
The door opened .PERIOD This guy jumped out .PERIOD He's about that tall .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Hi ,COMMA my name is Troy .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica .PERIOD 
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper .PERIOD 
They were the least macho people I've ever met ,COMMA but they made my day .PERIOD 
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice ;SEMICOLON we took a few photos .PERIOD He climbed up the ladder .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Just -DASH -DASH just get in the back .PERIOD 
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front ,COMMA and I climbed in the back .PERIOD 
Taxied up and down the runway a few times ,COMMA just to flatten it out a bit ,COMMA and he said ,COMMA Right ,COMMA I'm going to -DASH -DASH I'm going to give it a go .PERIOD And he -DASH -DASH I've now learned that this is standard practice ,COMMA but it had me worried at the time .PERIOD 
He put his hand on the throttle .PERIOD 
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit .PERIOD 
It's that little bar there .PERIOD He put his hand on the throttle .PERIOD 
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA God ,COMMA here we go .PERIOD We're ,COMMA we're -DASH -DASH this is all or nothing .PERIOD 
Rammed it forwards .PERIOD Bounced down the runway .PERIOD Just took off .PERIOD 
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway ,COMMA banking .PERIOD I could see into the cockpit ,COMMA Troy battling the controls ,COMMA and he just took one hand off ,COMMA reached back ,COMMA flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit ,COMMA and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the wall .PERIOD 
And only from the air did I see the big picture .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA when you're on the ice ,COMMA you only ever see one obstacle at a time ,COMMA whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water .PERIOD 
This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it really was starting to break up .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense .PERIOD 
I'm not skiing along drawing maps ;SEMICOLON everyone knows where the North Pole is .PERIOD 
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base .PERIOD There's an airstrip .PERIOD 
There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA this is about exploring human limits ,COMMA about exploring the limits of physiology ,COMMA of psychology and of technology .PERIOD They're the things that excite me .PERIOD 
And it's also about potential ,COMMA on a personal level .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA for me ,COMMA is a chance to explore the limits -DASH -DASH really push the limits of my own potential ,COMMA see how far they stretch .PERIOD 
And on a wider scale ,COMMA it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential ,COMMA just doing three or four or five percent of what they're truly capable of .PERIOD So ,COMMA on a wider scale ,COMMA I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential ,COMMA and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet .PERIOD 
That's as close as I can come to summing that up .PERIOD 
The next question is ,COMMA how do you answer the call of nature at minus <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
The answer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA to which is a trade secret -DASH -DASH and the last question ,COMMA what's next ?QUESTIONMARK As quickly as possible ,COMMA if I have a minute left at the end ,COMMA I'll go into more detail .PERIOD 
What's next :COLON Antarctica .PERIOD 
It's the coldest ,COMMA highest ,COMMA windiest and driest continent on Earth .PERIOD 
Late <NUM> ,COMMA early <NUM> ,COMMA there was a race to be the first to the South Pole :COLON the heart of the Antarctic continent .PERIOD 
If you include the coastal ice shelves ,COMMA you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf -DASH -DASH it's the big one down here -DASH -DASH the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France .PERIOD 
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen ,COMMA the Norwegian -DASH -DASH Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -DASH -DASH and Scott ,COMMA the British guy ,COMMA Captain Scott .PERIOD 
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs ,COMMA all of which went wrong ,COMMA and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot .PERIOD 
They got to the Pole late January <NUM> to find a Norwegian flag already there .PERIOD 
There was a tent ,COMMA a letter to the Norwegian king .PERIOD 
Since then ,COMMA no one has ever skied -DASH -DASH this was <NUM> years ago -DASH -DASH since then ,COMMA no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back .PERIOD 
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -DASH -DASH no one has ever made a return journey .PERIOD So that's the plan .PERIOD 
Two of us are doing it .PERIOD 
That's pretty much it .PERIOD 
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit ,COMMA is -DASH -DASH is ,COMMA I have a -DASH -DASH and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten -DASH -DASH but I have a -DASH -DASH I have a school report .PERIOD I was <NUM> years old ,COMMA and it's framed above my desk at home .PERIOD It says ,COMMA Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile .PERIOD 
I think if I've learned anything ,COMMA it's this :COLON that no one else is the authority on your potential .PERIOD 
You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of .PERIOD 
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA that's my story .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I was in the hospital for a long time .PERIOD 
And a few years after I left ,COMMA I went back ,COMMA and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -DASH -DASH said ,COMMA Dan ,COMMA I have a fantastic new treatment for you .PERIOD 
I was very excited .PERIOD I walked with him to his office .PERIOD 
And he explained to me that ,COMMA when I shave ,COMMA I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is ,COMMA but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair ,COMMA and this creates lack of symmetry .PERIOD 
And what's the brilliant idea he had ?QUESTIONMARK 
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .PERIOD 
It sounded interesting .PERIOD He asked me to go and shave .PERIOD 
Let me tell you ,COMMA this was a strange way to shave ,COMMA because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life -DASH -DASH because I had to keep the width the same .PERIOD 
When I got back to his office ,COMMA I wasn't really sure .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Can I see some evidence for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots -DASH -DASH not very informative .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would happen then ?QUESTIONMARK 
Oh ,COMMA don't worry about it ,COMMA he said .PERIOD 
We have lasers ;SEMICOLON we can whiten it out .PERIOD 
But I was still concerned ,COMMA so I said ,COMMA You know what ,COMMA I'm not going to do it .PERIOD 
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .PERIOD 
This is coming from a Jewish guy ,COMMA all right ,COMMA so that means a lot .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Dan ,COMMA what's wrong with you ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ?QUESTIONMARK 
None of those happened .PERIOD 
And this was very surprising to me ,COMMA because I've gone through many treatments -DASH -DASH there were many treatments I decided not to do -DASH -DASH and I never got this guilt trip to this extent .PERIOD 
But I decided not to have this treatment .PERIOD 
And I went to his deputy and asked him ,COMMA What was going on ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already ,COMMA and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing .PERIOD 
Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA that's what he seems like .PERIOD 
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .PERIOD 
A few years ago ,COMMA I was running some of my own experiments in the lab .PERIOD 
And when we run experiments ,COMMA we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .PERIOD 
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high ,COMMA another group that I thought their performance would be very low ,COMMA and when I got the results ,COMMA that's what we got -DASH -DASH I was very happy -DASH -DASH aside from one person .PERIOD 
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .PERIOD 
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .PERIOD 
Fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK I thought .PERIOD Let's throw him out .PERIOD 
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ?QUESTIONMARK 
But a couple of days later ,COMMA we thought about it with my students ,COMMA and we said ,COMMA What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would we have thrown him out then ?QUESTIONMARK 
We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all ,COMMA and if we did look at the data ,COMMA we'd probably have said ,COMMA Fantastic !EXCLAMATIONMARK What a smart guy who is performing this low ,COMMA because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower ,COMMA giving us even stronger statistical results than we could .PERIOD 
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .PERIOD 
But you know ,COMMA these stories ,COMMA and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest ,COMMA basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .PERIOD 
The first one is that in life we encounter many people who ,COMMA in some way or another ,COMMA try to tattoo our faces .PERIOD 
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .PERIOD 
Maybe we don't recognize it every time ,COMMA but we understand that it happens .PERIOD 
The most difficult thing ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .PERIOD 
Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us .PERIOD 
When I was doing these experiments ,COMMA in my mind ,COMMA I was helping science .PERIOD 
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .PERIOD 
I wasn't doing something bad .PERIOD 
But this was not the case .PERIOD 
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .PERIOD 
And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us ,COMMA and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it ,COMMA but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors ,COMMA because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances .PERIOD 
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .PERIOD 
The positive perspective ,COMMA I think ,COMMA of all of this is that ,COMMA if we do understand when we go wrong ,COMMA if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail ,COMMA we can actually hope to fix things .PERIOD 
And that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is the hope .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
People do stupid things .PERIOD 
That's what spreads HIV .PERIOD 
This was a headline in a U.K .PERIOD newspaper ,COMMA The Guardian ,COMMA not that long ago .PERIOD 
I'm curious ,COMMA show of hands ,COMMA who agrees with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA one or two brave souls .PERIOD 
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true .PERIOD 
People do get HIV because they do stupid things ,COMMA but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA rational is the dominant paradigm in public health ,COMMA and if you put your public health nerd glasses on ,COMMA you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them ,COMMA if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information ,COMMA and a little bit of motivation ,COMMA people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives .PERIOD 
Wonderful .PERIOD 
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV ,COMMA and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality ,COMMA and if you were at TED '<NUM> it's about coffee prices .. .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA HIV's about sex and drugs ,COMMA and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational ,COMMA they are erections and addiction .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let's start with what's rational for an addict .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine ,COMMA Frankie .PERIOD 
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection .PERIOD 
It was someone's birthday ,COMMA and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail ,COMMA and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues .PERIOD 
So he injects the first guy ,COMMA and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt ,COMMA and he injects the next guy .PERIOD 
And Frankie says ,COMMA I'm number <NUM> in line ,COMMA and I can see the needle coming down towards me ,COMMA and there is blood all over the place .PERIOD 
It's getting blunter and blunter .PERIOD 
And a small part of my brain is thinking ,COMMA 'That is so gross and really dangerous ,COMMA ' but most of my brain is thinking ,COMMA 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me .PERIOD 
Please let there be some left.' And then ,COMMA telling me this story ,COMMA Frankie said ,COMMA You know .. .PERIOD God ,COMMA drugs really make you stupid .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can't fault him for accuracy .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA actually ,COMMA Frankie ,COMMA at that time ,COMMA was a heroin addict and he was in jail .PERIOD 
And if there's one place you really want to get high ,COMMA it's when you're in jail .PERIOD 
But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes ,COMMA so let's look at some data .PERIOD 
We talked to <NUM> drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia ,COMMA and we said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA do you know how you get HIV ?QUESTIONMARK 
Oh yeah ,COMMA by sharing needles .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA nearly <NUM> percent .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA by sharing needles .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Oh yeah .PERIOD Hundred percent .PERIOD 
We're smackheads ;SEMICOLON we know where to get clean needles .PERIOD 
So are you carrying a needle ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're actually interviewing people on the street ,COMMA in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs .PERIOD 
Are you carrying clean needles ?QUESTIONMARK 
One in four ,COMMA maximum .PERIOD 
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in <NUM> ,COMMA and the other nine in <NUM> are sharing .PERIOD 
So you've got this massive mismatch ;SEMICOLON everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV ,COMMA but they're all sharing anyway .PERIOD 
We asked that to a junkie and they're like ,COMMA Are you nuts ?QUESTIONMARK 
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with .PERIOD 
There's just kind of an ick factor there .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA no .PERIOD We share needles because we don't want to go to jail .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in Indonesia at this time ,COMMA if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up ,COMMA they could put you into jail .PERIOD 
And that changes the equation slightly ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now ,COMMA or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me <NUM> years from now ,COMMA or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow .PERIOD 
And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV ,COMMA they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view .PERIOD 
This is a really easy problem .PERIOD 
For once ,COMMA your incentives are aligned .PERIOD 
We've got what's rational for public health .PERIOD 
You want people to use clean needles -DASH -DASH and junkies want to use clean needles .PERIOD 
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known ,COMMA bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher .PERIOD 
And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program ,COMMA and other countries followed suit :COLON Australia ,COMMA The Netherlands and few others .PERIOD 
And in all of those countries ,COMMA you can see ,COMMA not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA places that didn't do this -DASH -DASH New York City for example ,COMMA Moscow ,COMMA Jakarta -DASH -DASH we're talking ,COMMA at its peak ,COMMA one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies .PERIOD 
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if she didn't invest in effective prevention ,COMMA she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on ,COMMA and obviously those are much higher .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data ,COMMA it seems like a no-brainer ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
But in this country ,COMMA where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens ,COMMA we've taken a very different approach .PERIOD 
So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -DASH -DASH endlessly reviewing the data .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States ,COMMA and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -DASH -DASH quite a lot of them .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective -DASH -DASH you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up ,COMMA but no -DASH -DASH that's the whole slide .PERIOD 
There is nothing on the other side .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA completely irrational ,COMMA you would think .PERIOD 
Except that ,COMMA wait a minute ,COMMA politicians are rational ,COMMA too ,COMMA and they're responding to what they think the voters want .PERIOD 
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .PERIOD 
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .PERIOD 
Now let's talk about sex .PERIOD 
Are we any more rational about sex ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church ,COMMA who think somehow that if you give out condoms ,COMMA everyone's going to run out and have sex .PERIOD 
I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online ,COMMA but if you do ,COMMA I've got news for you Benedict -DASH -DASH I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid .PERIOD 
It's not that easy !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Here ,COMMA maybe you'll have better luck .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA seriously ,COMMA HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids .PERIOD 
And what we've got is a very ,COMMA very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected ,COMMA then you start making antibodies ,COMMA and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -DASH -DASH <NUM> or <NUM> years -DASH -DASH you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection .PERIOD 
But basically ,COMMA nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS ,COMMA and by that stage ,COMMA you're not looking great ,COMMA you're not feeling great ,COMMA you're not having that much sex .PERIOD 
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups ,COMMA and that's considered stigmatizing .PERIOD 
The truth is that <NUM> years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time .PERIOD 
And those groups are ,COMMA globally ,COMMA people who sell sex and their more regular partners .PERIOD 
They are gay men on the party scene who have ,COMMA on average ,COMMA three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .PERIOD 
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy ,COMMA and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .PERIOD 
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .PERIOD 
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa .PERIOD 
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven ,COMMA and one in three of all adults ,COMMA are infected with HIV .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the rest of the world ,COMMA we've got basically nothing going on in the general population -DASH -DASH very ,COMMA very low levels -DASH -DASH but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk :COLON drug injectors ,COMMA sex workers and gay men .PERIOD 
And you'll note ,COMMA that's the local data from Los Angeles :COLON <NUM> percent prevalence among gay men .PERIOD 
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person .PERIOD 
In most of the world ,COMMA these few prevention failures notwithstanding ,COMMA we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex :COLON condom use rates are between <NUM> and <NUM> percent in commercial sex in most countries .PERIOD 
What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI .PERIOD 
No one wants it .PERIOD 
So essentially ,COMMA you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex .PERIOD 
But in intimate relations it's much more difficult because ,COMMA with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things ,COMMA we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy ,COMMA and nothing is quite so unromantic as the ,COMMA My condom or yours ,COMMA darling ?QUESTIONMARK question .PERIOD 
So in the face of that ,COMMA you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms .PERIOD 
This ,COMMA for example ,COMMA this gentleman is called Joseph .PERIOD 
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now ,COMMA but he is a reminder in the population ,COMMA of why you might want to be using condoms .PERIOD 
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex ,COMMA perhaps .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA funnily enough ,COMMA this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment .PERIOD 
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .PERIOD 
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what we've got -DASH -DASH some people say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA it doesn't matter very much because ,COMMA actually ,COMMA treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if you look at the viremia thing again ,COMMA if you do start treatment when you're sick ,COMMA well ,COMMA what happens ?QUESTIONMARK Your viral load comes down .PERIOD 
But compared to what ?QUESTIONMARK What happens if you're not on treatment ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA you die ,COMMA so your viral load goes to zero .PERIOD 
And all of this green stuff here ,COMMA including the spikes -DASH -DASH which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy ,COMMA or you ran out of drugs ,COMMA or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs ,COMMA or because you've started to get resistance ,COMMA or whatever -DASH -DASH all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there ,COMMA except for treatment .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA am I saying ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA great prevention strategy .PERIOD 
Let's just stop treating people .PERIOD 
Of course not ,COMMA of course not .PERIOD 
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .PERIOD 
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need .PERIOD 
That's simply not necessarily true ,COMMA and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on <NUM> years now .PERIOD 
And what we've seen is that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA condom use rates ,COMMA which were very ,COMMA very high -DASH -DASH the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV ,COMMA with extremely little help from public health nerds ,COMMA I would say -DASH -DASH that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really :COLON One is the assumption of ,COMMA Oh well ,COMMA if he's infected ,COMMA he's probably on meds ,COMMA and his viral load's going to be low ,COMMA so I'm pretty safe .PERIOD 
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you ,COMMA and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .PERIOD 
And that's boring ,COMMA but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex ,COMMA no matter how drunk you are ,COMMA no matter how many poppers you've taken ,COMMA whatever ?QUESTIONMARK 
If we look at the data ,COMMA we can see that the answer to that question is ,COMMA mmm .PERIOD 
So these are data from Scotland .PERIOD 
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program .PERIOD 
Then it came way down .PERIOD 
And both in heterosexuals -DASH -DASH mostly in commercial sex -DASH -DASH and in drug users ,COMMA you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins ,COMMA and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier .PERIOD 
But in gay men ,COMMA you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .PERIOD 
This is of new infections .PERIOD 
What does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -DASH -DASH more people living longer ,COMMA healthier lives ,COMMA more likely to be getting laid with HIV -DASH -DASH is outweighing the effects of lower viral load ,COMMA and that's a very worrisome thing .PERIOD 
What does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .PERIOD 
Is that what's happening ?QUESTIONMARK 
No ,COMMA and I call it the compassion conundrum .PERIOD 
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days ,COMMA and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers ,COMMA unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies .PERIOD 
But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims ,COMMA we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives .PERIOD 
It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view .PERIOD 
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines .PERIOD 
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta ;SEMICOLON she's a chick with a dick .PERIOD 
Why does she do that job ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA of course ,COMMA because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory ,COMMA all would be well .PERIOD 
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia :COLON on average ,COMMA <NUM> cents .PERIOD 
It varies a bit province to province .PERIOD 
I do speak to sex workers ,COMMA <NUM> of them for this particular slide ,COMMA and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .PERIOD 
So it's not a great job ,COMMA but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA Ines .PERIOD 
Ines :COLON So why is prevalence still rising ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's all politics .PERIOD 
When you get to politics ,COMMA nothing makes sense .PERIOD 
Elizabeth Pisani :COLON When you get to politics ,COMMA nothing makes sense .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA from the point of view of a sex worker ,COMMA politicians are making no sense .PERIOD 
From the point of view of a public health nerd ,COMMA junkies are doing dumb things .PERIOD 
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .PERIOD 
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another ,COMMA so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician ,COMMA and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want .PERIOD 
But here's the thing :COLON we are the voters .PERIOD 
We're not all of them ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but TED is a community of opinion leaders .PERIOD 
And everyone who's in this room ,COMMA and everyone who's watching this out there on the web ,COMMA I think ,COMMA has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense .PERIOD 
It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there ,COMMA but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I was covering the war in Afghanistan ,COMMA and I witnessed ,COMMA as a reporter for Al Jazeera ,COMMA the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA two years later ,COMMA I covered another war -DASH -DASH the war in Iraq .PERIOD 
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq .PERIOD 
And the war ended with a regime change ,COMMA like the one in Afghanistan .PERIOD 
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship ,COMMA an authoritarian regime ,COMMA that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation ,COMMA within the people themselves .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world .PERIOD 
For decades ,COMMA we have lived under authoritarian regimes -DASH -DASH in the Arab world ,COMMA in the Middle East .PERIOD 
These regimes created something within us during this period .PERIOD 
I'm <NUM> years old right now .PERIOD 
For the last <NUM> years ,COMMA I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -DASH -DASH old ,COMMA aged ,COMMA authoritarian ,COMMA corrupt situations -DASH -DASH regimes that we have seen around us .PERIOD 
And for a moment I was wondering ,COMMA are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground ,COMMA a change that does not come through foreign intervention ,COMMA through the misery of occupation ,COMMA through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes ?QUESTIONMARK 
The Iraqis :COLON yes ,COMMA they got rid of Saddam Hussein ,COMMA but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad ,COMMA they felt that their dignity had suffered .PERIOD 
And this is why they revolted .PERIOD 
This is why they did not accept .PERIOD 
And actually other regimes ,COMMA they told their citizens ,COMMA Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would you like to see destruction ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the people thought for themselves ,COMMA Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in ,COMMA instead of having the second scenario .PERIOD 
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen .PERIOD 
For <NUM> years ,COMMA unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction ,COMMA images of killing ,COMMA of sectarian conflicts ,COMMA images of violence ,COMMA emerging from a magnificent piece of land ,COMMA a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years .PERIOD 
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived .PERIOD 
A new generation ,COMMA well-educated ,COMMA connected ,COMMA inspired by universal values and a global understanding ,COMMA has created a new reality for us .PERIOD 
We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams :COLON these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world ,COMMA who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets .PERIOD 
Nothing happened .PERIOD No violence .PERIOD Nothing .PERIOD 
Just step out of your house ,COMMA raise your voice and say ,COMMA We would like to see the end of the regime .PERIOD 
This is what happened in Tunisia .PERIOD 
Over a few days ,COMMA the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies ,COMMA billions of dollars in maintaining ,COMMA trying to maintain ,COMMA its prisons ,COMMA collapsed ,COMMA disappeared ,COMMA because of the voices of the public .PERIOD 
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices ,COMMA they tried to kill .PERIOD 
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people .PERIOD 
They found something called Twitter .PERIOD 
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA These kids are misled .PERIOD 
Therefore ,COMMA they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them ,COMMA bring them back home .PERIOD 
Bring these kids home because they are misled .PERIOD 
But yes ,COMMA these youth who have been inspired by universal values ,COMMA who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it -DASH -DASH not using violence ,COMMA not trying to create chaos -DASH -DASH these young people ,COMMA they did not go home .PERIOD 
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them .PERIOD 
We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years ,COMMA and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there .PERIOD 
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -DASH -DASH people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority .PERIOD 
And then we took that decision :COLON We are unrolling the news .PERIOD 
We are going to spread the message .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA some of these young people are connected to the Internet ,COMMA but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little ,COMMA is very small ,COMMA because of many problems that we are suffering from .PERIOD 
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it] .PERIOD 
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -DASH -DASH and internationally ,COMMA globally ,COMMA through our English channel .PERIOD 
And then people started to feel that there's something new happening .PERIOD 
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave .PERIOD 
And then Egypt started ,COMMA and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave .PERIOD 
And now Libya as you see it .PERIOD 
And then you have Yemen .PERIOD 
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of ,COMMA How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want to tell you something ,COMMA that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset .PERIOD 
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from .PERIOD 
And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change ,COMMA before we thought ,COMMA and governments told us -DASH -DASH and even sometimes it was true -DASH -DASH that change was imposed on us ,COMMA and people rejected that ,COMMA because they thought that it is alien to their culture .PERIOD 
Always ,COMMA we believed that change will spring from within ,COMMA that change should be a reconciliation with culture ,COMMA cultural diversity ,COMMA with our faith in our tradition and in our history ,COMMA but at the same time ,COMMA open to universal values ,COMMA connected with the world ,COMMA tolerant to the outside .PERIOD 
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world .PERIOD 
This is the right moment ,COMMA and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region .PERIOD 
How did the elite deal with that -DASH -DASH the so-called political elite ?QUESTIONMARK 
In front of Facebook ,COMMA they brought the camels in Tahrir Square .PERIOD 
In front of Al Jazeera ,COMMA they started creating tribalism .PERIOD 
And then when they failed ,COMMA they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world .PERIOD 
They started telling the West ,COMMA Be aware of Al-Qaeda .PERIOD 
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories .PERIOD 
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras .PERIOD 
Fortunately ,COMMA people right now cannot be deceived .PERIOD 
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception .PERIOD 
They could not ,COMMA and they cannot ,COMMA imagine how they could really deal with this reality .PERIOD 
They have lost .PERIOD 
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution .PERIOD 
We do not create revolutions .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA when something of that magnitude happens ,COMMA we are at the center of the coverage .PERIOD 
We were banned from Egypt ,COMMA and our correspondents ,COMMA some of them were arrested .PERIOD 
But most of our camera people and our journalists ,COMMA they went underground in Egypt -DASH -DASH voluntarily -DASH -DASH to report what happened in Tahrir Square .PERIOD 
For <NUM> days ,COMMA our cameras were broadcasting ,COMMA live ,COMMA the voices of the people in Tahrir Square .PERIOD 
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -DASH -DASH ordinary person who I don't know -DASH -DASH from Tahrir Square .PERIOD 
He told me ,COMMA We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras .PERIOD 
If you switch off the cameras tonight ,COMMA there will be a genocide .PERIOD 
You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square .PERIOD 
So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world .PERIOD 
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran ,COMMA of [the] Mosaddeq revolution .PERIOD 
The stability and security of authoritarian regimes cannot create but terrorism and violence and destruction .PERIOD 
Let us accept the choice of the people .PERIOD 
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future .PERIOD 
The future should be ruled by people themselves ,COMMA even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us .PERIOD 
But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world ,COMMA for the West and the East ,COMMA to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world ,COMMA rather than the images of violence and terrorism .PERIOD 
Let us support these people .PERIOD 
Let us stand for them .PERIOD 
And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change ,COMMA and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance .PERIOD 
The future has arrived ,COMMA and the future is now .PERIOD 
I thank you very much .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD

Thank you for coming here .PERIOD 
How would you characterize the historical significance of what's happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
Wadah Khanfar :COLON Actually ,COMMA this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered .PERIOD 
We have covered many wars .PERIOD

But this is a story -DASH -DASH it is a great story ;SEMICOLON it is beautiful .PERIOD 
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident .PERIOD 
You are witnessing change in history .PERIOD 
You are witnessing the birth of a new era .PERIOD 
And this is what the story's all about .PERIOD 
There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical ,COMMA or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos .PERIOD 
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now ,COMMA that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly ?QUESTIONMARK 
And people actually ,COMMA after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime ,COMMA the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils ,COMMA they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy ,COMMA but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational ,COMMA not to go out of order .PERIOD 
At this moment in time ,COMMA the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -DASH -DASH including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes .PERIOD 
We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way .PERIOD 
What should people here at TED ,COMMA here in the West ,COMMA do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what's happening here ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -DASH -DASH that people care ,COMMA people care about this great transformation .PERIOD

I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you .PERIOD 
This instrument came up in those pictures .PERIOD It's called the mouth bow .PERIOD 
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world ,COMMA and still played in the Southern mountains .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this .PERIOD 
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up .PERIOD 
It sounds something like this .PERIOD

Well ,COMMA it was <NUM> ,COMMA I guess it was .PERIOD 
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville ,COMMA Texas ,COMMA where I grew up in the early part of my life .PERIOD 
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store .PERIOD 
My mom was driving ;SEMICOLON my brother and I were in the back seat .PERIOD 
We were really mad at my mom .PERIOD We looked out the window .PERIOD 
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields .PERIOD

And ,COMMA buddy ,COMMA that made us mad .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA my mom didn't put up with much either ,COMMA and she was driving ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA You boys !EXCLAMATIONMARK You think you can have anything you want .PERIOD

She pulled the car over ;SEMICOLON she said ,COMMA Get out of the car .PERIOD 
My brother and I stepped out of the car .PERIOD

There were about a hundred black folks out there picking .PERIOD

Of course ,COMMA we were just eight and <NUM> .PERIOD 
She said ,COMMA Would you put them to work ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman :COLON put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -DASH -DASH it's hot .PERIOD 
So he gave us each a cotton sack ,COMMA about <NUM> feet long ,COMMA about that big around ,COMMA and we started picking .PERIOD

And Mom was just sitting by the car like this .PERIOD 
She wasn't going to give up .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the foreman could see he was in over his head ,COMMA I guess .PERIOD 
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice .PERIOD 
He just sang :COLON Well ,COMMA there's a long white robe in heaven ,COMMA I know .PERIOD 
Don't want it to leave me behind .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA there's a long white robe in heaven ,COMMA I know .PERIOD

Finally ,COMMA by the end of the day ,COMMA we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton .PERIOD 
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar ,COMMA but my mother would never let us cash it .PERIOD 
I'm <NUM> ;SEMICOLON still have the check .PERIOD 
But if you have children ,COMMA you know it doesn't often work that way .PERIOD

After the -DASH -DASH she was glad to have a story about herself ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but after the concert she came up and she said ,COMMA David ,COMMA I've got to tell you something .PERIOD 
I set that whole thing up .PERIOD

Let's try .PERIOD Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD 
Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD 
Good news :COLON Chariot's coming .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this is the steel guitar .PERIOD It's an American-made instrument .PERIOD 
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers ,COMMA who later on made the Dobro ,COMMA which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for -DASH -DASH where the sound comes from .PERIOD 
It's usually played flat on your lap .PERIOD 
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s ,COMMA before they had electric guitars ,COMMA trying to make a loud guitar .PERIOD 
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck ,COMMA just like that -DASH -DASH a nice Merlot works very well .PERIOD 
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect .PERIOD 
Break it off ,COMMA put it on your finger ,COMMA and slide into the notes .PERIOD 
This instrument pretty much saved my life .PERIOD 
Fifteen years ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA I guess ,COMMA this year ,COMMA my wife and I lost our daughter ,COMMA Sarah Jane ,COMMA in a car accident ,COMMA and it was the most -DASH -DASH it almost took me out -DASH -DASH it almost took me out of this world .PERIOD 
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief ,COMMA just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in .PERIOD 
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive .PERIOD 
I had to sit down and make lists ,COMMA because I was ready to go ;SEMICOLON I was ready to check out of this world .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA at the top of the list ,COMMA of course ,COMMA were Jenny ,COMMA and my son ,COMMA Zeb ,COMMA my parents -DASH -DASH I didn't want to hurt them .PERIOD 
But then ,COMMA when I thought about it beyond that ,COMMA it was very simple things .PERIOD 
I didn't care about -DASH -DASH I had a radio show ,COMMA I have a radio show on public radio ,COMMA Riverwalk ,COMMA I didn't care about that .PERIOD I didn't care about awards or money or anything .PERIOD 
Nothing .PERIOD Nothing .PERIOD 
On the list it would be stuff like ,COMMA seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring ,COMMA the smell of new-mown hay ,COMMA catching a wave and bodysurfing ,COMMA the touch of a baby's hand ,COMMA the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar ,COMMA listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon .PERIOD 
And for me ,COMMA the sound of a steel guitar ,COMMA because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things .PERIOD 
And I would sit around with it ,COMMA and I didn't know how to play it ,COMMA but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play .PERIOD 
And it was the only instrument that ,COMMA of all the ones that I play ,COMMA that would really make that connection .PERIOD 
This is a song that came out of that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I hear you're having trouble .PERIOD 
Lord ,COMMA I hate to hear that news .PERIOD 
If you want to talk about it ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I will listen to you through .PERIOD 
Words no longer say it ;SEMICOLON let me tell you what I always do .PERIOD 
People say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA snap out of it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Oh yeah ,COMMA that's easier said than done .PERIOD 
While you can hardly move ,COMMA they're running around having all kinds of fun .PERIOD 
Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes ,COMMA but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get .PERIOD 
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose .PERIOD 
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues .PERIOD 
Open up now .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA I think I've got time to tell you about this .PERIOD My dad was an inventor .PERIOD 
We moved to California when Sputnik went up ,COMMA in <NUM> .PERIOD 
And he was working on gyroscopes ;SEMICOLON he has a number of patents for that kind of thing .PERIOD 
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney .PERIOD 
John went on ,COMMA and Michael did too ,COMMA to become some of the inventors of computer animation .PERIOD 
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer .PERIOD 
This was <NUM> ,COMMA I was a little 10-year-old kid ;SEMICOLON I didn't know what that was .PERIOD But he took me down to see one ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what they were making .PERIOD It was like a library ,COMMA just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see ,COMMA just floors and floors of these things ,COMMA and one of the engineers said ,COMMA some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA damn ,COMMA those are going to be some big pants !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So that Christmas -DASH -DASH maybe I've got time for this -DASH -DASH that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ;SEMICOLON so did Michael .PERIOD 
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney ,COMMA the inventor of the cotton gin .PERIOD 
So we looked in that -DASH -DASH this was a commercial chemistry set .PERIOD 
Man ,COMMA we were only <NUM> ,COMMA but we knew that made gunpowder .PERIOD 
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew ,COMMA it flared up .PERIOD Ah ,COMMA it was great .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon .PERIOD 
So we went over into Michael's garage -DASH -DASH his dad had all kinds of stuff ,COMMA and we put a pipe in the vice there ,COMMA and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe ,COMMA drilled a hole in the back of the pipe ,COMMA took some of our firecrackers ,COMMA pulled out the fuses ,COMMA tied them together ,COMMA put them in the back there ,COMMA and -DASH -DASH down in that hole -DASH -DASH and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top ,COMMA in the garage .PERIOD 
We weren't stupid :COLON we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .PERIOD 
We stood back ,COMMA we lit that thing ,COMMA and they flew out of there -DASH -DASH they went through that plywood like it was paper .PERIOD 
Through the garage .PERIOD 
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen .PERIOD 
That was Pacific Palisades ;SEMICOLON it probably is still there ,COMMA back there .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA my brother heard that we had made gunpowder .PERIOD 
He and his buddies ,COMMA they were older ,COMMA and they were pretty mean .PERIOD 
They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them .PERIOD 
We said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what are you going to do with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
They said ,COMMA we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel .PERIOD 
Sure .PERIOD We'll make you a big batch .PERIOD 
So we made them a big batch ,COMMA and it was in my -DASH -DASH now ,COMMA we'd just moved here .PERIOD We'd just moved to California .PERIOD 
Mom had redone the kitchen ;SEMICOLON Mom was gone that day .PERIOD We had a pie tin .PERIOD 
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down .PERIOD 
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA hey ,COMMA it's melting .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA the sulfur's melting .PERIOD 
No problem .PERIOD Yeah ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
It just flared up ,COMMA and he turned around ,COMMA and he looked like this .PERIOD 
No hair ,COMMA no eyelashes ,COMMA no nothing .PERIOD 
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet ;SEMICOLON the air was the just full of black smoke .PERIOD 
She came home ,COMMA she took that chemistry set away ,COMMA and we never saw it again .PERIOD 
But we thought of it often ,COMMA because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made -DASH -DASH tasted faintly of gunpowder .PERIOD 
So I like to invent things too ,COMMA and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back .PERIOD 
When drum machines were new ,COMMA I got to thinking ,COMMA why couldn't you take the oldest form of music ,COMMA the hambone rhythms ,COMMA and combine it with the newest technology ?QUESTIONMARK 
I call this Thunderwear .PERIOD 
At that time ,COMMA drum triggers were new .PERIOD 
And so I put them all together and sewed <NUM> of them in this suit .PERIOD 
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ;SEMICOLON I'm going to be doing some of the same ones .PERIOD 
I have a trigger here ,COMMA trigger here ,COMMA here ,COMMA here .PERIOD Right there .PERIOD 
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the drum triggers go out my tail here ,COMMA into the drum machine ,COMMA and they can make various sounds ,COMMA like drums .PERIOD 
So let me put them all together .PERIOD And also ,COMMA I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here ,COMMA and -DASH -DASH let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this .PERIOD 
Thank you ,COMMA folks .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA about three years ago I was in London ,COMMA and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said ,COMMA I represent a group of people ,COMMA and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics .PERIOD 
We want to be in the forefront fields ,COMMA and we want to do it differently .PERIOD 
We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas ,COMMA and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done .PERIOD 
It took me about <NUM> seconds to decide that that was a good idea .PERIOD 
Three years later ,COMMA we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo ,COMMA Ontario .PERIOD It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had .PERIOD 
And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here .PERIOD 
But in any case ,COMMA what I’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we think a lot about what really makes science work ?QUESTIONMARK 
On the other hand ,COMMA somehow we manage to reason together as a community ,COMMA from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about .PERIOD 
And this is ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA something that a democratic society also has to do .PERIOD 
So how does it work ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics .PERIOD 
And here are some of the ethical principles .PERIOD 
I’m in entertain ,COMMA amaze mode .PERIOD 
But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe .PERIOD 
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide ,COMMA you know ,COMMA whether I’m right or somebody else is right ,COMMA are the people in our community in the next generation ,COMMA in <NUM> and <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So it’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we’re in ,COMMA and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere ,COMMA that makes science work .PERIOD 
And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA teaches us about democracy .PERIOD 
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy ,COMMA but there has been ,COMMA historically ,COMMA a relationship between how people think about space and time ,COMMA and what the cosmos is ,COMMA and how people think about the society that they live in .PERIOD 
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science ,COMMA and that was hierarchical .PERIOD 
The earth is in the center ,COMMA then there are these crystal spheres ,COMMA the sun ,COMMA the moon ,COMMA the planets and finally the celestial sphere ,COMMA where the stars are .PERIOD And everything in this universe has a place .PERIOD 
And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place ,COMMA which was of course ,COMMA the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in ,COMMA and more importantly ,COMMA the medieval society that ,COMMA through Christianity ,COMMA embraced Aristotle and blessed it .PERIOD 
And the idea is that everything is defined .PERIOD 
Where something is ,COMMA is defined with respect to this last sphere ,COMMA the celestial sphere ,COMMA outside of which is this eternal ,COMMA perfect realm ,COMMA where lives God ,COMMA who is the ultimate judge of everything .PERIOD 
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology ,COMMA and in a certain sense ,COMMA medieval society .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton .PERIOD 
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators .PERIOD 
And they were very closely associated .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA Newton and Locke were friends .PERIOD 
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand ,COMMA and a society on the other hand ,COMMA were closely related .PERIOD 
And let me show you .PERIOD 
In a Newtonian universe ,COMMA there’s no center -DASH -DASH thank you .PERIOD 
There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed ,COMMA absolute framework of space and time .PERIOD 
It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space ,COMMA because that’s defined ,COMMA not with respect to say ,COMMA where other things are ,COMMA but with respect to this absolute notion of space ,COMMA which for Newton was God .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA similarly ,COMMA in Locke’s society there are individuals who have certain rights ,COMMA properties in a formal sense ,COMMA and those are defined with respect to some absolute ,COMMA abstract notions of rights and justice ,COMMA and so forth ,COMMA which are independent of what else has happened in the society .PERIOD 
Of who else there is ,COMMA of the history and so forth .PERIOD 
There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything ,COMMA who is God ,COMMA who is in a certain sense outside the universe ,COMMA because he has no role in anything that happens ,COMMA but is in a certain sense everywhere ,COMMA because space is just the way that God knows where everything is ,COMMA according to Newton ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
So this is the foundations of what’s called ,COMMA traditionally ,COMMA liberal political theory and Newtonian physics .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century ,COMMA and which is still going on .PERIOD 
It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory .PERIOD 
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity ,COMMA is the culmination of that ,COMMA something that’s going on right now .PERIOD 
And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute .PERIOD Zilch ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
This universe is described by being a network of relationships .PERIOD 
Space is just one aspect ,COMMA so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is .PERIOD 
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is .PERIOD 
And this network of relations is ever-evolving .PERIOD 
So we call it a relational universe .PERIOD 
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships ,COMMA your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations .PERIOD 
And there’s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything .PERIOD 
So this is general relativity ,COMMA this is quantum theory .PERIOD 
This is also ,COMMA if you talk to legal scholars ,COMMA the foundations of new ideas in legal thought .PERIOD 
They’re thinking about the same things .PERIOD 
And not only that ,COMMA they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often .PERIOD 
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there .PERIOD 
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view .PERIOD 
So the main slogan here is that there’s nothing outside the universe ,COMMA which means that there’s no place to put an explanation for something outside .PERIOD 
So in such a relational universe ,COMMA if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured ,COMMA like this device here ,COMMA or that device there ,COMMA or something beautiful ,COMMA like all the living things ,COMMA all of you guys in the room -DASH -DASH guys in physics ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is a generic term :COLON men and women .PERIOD 
Then you want to know ,COMMA you’re a person ,COMMA you want to know how is it made .PERIOD 
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was ,COMMA somehow it made itself .PERIOD 
There must be mechanisms of self-organization inside the universe that make things .PERIOD 
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside ,COMMA as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe .PERIOD 
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see .PERIOD 
So it works .PERIOD But not only that ,COMMA if you think about how natural selection works ,COMMA then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA natural selection works on properties ,COMMA like fitness ,COMMA which are about relationships of some species to some other species .PERIOD 
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe ,COMMA and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe .PERIOD 
So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems .PERIOD 
And if you push that all the way down ,COMMA really ,COMMA it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA not only that ,COMMA but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational .PERIOD 
If it wasn’t for gravity ,COMMA there wouldn’t be life ,COMMA because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time ,COMMA keeping pieces of the world ,COMMA like the surface of the Earth ,COMMA out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve .PERIOD 
In the 20th century ,COMMA we saw the independent development of two big themes in science .PERIOD 
In the biological sciences ,COMMA they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self-organized way .PERIOD 
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth .PERIOD 
And slowly ,COMMA that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences ,COMMA the human sciences ,COMMA economics ,COMMA et cetera .PERIOD 
At the same time ,COMMA we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity .PERIOD 
And what we’ve been working out is the implications ,COMMA really ,COMMA of the idea that the universe is made up of relations .PERIOD 
21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas :COLON the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world ,COMMA on the one hand ,COMMA and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world ,COMMA on the other hand .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology ,COMMA and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve .PERIOD 
And what they’re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas ,COMMA Darwinism and relationalism .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if you think about democracy from this perspective ,COMMA a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests ,COMMA many different agendas ,COMMA many different individuals ,COMMA many different points of view .PERIOD 
Each one is incomplete ,COMMA because you’re embedded in a network of relationships .PERIOD 
Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships .PERIOD 
And you understand some things better than other things ,COMMA and because of that there’s a continual jostling and give and take ,COMMA which is politics .PERIOD 
And politics is ,COMMA in the ideal sense ,COMMA the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society .PERIOD 
And I also think that science will never go away and -DASH -DASH I’m finishing on this line .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I’m finished .PERIOD Science will never go away .PERIOD 
I run a design studio in New York .PERIOD 
Every seven years ,COMMA I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments ,COMMA things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year .PERIOD 
And as you can imagine ,COMMA it is a lovely and very energetic time .PERIOD 
I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves ,COMMA music and design .PERIOD 
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know ,COMMA and for even more that you've never heard of .PERIOD 
As I realized ,COMMA just like with many many things in my life that I actually love ,COMMA I adapt to it .PERIOD 
And I get ,COMMA over time ,COMMA bored by them .PERIOD 
And for sure ,COMMA in our case ,COMMA our work started to look the same .PERIOD 
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .PERIOD 
So I decided to close it down for one year .PERIOD 
Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first <NUM> years of our lives learning ,COMMA then there is another <NUM> years that's really reserved for working .PERIOD 
And then tacked on at the end of it are about <NUM> years for retirement .PERIOD 
And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years .PERIOD 
That's clearly enjoyable for myself .PERIOD 
But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large ,COMMA rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .PERIOD 
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago ,COMMA Jonathan Haidt ,COMMA who defined his work into three different levels .PERIOD 
And they rang very true for me .PERIOD 
I can see my work as a job .PERIOD I do it for money .PERIOD 
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism .PERIOD 
In a career I'm definitely more engaged .PERIOD 
But at the same time ,COMMA there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while ?QUESTIONMARK 
While in the third one ,COMMA in the calling ,COMMA very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it .PERIOD 
I am not a religious person myself ,COMMA but I did look for nature .PERIOD 
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City .PERIOD 
Looked for something different for the second one .PERIOD 
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali .PERIOD 
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on ,COMMA so Bali it was .PERIOD 
It's a wonderful ,COMMA very craft-oriented society .PERIOD 
I arrived there in September <NUM> ,COMMA and pretty much started to work right away .PERIOD 
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself .PERIOD 
However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily .PERIOD 
And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house ,COMMA and attacked me during my morning walks .PERIOD 
So we created this series of <NUM> portraits on tee shirts .PERIOD 
Every single dog on one tee shirt .PERIOD 
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt .PERIOD 
Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio .PERIOD 
And then just leave it all to them .PERIOD 
And I don't have to do anything .PERIOD 
And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked ,COMMA I couldn't afford .PERIOD 
And all the stuff I could afford ,COMMA I didn't like .PERIOD 
This one ,COMMA of course ,COMMA still works with the wild dogs .PERIOD 
It's not quite finished yet .PERIOD 
Then there is a coffee table .PERIOD I also did a coffee table .PERIOD 
It's called Be Here Now .PERIOD 
It includes <NUM> compasses .PERIOD 
And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside ,COMMA and make those compasses go crazy ,COMMA always centering on them .PERIOD 
Then this is a fairly talkative ,COMMA verbose kind of chair .PERIOD 
And at the same time ,COMMA I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses .PERIOD 
So I will not really go too far into it .PERIOD 
Many of you will know this TEDster ,COMMA Danny Gilbert ,COMMA whose book ,COMMA actually ,COMMA I got it through the TED book club .PERIOD 
I think it took me four years to finally read it ,COMMA while on sabbatical .PERIOD 
And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .PERIOD 
And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals .PERIOD 
This is Ferran Adria .PERIOD Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona ,COMMA El Bulli .PERIOD 
His restaurant is open seven months every year .PERIOD 
He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .PERIOD 
He can seat ,COMMA throughout the year ,COMMA he can seat <NUM> people .PERIOD 
And he has <NUM> million requests for reservations .PERIOD 
If I look at my cycle ,COMMA seven years ,COMMA one year sabbatical ,COMMA it's <NUM> percent of my time .PERIOD 
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine ,COMMA 3M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers <NUM> percent to pursue whatever they want .PERIOD 
There is some good successes .PERIOD 
Scotch tape came out of this program ,COMMA as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M .PERIOD 
Google ,COMMA of course ,COMMA very famously gives <NUM> percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects .PERIOD 
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's about five percent of everybody .PERIOD 
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up .PERIOD 
Talk to them about if it was successful or not .PERIOD 
I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future ,COMMA my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it .PERIOD 
When I had the idea of doing one ,COMMA the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book .PERIOD 
And then I told as many ,COMMA many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on .PERIOD 
In the beginning ,COMMA on the first sabbatical ,COMMA it was rather disastrous .PERIOD 
I had thought that I should do this without any plan ,COMMA that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation .PERIOD It was not .PERIOD 
I just ,COMMA without a plan ,COMMA I just reacted to little requests ,COMMA not work requests ,COMMA those I all said no to ,COMMA but other little requests .PERIOD 
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that .PERIOD 
And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in ,COMMA put them in a hierarchy ,COMMA divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan ,COMMA very much like in grade school .PERIOD 
What does it say here ?QUESTIONMARK Monday ,COMMA <NUM> to <NUM> :COLON story writing ;SEMICOLON <NUM> to <NUM> :COLON future thinking .PERIOD 
Was not very successful .PERIOD And so on and so forth .PERIOD 
And that actually ,COMMA specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical ,COMMA worked really well for me .PERIOD 
What came out of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I really got close to design again .PERIOD 
Because of the improved quality ,COMMA we could ask for higher prices .PERIOD 
And probably most importantly ,COMMA basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year .PERIOD 
And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical .PERIOD 
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated .PERIOD 
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies ,COMMA and not for everybody else .PERIOD 
And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture ,COMMA I failed at that .PERIOD 
And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto ,COMMA where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .PERIOD 
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English ,COMMA basically as logo making .PERIOD 
And I understood that the building itself was a logo .PERIOD 
So then it became quite easy .PERIOD 
We put a mask on it ,COMMA looked at it deep down in the ground ,COMMA checked it out from all sides ,COMMA west ,COMMA north ,COMMA south ,COMMA east ,COMMA top and bottom .PERIOD 
Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software ,COMMA the Casa da Musica Logo Generator .PERIOD 
That's connected to a scanner .PERIOD 
You put any image in there ,COMMA like that Beethoven image .PERIOD 
And the software ,COMMA in a second ,COMMA will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo .PERIOD 
Which ,COMMA when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster ,COMMA comes in handy ,COMMA because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .PERIOD 
So it will always fit together ,COMMA conceptually ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
If Zappa's music is performed ,COMMA it gets its own logo .PERIOD 
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers ,COMMA who all performed there ,COMMA get their own Casa da Musica logo .PERIOD 
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director ,COMMA whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards .PERIOD 
There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .PERIOD 
The truck they go on tour with .PERIOD 
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra ,COMMA <NUM> people that remixes its own title .PERIOD 
And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it .PERIOD 
Like this Donna Toney poster ,COMMA or Chopin ,COMMA or Mozart ,COMMA or La Monte Young .PERIOD 
You can take the shape and make typography out of it .PERIOD 
You can grow it underneath the skin .PERIOD 
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house ,COMMA or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program ,COMMA as well as educational services .PERIOD 
Second insight .PERIOD So far ,COMMA until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes ,COMMA which was fine with me .PERIOD 
On one hand I have nothing against selling .PERIOD 
My parents are both salespeople .PERIOD 
But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language ,COMMA why do I only promote with it ?QUESTIONMARK 
There must be something else .PERIOD 
And the whole series of work came out of it .PERIOD 
I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before ,COMMA under the title Things I've Learned in My Life So Far .PERIOD 
I'll just show two now .PERIOD 
This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York .PERIOD 
It says ,COMMA Self-confidence produces fine results .PERIOD 
This is after a week .PERIOD 
After two weeks ,COMMA three weeks ,COMMA four weeks ,COMMA five weeks .PERIOD 
And you see the self confidence almost comes back ,COMMA but not quite .PERIOD 
These are some pictures visitors sent to me .PERIOD 
And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something .PERIOD 
We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece .PERIOD 
We got <NUM> coins from the central bank ,COMMA at different darknesses .PERIOD 
So we got brand new ones ,COMMA shiny ones ,COMMA medium ones ,COMMA and very old ,COMMA dark ones .PERIOD 
And with the help of <NUM> volunteers ,COMMA over a week ,COMMA created this fairly floral typography that spelled ,COMMA Obsessions make my life worse and my work better .PERIOD 
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between ,COMMA Should I really take as much money as I can ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now ?QUESTIONMARK 
While we built all this up during that week ,COMMA with the <NUM> volunteers ,COMMA a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it .PERIOD 
So when it was finally done ,COMMA and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry ,COMMA one of the neighbors called the police .PERIOD 
And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom ,COMMA came ,COMMA saw ,COMMA and they wanted to protect the artwork .PERIOD 
And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .PERIOD 
I think you see ,COMMA you see them sweeping .PERIOD You see them sweeping right here .PERIOD 
That's the police ,COMMA getting rid of it all .PERIOD 
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali .PERIOD 
It's a movie about happiness .PERIOD 
And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us .PERIOD 
They weren't quite slick enough .PERIOD 
So we asked the goose to do it again ,COMMA and hoped she would do somehow ,COMMA a more elegant or pretty job .PERIOD 
And I think she overdid it .PERIOD 
Just a bit too ornamental .PERIOD 
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest .PERIOD 
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked ,COMMA actually ,COMMA fairly happy .PERIOD 
So we asked those guys to do it again .PERIOD 
They did a fine job ,COMMA but had a couple of readability problems .PERIOD 
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly .PERIOD 
That film we'll be working on for the next two years .PERIOD 
So it's going to be a while .PERIOD 
And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile .PERIOD 
Then you can of course always go and see this guy .PERIOD 
Video :COLON And I'm happy I'm alive .PERIOD 
I'm happy I'm alive .PERIOD I'm happy I'm alive .PERIOD 
Stefan Sagmeister :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm interested in how many are three to <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
None ,COMMA huh ?QUESTIONMARK 
All right .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs .PERIOD 
Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age ?QUESTIONMARK 
Dinosaurs are kind of funny ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
We're going to kind of go in a different direction right now .PERIOD 
I hope you all realize that .PERIOD 
That's it .PERIOD 
What's the fascination ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I usually just say ,COMMA Well dinosaurs were big ,COMMA different and gone .PERIOD 
They're all gone .PERIOD 
Well that's not true ,COMMA but we'll get to the goose in a minute .PERIOD 
So that's sort of the theme :COLON big ,COMMA different and gone .PERIOD 
The title of my talk :COLON Shape-shifting Dinosaurs :COLON The Cause of a Premature Extinction .PERIOD 
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs .PERIOD 
And there's lots of different shapes .PERIOD 
Lots of different kinds .PERIOD 
A long time ago ,COMMA back in the early 1900s ,COMMA museums were out looking for dinosaurs .PERIOD 
They went out and gathered them up .PERIOD 
And this is an interesting story .PERIOD 
So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur ,COMMA a big one ,COMMA then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one .PERIOD 
And that happened for all museums .PERIOD 
And this was in the early 1900s .PERIOD 
By about <NUM> ,COMMA some scientists were sitting around and they thought ,COMMA What in the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
Look at these dinosaurs .PERIOD 
They're all big .PERIOD 
Where are all the little ones ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA go to a museum ,COMMA you'll see ,COMMA see how many baby dinosaurs there are .PERIOD 
People assumed -DASH -DASH and this was actually a problem -DASH -DASH people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs ,COMMA if they had juvenile dinosaurs ,COMMA they'd be easy to identify .PERIOD 
You'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur .PERIOD 
But all they had were big dinosaurs .PERIOD 
And it comes down to a couple of things .PERIOD 
They like to name anything .PERIOD 
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .PERIOD 
And so every time they found something that looked a little different ,COMMA they named it something different .PERIOD 
And what happened ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA a light went on in somebody's head .PERIOD 
Dr .PERIOD Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do ,COMMA which is different than the way reptiles grow .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA he used the cassowary as an example .PERIOD 
And it's kind of cool -DASH -DASH if you look at the cassowary ,COMMA or any of the birds that have crests on their heads ,COMMA they actually grow to about <NUM> percent adult size before the crest starts to grow .PERIOD 
Now think about that .PERIOD 
They're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny .PERIOD 
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth .PERIOD 
So you can see that if you actually found one that was <NUM> percent grown and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary ,COMMA you would think they were two different animals .PERIOD 
So this was a problem ,COMMA and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus .PERIOD 
And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like ,COMMA if it grew in sort of a linear fashion ,COMMA it would have a crest about half the size of the adult .PERIOD 
But the actual sub-adult at <NUM> percent had no crest at all .PERIOD 
So this was interesting .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA if they'd have just taken that ,COMMA taken Peter Dodson's work ,COMMA and gone on with that ,COMMA then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have .PERIOD 
But scientists have egos ;SEMICOLON they like to name things .PERIOD 
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different .PERIOD 
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur ,COMMA or any animal ,COMMA is a young one or an older one .PERIOD 
And that's by actually cutting into their bones .PERIOD 
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do ,COMMA as you can imagine ,COMMA because in museums bones are precious .PERIOD 
You go into a museum and they take really good care of them .PERIOD 
They put them in foam ,COMMA little containers .PERIOD 
They're very well taken care of .PERIOD 
They don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .PERIOD 
So they don't normally let you do that .PERIOD 
So that's what I do .PERIOD 
So if you cut open a little dinosaur ,COMMA it's very spongy inside like A .PERIOD 
You can tell it's mature bone .PERIOD 
So it's real easy to tell them apart .PERIOD 
So what I want to do is show you these .PERIOD 
In North America in the Northern Plains of the United States and the Southern Plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan ,COMMA there's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth .PERIOD 
And there are <NUM> of them that everyone recognizes -DASH -DASH I mean the <NUM> primary dinosaurs that went extinct .PERIOD 
And so we will evaluate them .PERIOD 
And that's sort of what I've been doing .PERIOD 
So my students ,COMMA my staff ,COMMA we've been cutting them open .PERIOD 
Now as you can imagine ,COMMA cutting open a leg bone is one thing ,COMMA but when you go to a museum and say ,COMMA You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull do you ?QUESTIONMARK 
they say ,COMMA Go away .PERIOD 
So here are <NUM> dinosaurs .PERIOD 
And we want to look at these three first .PERIOD 
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs .PERIOD 
And everybody knows that these three animals are related .PERIOD 
And the assumption is is that they're related like cousins or whatever .PERIOD 
But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA people looked at them and they saw the differences .PERIOD 
And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you're related to your brother or your sister ,COMMA you can't do it by looking at differences .PERIOD 
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .PERIOD 
So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .PERIOD 
Pachycephalosaurus has a big ,COMMA thick dome on its head ,COMMA and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head ,COMMA and it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose .PERIOD 
And then Stygimoloch ,COMMA another dinosaur from the same age ,COMMA lived at the same time ,COMMA has spikes sticking out the back of its head .PERIOD 
It's got a little ,COMMA tiny dome ,COMMA and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose .PERIOD 
And then there's this thing called Dracorex ,COMMA Hogwart's Eye .PERIOD 
Guess where that came from ?QUESTIONMARK Dragon .PERIOD 
But they did look at these three and they said ,COMMA These are three different dinosaurs ,COMMA and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them .PERIOD 
And the other one is more primitive than the other .PERIOD 
It's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out .PERIOD 
But if you line them up ,COMMA if you just take those three skulls and just line them up ,COMMA they line up like this .PERIOD 
And one would think ,COMMA that should give me a clue .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA well we know why .PERIOD 
Scientists like to name things .PERIOD 
So if we cut open Dracorex -DASH -DASH I cut open our Dracorex -DASH -DASH and look ,COMMA it was spongy inside ,COMMA really spongy inside .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast .PERIOD 
So it is going to get bigger .PERIOD 
If you cut open Stygimoloch ,COMMA it is doing the same thing .PERIOD 
The dome ,COMMA that little dome ,COMMA is growing really fast .PERIOD 
It's inflating very fast .PERIOD 
What's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well .PERIOD 
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing ,COMMA which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger .PERIOD 
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus ,COMMA Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing .PERIOD 
So just with these three dinosaurs ,COMMA you can easily -DASH -DASH as a scientist -DASH -DASH we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal .PERIOD 
Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD 
Which of course means we have <NUM> primary dinosaurs to deal with .PERIOD 
So a colleague of mine at Berkley ,COMMA he and I were looking at Triceratops .PERIOD 
And before the year <NUM> -DASH -DASH now remember ,COMMA Triceratops was first found in the 1800s -DASH -DASH before <NUM> ,COMMA no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops .PERIOD 
There's a Triceratops in every museum in the world ,COMMA but no one had ever collected a juvenile .PERIOD 
And we know why ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because everybody wants to have a big one .PERIOD 
So everyone had a big one .PERIOD 
So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .PERIOD 
They're everywhere .PERIOD They're all over the place .PERIOD 
And everybody says it's because I have a little museum .PERIOD 
When you have a little museum ,COMMA you have little dinosaurs .PERIOD 
If you look at the Triceratops ,COMMA you can see it's changing ,COMMA it's shape-shifting .PERIOD 
As the juveniles are growing up ,COMMA their horns actually curve backwards .PERIOD 
And that's pretty cool .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA because the juveniles are in my collection ,COMMA I cut them open and look inside .PERIOD 
And the little one is really spongy .PERIOD 
And the middle size one is really spongy .PERIOD 
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy .PERIOD 
And this is a skull that is two meters long .PERIOD 
It's a big skull .PERIOD 
But there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops ,COMMA except it's bigger ,COMMA and it's called Torosaurus .PERIOD 
And Torosaurus ,COMMA when we cut into it ,COMMA has mature bone .PERIOD 
But it's got these big holes in its shield .PERIOD 
And everybody says ,COMMA A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one .PERIOD 
And it has holes in its frill .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they said ,COMMA Well no ,COMMA but it has holes in its frill .PERIOD 
So one of my graduate students ,COMMA John Scannella ,COMMA looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and ,COMMA of course it's open ,COMMA in Torosaurus -DASH -DASH so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus ,COMMA which was pretty cool .PERIOD 
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops .PERIOD 
Now when we name dinosaurs ,COMMA when we name anything ,COMMA the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out .PERIOD 
So Torosaurus is extinct .PERIOD 
Triceratops ,COMMA if you've heard the news ,COMMA a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong .PERIOD 
They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out ,COMMA but that's not going to happen .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan .PERIOD 
Anatotitan :COLON giant duck .PERIOD 
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur .PERIOD 
Here's another one .PERIOD 
So we look at the bone histology .PERIOD 
The bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile ,COMMA or at least a sub-adult ,COMMA and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny .PERIOD 
So we can just keep doing this .PERIOD 
And the last one is T .PERIOD Rex .PERIOD 
So there's these two dinosaurs ,COMMA T .PERIOD Rex and Nanotyrannus .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA makes you wonder .PERIOD 
But they had a good question .PERIOD 
They were looking at them and they said ,COMMA One's got <NUM> teeth ,COMMA and the biggest one's got <NUM> teeth .PERIOD 
And that doesn't make any sense at all ,COMMA because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older .PERIOD 
So it must be true -DASH -DASH they must be different .PERIOD 
So we cut into them .PERIOD 
And sure enough ,COMMA Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone .PERIOD 
It looks like it could still get bigger .PERIOD 
And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work ,COMMA I have four T .PERIOD Rexes ,COMMA so I can cut a whole bunch of them .PERIOD 
But I didn't have to cut any of them really ,COMMA because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had <NUM> teeth and the next smallest one had <NUM> and the next smallest had <NUM> .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA Nano has <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we just went out and looked at other people's collections and we found one that has sort of <NUM> teeth .PERIOD 
So when it comes down to our end cretaceous ,COMMA we have seven left .PERIOD 
And that's a good number .PERIOD 
That's a good number to go extinct ,COMMA I think .PERIOD 
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs ,COMMA they memorize them .PERIOD 
And they're not happy with this .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space ,COMMA architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses .PERIOD 
Our work is across media .PERIOD The work comes in all shapes and sizes .PERIOD 
It's small and large .PERIOD This is an ashtray ,COMMA a water glass .PERIOD 
From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff .PERIOD 
The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space .PERIOD 
And these are everyday conventions ,COMMA conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity .PERIOD 
And I've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect .PERIOD 
And that is something like nothing ,COMMA or something next to nothing .PERIOD 
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through .PERIOD 
This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo <NUM> on Lake Neuchatel ,COMMA near Geneva .PERIOD 
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context ,COMMA but as a primary building material .PERIOD 
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA no walls ,COMMA no roof ,COMMA no purpose -DASH -DASH just a mass of atomized water ,COMMA a big cloud .PERIOD 
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions ,COMMA which feeds ,COMMA or has been feeding ,COMMA our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity .PERIOD 
High definition ,COMMA in our opinion ,COMMA has become the new orthodoxy .PERIOD 
And we ask the question ,COMMA can we use technology ,COMMA high technology ,COMMA to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition ,COMMA that also challenges the conventions of space and skin ,COMMA and rethinks our dependence on vision ?QUESTIONMARK 
So this is how we sought to do it .PERIOD 
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles ,COMMA <NUM> of them .PERIOD And a weather station is on the structure .PERIOD 
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature ,COMMA humidity ,COMMA wind direction ,COMMA wind speed ,COMMA dew point ,COMMA and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout .PERIOD 
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is just in construction ,COMMA and there's a tensegrity structure .PERIOD 
It's about <NUM> feet wide ,COMMA the size of a football field ,COMMA and it sits on just four very delicate columns .PERIOD 
These are the fog nozzles ,COMMA the interface ,COMMA and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather ,COMMA and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we're very interested in creating weather .PERIOD I don't know why .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here we go ,COMMA one side ,COMMA the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was .PERIOD 
Unlike entering any normal space ,COMMA entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium .PERIOD 
It's formless ,COMMA featureless ,COMMA depthless ,COMMA scaleless ,COMMA massless ,COMMA purposeless and dimensionless .PERIOD 
All references are erased ,COMMA leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do .PERIOD 
And we pride ourselves -DASH -DASH it's a spectacular anti-spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the audience is dispersed ,COMMA focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog .PERIOD 
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way .PERIOD 
So here the world is put out of focus ,COMMA while our visual dependence is put into focus .PERIOD 
The public ,COMMA you know ,COMMA once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all the waters of the world are served there ,COMMA so we thought that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water ,COMMA you could also drink this building .PERIOD 
And so it is sort of a theme ,COMMA but it goes a little bit ,COMMA you know ,COMMA deeper than that .PERIOD 
We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense ,COMMA and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell ,COMMA because the Swiss said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA why are we going to spend ,COMMA you know ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate ?QUESTIONMARK 
And ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we thought -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA we tried to convince them .PERIOD 
And in the end ,COMMA you know ,COMMA they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt ,COMMA which we -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed ,COMMA and so it's now a memory of an apparition ,COMMA actually ,COMMA but it continues to live in edible form .PERIOD 
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -DASH -DASH to have a chocolate bar .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA moving along .PERIOD 
So in the '80s and '90s ,COMMA we were mostly known for independent work ,COMMA such as installation artist ,COMMA architect ,COMMA commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations .PERIOD 
And we did a lot of media work ,COMMA also a lot of experimental theater projects .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective ,COMMA and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show .PERIOD 
This was a piece on tourism in the United States .PERIOD 
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation .PERIOD 
Master/Slave at the MOMA ,COMMA the project series ,COMMA a piece called Parasite .PERIOD 
And so there were many ,COMMA many of these kinds of projects .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA they gave us the whole fourth floor ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with .PERIOD 
It's a kind of invention of the museum that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work .PERIOD 
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all .PERIOD 
And one of the recurring themes ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself ,COMMA and asking about the conventions of the museum ,COMMA like the wall ,COMMA the white wall .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there .PERIOD 
And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces ,COMMA which didn't belong together .PERIOD 
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time .PERIOD 
We used the wall to partition the <NUM> installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation .PERIOD 
And what you see is -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element ,COMMA which was a new piece that created -DASH -DASH that we created for the -DASH -DASH which was a robotic drill ,COMMA basically ,COMMA that went all the way around ,COMMA cruised the museum ,COMMA went all around the walls and did a lot of damage .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the drill was mounted on this robotic arm .PERIOD 
We worked with ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA Honeybee Robotics .PERIOD This is the brain .PERIOD 
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller ,COMMA and it was really very much fun to work with them .PERIOD 
In any case ,COMMA the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA unfolded it's about <NUM> linear feet .PERIOD 
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix .PERIOD 
It selects a point ,COMMA it guides the drill to that point ,COMMA it pierces the dry wall ,COMMA leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location .PERIOD 
Initially these holes were lone blemishes ,COMMA and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated .PERIOD 
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned ,COMMA opening views from gallery to gallery .PERIOD 
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall .PERIOD 
And so this was a three-month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element .PERIOD 
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed .PERIOD 
Also the visual separation .PERIOD 
And there was also this constant background groan ,COMMA which was very annoying .PERIOD 
And this is one of the blackout spaces where there's a video piece that became totally not useful .PERIOD 
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display ,COMMA the wall now actively competed for attention .PERIOD 
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective .PERIOD 
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text .PERIOD 
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .PERIOD 
It's the ICA -DASH -DASH the Institute of Contemporary Art -DASH -DASH in Boston ,COMMA which is on the waterfront .PERIOD 
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building ,COMMA but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA it's a really great waterfront site in Boston -DASH -DASH and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -DASH -DASH I mean that's its primary objective ,COMMA both its program and its architectural conceit .PERIOD 
The building incorporates the site ,COMMA but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater ,COMMA by the belly of the theater ,COMMA into this very compressed space where the view is turned off .PERIOD 
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .PERIOD 
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA this is a view going up ,COMMA and then you could come into the theater ,COMMA which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop .PERIOD 
The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light ,COMMA and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view .PERIOD 
The original intention of this space ,COMMA which was unfortunately never realized ,COMMA was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out .PERIOD 
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax ,COMMA but to have the view stalk you ,COMMA so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other .PERIOD 
This was eliminated because the view was too good ,COMMA and the mayor said ,COMMA No ,COMMA we just want this open .PERIOD 
The architect lost here .PERIOD 
But culminating -DASH -DASH and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk -DASH -DASH is this Mediatheque ,COMMA which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building .PERIOD 
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -DASH -DASH it's quite substantial .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's already sticking out into space enough ,COMMA and then from that is this ,COMMA is this small area called the Mediatheque .PERIOD 
The Mediatheque has something like <NUM> stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web .PERIOD 
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building ,COMMA and here is a point where architecture -DASH -DASH this is like technology-free -DASH -DASH architecture is only a framing device ,COMMA it only edits the harbor view ,COMMA the industrial harbor just through its walls ,COMMA its floors and its ceiling ,COMMA to only expose the water itself ,COMMA the texture of water ,COMMA much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that .PERIOD 
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project .PERIOD 
But there is just no information ,COMMA it's just -DASH -DASH it's just hypnosis .PERIOD 
Moving along to Lincoln Center .PERIOD 
These are the guys that did the project in the first place ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
We're taking over now ,COMMA doing work that ranges in scale from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions .PERIOD 
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone .PERIOD 
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by <NUM> .PERIOD 
And for the purposes of this talk ,COMMA I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects ,COMMA and it happens to be our current obsession ,COMMA and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction .PERIOD 
It's Alice Tully Hall ,COMMA and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be ,COMMA before the renovation ,COMMA which we just started .PERIOD 
And we asked ourselves ,COMMA why couldn't it be exhibitionistic ,COMMA like the Met ,COMMA or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center ?QUESTIONMARK 
And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity ,COMMA expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible .PERIOD 
And this building ,COMMA which is just naturally hermetic ,COMMA we stripped .PERIOD 
We basically did a striptease ,COMMA architectural striptease ,COMMA where we're framing with this kind of canopy -DASH -DASH the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard ,COMMA about <NUM> square feet -DASH -DASH cutting it to the angle of Broadway ,COMMA and then exposing ,COMMA using that canopy to frame Tully Hall .PERIOD 
Before and after shot .PERIOD 
Wait a minute ,COMMA it's just in that state ,COMMA we have a long way to go .PERIOD 
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself ,COMMA which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the hall is a multi-purpose hall .PERIOD 
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that's really tough to do with a hall that has <NUM> seats .PERIOD 
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall ?QUESTIONMARK 
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things .PERIOD 
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy .PERIOD 
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall .PERIOD 
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall .PERIOD 
It's like a coffin ,COMMA it basically sends all the sound ,COMMA like a gutter-ball effect ,COMMA down the aisles .PERIOD 
The walls are made of absorptive surface ,COMMA half absorptive ,COMMA half reflective ,COMMA which is not very good for concert sound .PERIOD 
This is Avery Fisher Hall ,COMMA but the notion of junk -DASH -DASH visual junk -DASH -DASH was very ,COMMA very important to us ,COMMA to get rid of visual noise .PERIOD 
Because we can't eliminate a single seat ,COMMA the architecture is restricted to <NUM> inches .PERIOD 
So it's a very ,COMMA very thin architecture .PERIOD 
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation ,COMMA to take away the distraction of the subway noise .PERIOD 
Next we wrap the entire hall -DASH -DASH almost like this Olivetti keyboard -DASH -DASH with a material ,COMMA with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces :COLON wall ,COMMA ceiling ,COMMA floor ,COMMA stage ,COMMA steps ,COMMA everything ,COMMA boxes .PERIOD 
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage .PERIOD And here's an acoustic shelf .PERIOD 
Looking up the hall .PERIOD Just a section of the stage .PERIOD 
Just everything is lined ,COMMA it incorporates -DASH -DASH every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high-performance skin .PERIOD 
But one more added feature .PERIOD 
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction ,COMMA everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house ,COMMA the audience ,COMMA with the performers ,COMMA we add one little detail ,COMMA one piece of architectural excess ,COMMA a special effect :COLON lighting .PERIOD 
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts .PERIOD 
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect ,COMMA this lighting effect ,COMMA which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls .PERIOD 
And what it entails is the use of resin ,COMMA of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall ,COMMA in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light ,COMMA like a belt of light :COLON rather than separating ,COMMA like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers ,COMMA it connects audience with players .PERIOD 
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City ,COMMA this is what they look like out there .PERIOD 
And for us ,COMMA I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing ,COMMA but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin ,COMMA very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier ,COMMA the walls will just exude this glow ,COMMA temporarily stealing attention from the stage .PERIOD 
And this is Tully in construction now .PERIOD 
I have no ending to say ,COMMA except that I'm a couple of minutes over .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I don't know how you keep it up ,COMMA Chris ,COMMA I really don't .PERIOD 
And it gets worse ,COMMA I crashed it into your house .PERIOD 
Your house has caught fire .PERIOD 
And what's more ,COMMA your wife has just run off with your best friend .PERIOD 
Thank you for sharing ,COMMA that's really interesting .PERIOD 
Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
One of the -DASH -DASH Thank you for inviting us .PERIOD 
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that ,COMMA gradually ,COMMA as the days go by ,COMMA all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say .PERIOD 
Nuclear fusion ,COMMA I had about <NUM> minutes on that .PERIOD 
Spectroscopy ,COMMA that was another one .PERIOD 
Parallel universes .PERIOD 
And so this morning I thought ,COMMA Oh well ,COMMA I'll just do a card trick .PERIOD

Don't go through this .PERIOD Don't do it .PERIOD 
I'm worried .PERIOD When I first got the invitation ,COMMA they said somewhere in the thing ,COMMA they said ,COMMA <NUM> minutes to change the world ,COMMA your moment onstage .PERIOD <NUM> minutes to change the world .PERIOD 
I don't know about you ,COMMA it takes me <NUM> minutes to change a plug .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA of course now we know we don't have to change a plug ,COMMA now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -DASH -DASH fantastic .PERIOD You know ,COMMA it inspires us .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that .PERIOD 
And now it's an idea .PERIOD 
It's great .PERIOD It's fantastic .PERIOD 
But you do meet some fantastic people ,COMMA people who look at the world in a totally different way .PERIOD 
Yesterday ,COMMA David Deutsch ,COMMA another one who covered most of what I was going to say .PERIOD 
But when you think of the world in that way ,COMMA it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience ,COMMA don't you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA he must walk in and they will say ,COMMA Would you like a macchiato ,COMMA or a latte ,COMMA or an Americano ,COMMA or a cappuccino ?QUESTIONMARK 
How can your coffee be true ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they will say ,COMMA Would you mind if I serve the next customer ?QUESTIONMARK 
And Elaine Morgan yesterday ,COMMA wasn't she wonderful ?QUESTIONMARK 
Fantastic .PERIOD Really good .PERIOD 
Her talk about the aquatic ape ,COMMA and the link ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -DASH -DASH we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well .PERIOD

 :COLON Hello ,COMMA can I tell you what happened in the woods back there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Uh ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
I'm sorry .PERIOD I've only got <NUM> minutes ,COMMA <NUM> minutes to talk about saving the world ,COMMA saving the planet ,COMMA global institutions .PERIOD 
Our work on climate change ,COMMA I've only got <NUM> minutes ,COMMA unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain ,COMMA like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport .. .PERIOD 
The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North ,COMMA and of course the exciting news that only today ,COMMA only this week ,COMMA Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close .PERIOD 
No time ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA to mention those .PERIOD 
British jobs for Scottish people .. .PERIOD

That reminds me ,COMMA I must post that letter .PERIOD 
I just think ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what people forget ,COMMA Gordon and I ,COMMA we always got on perfectly well .PERIOD 
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in <NUM> -DASH -DASH that was to the building ;SEMICOLON the people weren't listening .PERIOD 
But the people ,COMMA when talking about the finance industry ,COMMA he said ,COMMA What you as the city of London have done for financial services ,COMMA we ,COMMA as a government ,COMMA hope to do for the economy as a whole .PERIOD 
But we're in a new world now .PERIOD We're in a completely new world .PERIOD 
This is the first time that I can remember ,COMMA where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan ,COMMA you don't know if you're borrowing money from him ,COMMA or if he's borrowing money from you .PERIOD 
Am I right ?QUESTIONMARK 
These extraordinary things ,COMMA Icelandic Internet accounts .PERIOD

That's why the Prime Minister went on television .PERIOD He said ,COMMA This has left us all with a very big haddock .PERIOD 
A lot of what I do -DASH -DASH I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them .PERIOD 
And making sense of the financial crisis is very ,COMMA very difficult .PERIOD 
He was speaking at a dinner ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Wall Street got drunk .PERIOD 
And now it's got a hangover .PERIOD 
And that's ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that's something -DASH -DASH And that's something we can relate to .PERIOD 
It's certainly something he can relate to .PERIOD 
And the other one ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is Donald Rumsfeld ,COMMA who said ,COMMA There are the known knowns ,COMMA the things we know we know .PERIOD 
And then you got the known unknowns ,COMMA the things we know we don't know .PERIOD 
And then you got the unknown unknowns ,COMMA those are the things we don't know we don't know .PERIOD 
And being English ,COMMA when I first heard that I thought ,COMMA What a load of cock .PERIOD 
This whole ,COMMA what Ben Bernanke has said ,COMMA the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system ,COMMA it's about -DASH -DASH they don't know ,COMMA they didn't know what they were doing .PERIOD

But we have a new hope .PERIOD We have a new man .PERIOD 
America has now elected its first openly black President .PERIOD 
Wonderful news .PERIOD 
Not only that ,COMMA he's left-handed .PERIOD Have you noticed this ?QUESTIONMARK 
How many people here are left-handed ?QUESTIONMARK 
You see ,COMMA a lot of the people that I most admire ,COMMA they're great artists ,COMMA great designers ,COMMA great thinkers ,COMMA they're left-handed .PERIOD 
And somebody said to me last night ,COMMA you know ,COMMA being left-handed ,COMMA you have to learn to write without smudging the ink .PERIOD 
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday .PERIOD 
And I thought ,COMMA what a wonderful metaphor ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK An American President who has to write without smudging the ink .PERIOD 
You like that one ?QUESTIONMARK As opposed to you could see George Bush ,COMMA well ,COMMA what's the metaphor there ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing ,COMMA wouldn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA he's gone .PERIOD Now he's gone .PERIOD 
That's eight years of American History ,COMMA eight minutes of my act ,COMMA just gone like that .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's the end of an error [sic] .PERIOD 
I happen to believe it was a great error .PERIOD 
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States .PERIOD 
But we proved them wrong in Iraq .PERIOD 
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda .PERIOD 
There is now .PERIOD 
But I have a message for the suicide bombers ,COMMA for those people who've blown themselves up .PERIOD 
We're going to find you .PERIOD 
We're going to make sure you don't do it again .PERIOD 
But now he's gone ,COMMA and it's great to see one of the -DASH -DASH arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history ,COMMA now given way to one of the greatest ,COMMA in Obama .PERIOD 
You were there ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA on the night of his victory .PERIOD 
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago ,COMMA he said ,COMMA If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible .. .PERIOD 
I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long ,COMMA it really would .PERIOD 
But you get the picture .PERIOD And then it goes to the inauguration .PERIOD 
And he and the Chief Justice ,COMMA they trip over each other ,COMMA they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up .PERIOD 
And there is George Bush sitting there going ,COMMA Heh heh heh heh .. .PERIOD 
Not so easy is it ?QUESTIONMARK Heh heh heh .PERIOD 
But the interesting thing is ,COMMA Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero ,COMMA who said ,COMMA people would listen to a speech ,COMMA they said ,COMMA Great speech .PERIOD 
And then they'd listen to Demosthenes ,COMMA and they'd say ,COMMA Let's march .PERIOD 
And we all want to believe in President Obama .PERIOD 
It's rather like that line in the film As Good As it Gets .PERIOD 
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson ,COMMA and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson ,COMMA What do you see in me ?QUESTIONMARK 
And Jack Nicholson just says ,COMMA You make me want to be a better man .PERIOD 
But at the moment ,COMMA it's a Cicero thing .PERIOD 
We like what Barack Obama says ,COMMA but we don't do anything about it .PERIOD 
And everyone goes ,COMMA Great !EXCLAMATIONMARK He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA forget about that ,COMMA absolutely not .PERIOD Nothing happens .PERIOD He goes to Strasburg .PERIOD

So ,COMMA when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements ,COMMA let me tell you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there's him .PERIOD In Britain we have Prince Charles :COLON And the environment is so important ,COMMA all we can do .PERIOD 
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda .PERIOD 
Or ,COMMA any South Africans ,COMMA we have Mandela to inspire .PERIOD 
Mandela ,COMMA the great man Mandela .PERIOD

Ahh ,COMMA listen to me Mr .PERIOD Titchmarsh .PERIOD 
I was held in prison for nearly <NUM> years on an island in the middle of the ocean .PERIOD 
Why would I need a bloody water feature ?QUESTIONMARK 
Very quickly :COLON I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the Japanese Essays on Idleness which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth .PERIOD 
Thank you very much indeed .PERIOD 
Some <NUM> years ago ,COMMA I became allergic to Delhi's air .PERIOD 
My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to <NUM> percent ,COMMA and it was killing me .PERIOD 
With the help of IIT ,COMMA TERI ,COMMA and learnings from NASA ,COMMA we discovered that there are three basic green plants ,COMMA common green plants ,COMMA with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy .PERIOD 
We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building ,COMMA while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards .PERIOD 
The three plants are Areca palm ,COMMA Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant .PERIOD 
The botanical names are in front of you .PERIOD 
Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen .PERIOD 
We need four shoulder-high plants per person ,COMMA and in terms of plant care ,COMMA we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi ,COMMA and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities .PERIOD 
We had to grow them in vermi manure ,COMMA which is sterile ,COMMA or hydroponics ,COMMA and take them outdoors every three to four months .PERIOD 
The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue ,COMMA which is again a very common plant ,COMMA and we call it a bedroom plant ,COMMA because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night .PERIOD 
The third plant is money plant ,COMMA and this is again a very common plant ;SEMICOLON preferably grows in hydroponics .PERIOD 
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .PERIOD 
With these three plants ,COMMA you can grow all the fresh air you need .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA you could be in a bottle with a cap on top ,COMMA and you would not die at all ,COMMA and you would not need any fresh air .PERIOD 
We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi ,COMMA which is a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-square-feet ,COMMA 20-year-old building .PERIOD 
The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi .PERIOD 
And this study has been published on September <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA and it's available on the government of India website .PERIOD 
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over <NUM> percent by using these plants .PERIOD 
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding <NUM> percent ,COMMA because you need less fresh air .PERIOD 
We are now replicating this in a <NUM>.75-million-square-feet building ,COMMA which will have <NUM> indoor plants .PERIOD 
It is also important for the environment ,COMMA because the world's energy requirements are expected to grow by <NUM> percent in the next decade .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the world's energy is taken up by buildings currently ,COMMA and <NUM> percent of the world's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And there is a growing preference for living and working in air-conditioned places .PERIOD 
Be the change you want to see in the world ,COMMA said Mahatma Gandhi .PERIOD 
And thank you for listening .PERIOD 
Pat Mitchell :COLON What is the story of this pin ?QUESTIONMARK 
Madeleine Albright :COLON This is Breaking the Glass Ceiling .PERIOD 
Oh .PERIOD 
That was well chosen ,COMMA I would say ,COMMA for TEDWomen .PERIOD 
Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .PERIOD 
And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein .PERIOD 
I'll tell you what happened .PERIOD 
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador ,COMMA and it was after the Gulf War ,COMMA and I was an instructed ambassador .PERIOD 
And the cease-fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions ,COMMA and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly ,COMMA which he deserved -DASH -DASH he had invaded another country .PERIOD 
And so all of a sudden ,COMMA a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things ,COMMA but among them an unparalleled serpent .PERIOD 
And so I happened to have a snake pin .PERIOD 
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq .PERIOD 
And when I went out to meet the press ,COMMA they zeroed in ,COMMA said ,COMMA Why are you wearing that snake pin ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent .PERIOD 
And then I thought ,COMMA well this is fun .PERIOD 
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day .PERIOD 
So that's how it all started .PERIOD 
So how large is the collection ?QUESTIONMARK 
Pretty big .PERIOD 
It's now traveling .PERIOD 
At the moment it's in Indianapolis ,COMMA but it was at the Smithsonian .PERIOD 
And it goes with a book that says ,COMMA Read My Pins .PERIOD 
So is this a good idea .PERIOD 
I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State ,COMMA and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing ,COMMA how you looked -DASH -DASH the thing that happens to a lot of women ,COMMA especially if they're the first in a position .PERIOD 
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .PERIOD 
What was interesting was that ,COMMA before I went up to New York as U.N .PERIOD ambassador ,COMMA I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick ,COMMA who'd been ambassador before me ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA You've got to get rid of your professor clothes .PERIOD 
Go out and look like a diplomat .PERIOD 
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping .PERIOD 
But still ,COMMA there were all kinds of questions about -DASH -DASH did you wear a hat ?QUESTIONMARK How short was your skirt ?QUESTIONMARK 
And one of the things -DASH -DASH if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots ,COMMA and she got criticized over that .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA for all of us ,COMMA men and women ,COMMA finding our ways of defining our roles ,COMMA and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future .PERIOD 
Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well I've been a woman for <NUM> years ,COMMA but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes .PERIOD 
So it evolved .PERIOD 
But basically I love being a woman .PERIOD 
And so what happened -DASH -DASH and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this -DASH -DASH I went to my first meeting ,COMMA first at the U.N. ,COMMA and that's when this all started ,COMMA because that is a very male organization .PERIOD 
And I'm sitting there -DASH -DASH there are <NUM> members of the Security Council -DASH -DASH so <NUM> men sat there staring at me ,COMMA and I thought -DASH -DASH well you know how we all are .PERIOD 
You want to get the feeling of the room ,COMMA and do people like me ?QUESTIONMARK 
and will I really say something intelligent ?QUESTIONMARK 
And all of a sudden I thought ,COMMA Well ,COMMA wait a minute .PERIOD 
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States ,COMMA ' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard ,COMMA and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal ,COMMA reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country .PERIOD 
And so that happened more at various times ,COMMA but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .PERIOD 
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships ,COMMA and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary .PERIOD 
But I have to tell you ,COMMA I have my youngest granddaughter ,COMMA when she turned seven last year ,COMMA said to her mother ,COMMA my daughter ,COMMA So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State ?QUESTIONMARK 
Only girls are Secretary of State .PERIOD 
What a change that is .PERIOD 
As you travel now all over the world ,COMMA which you do frequently ,COMMA how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls ?QUESTIONMARK 
Where are we ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think we're slowly changing ,COMMA but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different .PERIOD 
And therefore it means that we have to remember that ,COMMA while many of us have had huge opportunities -DASH -DASH and Pat ,COMMA you have been a real leader in your field -DASH -DASH is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women .PERIOD 
And so what I have felt -DASH -DASH and I have looked at this from a national security issue -DASH -DASH when I was Secretary of State ,COMMA I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy ,COMMA not just because I'm a feminist ,COMMA but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered ,COMMA that values are passed down ,COMMA the health situation is better ,COMMA education is better ,COMMA there is greater economic prosperity .PERIOD 
So I think that it behooves us -DASH -DASH those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -DASH -DASH that we need to help other women .PERIOD 
And I really dedicated myself to that ,COMMA both at the U.N .PERIOD and then as Secretary of State .PERIOD 
And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ?QUESTIONMARK 
From some people .PERIOD 
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue .PERIOD 
The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues ,COMMA because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects ,COMMA and because ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA it is really central to the way that we think about things .PERIOD 
Now for instance ,COMMA some of the wars that took place when I was in office ,COMMA a lot of them ,COMMA the women were the main victims of it .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA when I started ,COMMA there were wars in the Balkans .PERIOD 
The women in Bosnia were being raped .PERIOD 
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA one of the things that I did at that stage was ,COMMA I had just arrived at the U.N. ,COMMA and when I was there ,COMMA there were <NUM> countries in the U.N .PERIOD 
Now there are <NUM> .PERIOD 
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself .PERIOD 
So I said to my assistant ,COMMA Invite the other women permanent representatives .PERIOD 
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there .PERIOD 
I get there ,COMMA and there are six other women ,COMMA out of <NUM> .PERIOD 
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada ,COMMA Kazakhstan ,COMMA Philippines ,COMMA Trinidad Tobago ,COMMA Jamaica ,COMMA Lichtenstein and me .PERIOD 
So being an American ,COMMA I decided to set up a caucus .PERIOD 
And so we set it up ,COMMA and we called ourselves the G7 .PERIOD 
Is that Girl <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK MA :COLON Girl <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues .PERIOD 
So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal .PERIOD 
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war ,COMMA that it was against humanity .PERIOD 
So when you look around the world and you see that ,COMMA in many cases -DASH -DASH certainly in the Western world -DASH -DASH women are evolving into more leadership positions ,COMMA and even other places some barriers are being brought down ,COMMA but there's still so much violence ,COMMA still so many problems ,COMMA and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables .PERIOD 
Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't ,COMMA when there was maybe you -DASH -DASH one voice ,COMMA maybe one or two others .PERIOD 
Do you believe ,COMMA and can you tell us why ,COMMA there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well I do think ,COMMA when there are more women ,COMMA that the tone of the conversation changes ,COMMA and also the goals of the conversation change .PERIOD 
But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women .PERIOD 
If you think that ,COMMA you've forgotten high school .PERIOD 
But the bottom line is that there is a way ,COMMA when there are more women at the table ,COMMA that there's an attempt to develop some understanding .PERIOD 
So for instance ,COMMA what I did when I went to Burundi ,COMMA we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda .PERIOD 
And so I think the capability of women to put themselves -DASH -DASH I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy .PERIOD 
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room .PERIOD 
When I was Secretary of State ,COMMA there were only <NUM> other women foreign ministers .PERIOD 
And so it was nice when one of them would show up .PERIOD 
For instance ,COMMA she is now the president of Finland ,COMMA but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and ,COMMA at a certain stage ,COMMA head of the European Union .PERIOD 
And it was really terrific .PERIOD 
Because one of the things I think you'll understand .PERIOD 
We went to a meeting ,COMMA and the men in my delegation ,COMMA when I would say ,COMMA Well I feel we should do something about this ,COMMA and they'd say ,COMMA What do you mean ,COMMA you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me .PERIOD 
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA Well I feel we should do this .PERIOD 
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden .PERIOD 
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions .PERIOD 
The other thing that I think is really important :COLON A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy ,COMMA but it's about budgets ,COMMA military budgets ,COMMA and how the debts of countries work out .PERIOD 
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts ,COMMA they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .PERIOD 
So how do we get this balance we're looking for ,COMMA then ,COMMA in the world ?QUESTIONMARK 
More women's voices at the table ?QUESTIONMARK 
More men who believe that the balance is best ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well I think one of the things -DASH -DASH I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates .PERIOD 
I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office ,COMMA to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices .PERIOD 
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other .PERIOD 
Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about ,COMMA because I am of a certain age where ,COMMA when I started in my career ,COMMA believe it or not ,COMMA there were other women who criticized me :COLON Why aren't you in the carpool line ?QUESTIONMARK 
or Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I think guilt is every woman's middle name .PERIOD 
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .PERIOD 
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other .PERIOD 
Well Secretary Albright ,COMMA I guess you'll be going to heaven .PERIOD 
Thank you all .PERIOD Thanks Pat .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA people argue vigorously about the definition of life .PERIOD 
They ask if it should have reproduction in it ,COMMA or metabolism ,COMMA or evolution .PERIOD 
And I don't know the answer to that ,COMMA so I'm not going to tell you .PERIOD 
I will say that life involves computation .PERIOD 
So this is a computer program .PERIOD 
Booted up in a cell ,COMMA the program would execute ,COMMA and it could result in this person ;SEMICOLON or with a small change ,COMMA it could result in this person ;SEMICOLON or another small change ,COMMA this person ;SEMICOLON or with a larger change ,COMMA this dog ,COMMA or this tree ,COMMA or this whale .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA if you take this metaphor [of] genome as program seriously ,COMMA you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact ,COMMA as is Jim Watson ,COMMA Craig Venter ,COMMA as are all of us .PERIOD 
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true ,COMMA there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you .PERIOD 
But one ,COMMA to me ,COMMA that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -DASH -DASH the output .PERIOD 
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly .PERIOD 
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be .PERIOD 
Or if you're familiar with The Princess Bride ,COMMA it could create a six-fingered man .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes .PERIOD 
If your bank account's one dollar ,COMMA and you flip a single bit ,COMMA you could end up with a thousand dollars .PERIOD 
So these small changes are things that I think that -DASH -DASH they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified ,COMMA large changes .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology ,COMMA and it shows the power of molecular programs -DASH -DASH biology does .PERIOD 
And what I want to do is write molecular programs ,COMMA potentially to build technology .PERIOD 
And there are a lot of people doing this ,COMMA a lot of synthetic biologists doing this ,COMMA like Craig Venter .PERIOD 
And they concentrate on using cells .PERIOD 
They're cell-oriented .PERIOD 
So my friends ,COMMA molecular programmers ,COMMA and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach .PERIOD 
We're interested in using DNA ,COMMA RNA and protein ,COMMA and building new languages for building things from the bottom up ,COMMA using biomolecules ,COMMA potentially having nothing to do with biology .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these are all the machines in a cell .PERIOD 
There's a camera .PERIOD 
There's the solar panels of the cell ,COMMA some switches that turn your genes on and off ,COMMA the girders of the cell ,COMMA motors that move your muscles .PERIOD 
We're not DNA zealots ,COMMA but DNA is the cheapest ,COMMA easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this .PERIOD 
And as other things become easier to use -DASH -DASH maybe protein -DASH -DASH we'll work with those .PERIOD 
If we succeed ,COMMA what will molecular programming look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
You're going to sit in front of your computer .PERIOD 
You're going to design something like a cell phone ,COMMA and in a high-level language ,COMMA you'll describe that cell phone .PERIOD 
Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed .PERIOD 
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately ,COMMA is it will do a developmental computation ,COMMA a molecular computation ,COMMA and it'll build an electronic computer .PERIOD 
And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already ,COMMA I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers ,COMMA building electronic computers ,COMMA which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers ,COMMA which will build new electronic computers ,COMMA and so forth .PERIOD 
So one big question is ,COMMA how does a baby know when to stop growing ?QUESTIONMARK 
And for molecular programming ,COMMA the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or more to the point ,COMMA how do you know if a program will ever stop ?QUESTIONMARK 
There are other questions like this ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
One of them is Craig Venter's question .PERIOD 
Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist .PERIOD 
He asked ,COMMA how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism ?QUESTIONMARK 
How few genes can I use ?QUESTIONMARK 
But for molecular programming ,COMMA our question is ,COMMA how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's the smallest number we can get away with ?QUESTIONMARK 
These are all complexity questions ,COMMA and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions .PERIOD 
Almost -DASH -DASH many of them are impossible .PERIOD 
But for some tasks ,COMMA we can start to answer them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is normal DNA ,COMMA what you think of as normal DNA .PERIOD 
It's double-stranded ,COMMA it's a double helix ,COMMA has the As ,COMMA Ts ,COMMA Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together .PERIOD 
And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes ,COMMA just so I don't scare you .PERIOD 
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix .PERIOD 
When we synthesize it ,COMMA it comes single-stranded ,COMMA so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube ,COMMA and they're floppy when they're single-stranded .PERIOD 
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix .PERIOD 
Now for the last <NUM> years ,COMMA Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together .PERIOD 
But a lot of their approaches ,COMMA though elegant ,COMMA take a long time .PERIOD 
They can take a couple of years ,COMMA or it can be difficult to design .PERIOD 
So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop .PERIOD 
But to do it ,COMMA you need a long ,COMMA single strand of DNA ,COMMA which is technically very difficult to get .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can go to a natural source .PERIOD 
You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact ,COMMA and he's got a double-stranded genome -DASH -DASH that's no good .PERIOD 
You look in his intestines .PERIOD There are billions of bacteria .PERIOD 
They're no good either .PERIOD 
Double strand again ,COMMA but inside them ,COMMA they're infected with a virus that has a nice ,COMMA long ,COMMA single-stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper .PERIOD 
And here's how we do it .PERIOD 
This is part of that genome .PERIOD 
We add a bunch of short ,COMMA synthetic DNAs that I call staples .PERIOD 
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place ,COMMA and a right half that binds it in a different place ,COMMA and brings the long strand together like this .PERIOD 
The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA we can't actually take a movie of this process ,COMMA but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it .PERIOD 
And what happens is that we mix these strands together .PERIOD 
We heat them up ,COMMA we add a little bit of salt ,COMMA we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down ,COMMA and as we cool them down ,COMMA the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure .PERIOD 
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .PERIOD 
When you look at DNA origami ,COMMA you can see that what it really is ,COMMA even though you think it's complicated ,COMMA is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other ,COMMA and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one .PERIOD 
So there's a strand that goes like this ,COMMA goes along one helix and binds -DASH -DASH it jumps to another helix and comes back .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted ,COMMA I tried to make this shape .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA I thought ,COMMA if this could work ,COMMA anything could work .PERIOD 
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this .PERIOD 
I ordered them ;SEMICOLON they came by FedEx .PERIOD 
I mixed them up ,COMMA heated them ,COMMA cooled them down ,COMMA and I got <NUM> billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water .PERIOD 
And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA they're all floating around in solution ,COMMA and to look at them ,COMMA you have to get them on a surface where they stick .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface ,COMMA and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope .PERIOD 
It feels the DNA origami .PERIOD 
There's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough .PERIOD 
When you zoom in ,COMMA they've got ,COMMA you know ,COMMA weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out ,COMMA but it's pretty good .PERIOD 
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop ,COMMA this little nano-goatee .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what's great about this is anybody can do this .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA I got this in the mail about a year after I did this ,COMMA unsolicited .PERIOD 
Anyone know what this is ?QUESTIONMARK What is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's China ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA what happened is ,COMMA a graduate student in China ,COMMA Lulu Qian ,COMMA did a great job .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA .PERIOD 
And what's really neat about it -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA this all looks like nano-artwork ,COMMA but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can put circuit components on the staples ,COMMA like a light bulb and a light switch .PERIOD 
Let the thing assemble ,COMMA and you'll get some kind of a circuit .PERIOD 
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did .PERIOD 
They took a DNA origami ,COMMA organized some carbon nano-tubes ,COMMA made a little switch ,COMMA you see here ,COMMA wired it up ,COMMA tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch .PERIOD 
But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer .PERIOD 
So it's very promising for making small computers .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I want to get back to that compiler .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you start with something in the computer .PERIOD 
You get a high-level description of the computer program ,COMMA a high-level description of the origami .PERIOD 
You can compile it to molecules ,COMMA send it to a synthesizer ,COMMA and it actually works .PERIOD 
And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code ,COMMA which was kind of ugly ,COMMA and will allow us to do this in a nice ,COMMA visual ,COMMA computer-aided design way .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now you can say ,COMMA all right ,COMMA why isn't DNA origami the end of the story ?QUESTIONMARK 
You have your molecular compiler ,COMMA you can do whatever you want .PERIOD 
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami ,COMMA the problem is ,COMMA you need a long strand that's <NUM> trillion trillion bases long .PERIOD 
That's three light years' worth of DNA ,COMMA so we're not going to do this .PERIOD 
We're going to turn to another technology ,COMMA called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles .PERIOD 
It was started by Erik Winfree ,COMMA and what it does ,COMMA it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami .PERIOD 
You zoom in ,COMMA there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles ,COMMA if they match .PERIOD 
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares .PERIOD 
And if you look at their sticky ends ,COMMA these little DNA bits ,COMMA you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these tiles would make a complicated ,COMMA self-assembling checkerboard .PERIOD 
And the point of this ,COMMA if you didn't catch that ,COMMA is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns .PERIOD 
And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs -DASH -DASH specifically ,COMMA counting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together ,COMMA form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard .PERIOD 
So you can read off binary numbers five ,COMMA six and seven .PERIOD 
And in order to get these kinds of computations started right ,COMMA you need some kind of input ,COMMA a kind of seed .PERIOD 
You can use DNA origami for that .PERIOD 
You can encode the number <NUM> in the right-hand side of a DNA origami ,COMMA and when you add those tiles that count ,COMMA they will start to count -DASH -DASH they will read that <NUM> and they'll stop at <NUM> .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going .PERIOD 
It knows when to stop growing because it can count .PERIOD 
It knows how big it is .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that answers that sort of first question I was talking about .PERIOD 
It doesn't tell us how babies do it ,COMMA however .PERIOD 
Here's the DNA origami ,COMMA and what we can do is we can write <NUM> on both edges of the DNA origami ,COMMA and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles ,COMMA and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square .PERIOD 
The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles .PERIOD 
And the neat thing about it is ,COMMA is that it's also reprogrammable .PERIOD 
And if you do that ,COMMA the origami's the same size ,COMMA but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development .PERIOD 
You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -DASH -DASH single ,COMMA tiny ,COMMA little mutations -DASH -DASH can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this -DASH -DASH using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can ask ,COMMA how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size ?QUESTIONMARK 
If we wanted to make a square of size <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA if we used DNA origami alone ,COMMA we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square ;SEMICOLON so we'd need <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or a million DNA strands .PERIOD 
That's really not affordable .PERIOD 
But if we use a little computation -DASH -DASH we use origami ,COMMA plus some tiles that count -DASH -DASH then we can get away with using <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> or <NUM> DNA strands .PERIOD 
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use ,COMMA if we use counting ,COMMA if we use a little bit of computation .PERIOD 
And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something ,COMMA to reduce the size of the genome that you're building .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers .PERIOD 
If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it ,COMMA the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory .PERIOD 
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles -DASH -DASH rather than to the staple strands ,COMMA you affix them to the tiles -DASH -DASH then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits ,COMMA the demultiplexer circuits ,COMMA that you need to address this memory .PERIOD 
So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation .PERIOD 
It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you ask me ,COMMA how far have we gotten down this path ?QUESTIONMARK 
Experimentally ,COMMA this is what we've done in the last year .PERIOD 
And you can see how they count .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five ,COMMA six ,COMMA nine ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
So it's got some errors ,COMMA but at least it counts up .PERIOD 
And I think in the next five or <NUM> years ,COMMA we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA what do I want you to take away from this talk ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms ,COMMA life uses computation to do that .PERIOD 
And the computations that it uses ,COMMA they're molecular computations ,COMMA and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it ,COMMA as Feynman said ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we need to build something to understand it .PERIOD 
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing ,COMMA rebuild everything from the bottom up ,COMMA using DNA in ways that nature never intended ,COMMA using DNA origami ,COMMA and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA so this is all very cool ,COMMA but what I'd like you to take from the talk ,COMMA hopefully from some of those big questions ,COMMA is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets .PERIOD 
It's not just making about -DASH -DASH it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits .PERIOD 
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna ,COMMA especially birds ,COMMA and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month ,COMMA and transported far from their origins ,COMMA to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo .PERIOD 
It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost <NUM> million animals every year ,COMMA a business worth almost two billion dollars .PERIOD 
The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals ,COMMA intended to supply the pet market ,COMMA or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses ,COMMA and this is how we end up ,COMMA every month ,COMMA with thousands of seized animals .PERIOD 
And for us to understand what happens with them ,COMMA we're going to follow Brad .PERIOD 
In the eyes of many people ,COMMA after the animals are seized ,COMMA they say ,COMMA Yay ,COMMA justice has been served .PERIOD 
The good guys arrived ,COMMA took the cute ,COMMA mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers ,COMMA and everyone lived happily ever after .PERIOD 
But did they ?QUESTIONMARK Actually ,COMMA no ,COMMA and this is where many of our problems begin .PERIOD 
Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .PERIOD 
In Brazil ,COMMA they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities ,COMMA in which most of the cases ,COMMA the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA these centers received <NUM> animals ,COMMA of which <NUM> were birds .PERIOD 
And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked .PERIOD 
Some lucky ones -DASH -DASH and among them ,COMMA Brad -DASH -DASH go to serious rehabilitation centers after that .PERIOD 
And in these places they are cared for .PERIOD 
They train their flying ,COMMA they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature ,COMMA and they are able to socialize with others from the same species .PERIOD 
But then what ?QUESTIONMARK 
The Brazil Ornithological Society -DASH -DASH so now we're talking only birds -DASH -DASH claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .PERIOD 
They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation .PERIOD 
Following this argument ,COMMA they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA this would mean having killed <NUM> birds ,COMMA only in the state of São Paulo ,COMMA only in <NUM> .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA some researchers ,COMMA myself included -DASH -DASH some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -DASH -DASH believe there is an alternative .PERIOD 
We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health ,COMMA behavior ,COMMA inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations ,COMMA then technically responsible releases are possible ,COMMA both for the well-being of the individual ,COMMA and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems ,COMMA because we will be returning genes for these populations -DASH -DASH which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -DASH -DASH and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers ,COMMA predators ,COMMA preys ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
All of these were released by us .PERIOD 
On the top ,COMMA the turtles are just enjoying freedom .PERIOD 
On the middle ,COMMA this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .PERIOD 
And on the bottom ,COMMA my personal favorite ,COMMA the little male over there ,COMMA four hours after his release he was together with a wild female .PERIOD 
But it's still a big issue in Brazil .PERIOD 
We believe we have performed responsible releases .PERIOD 
We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .PERIOD 
However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge .PERIOD 
I'm devoting my career to that .PERIOD 
And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach :COLON Talk to your neighbor ,COMMA teach your children ,COMMA make sure your pet is from a legal breeder .PERIOD 
We need to act ,COMMA and act now ,COMMA before these ones are the only ones left .PERIOD

My experiences over the last <NUM> months ,COMMA as a lawyer ,COMMA has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea ,COMMA which I believe is indeed worth spreading .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I share it with all of you here today ,COMMA though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan .PERIOD 
Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases .PERIOD 
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since <NUM> .PERIOD 
I've explored ,COMMA experienced ,COMMA and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content .PERIOD 
I built ,COMMA along with my two brothers ,COMMA the leading real estate company in my home state ,COMMA Kerala ,COMMA and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen ,COMMA but in their startup enterprises .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so-called social sector issues ,COMMA I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for-profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues .PERIOD 
When life brought about a series of death and near-death experiences within my close circle ,COMMA which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India ,COMMA similar to <NUM> in USA .PERIOD 
To address this ,COMMA I ,COMMA along with four friends ,COMMA founded Ambulance Access for All ,COMMA to promote life-support ambulance services in India .PERIOD 
For those from the developing world ,COMMA there is nothing ,COMMA absolutely nothing new in this idea .PERIOD 
But as we envisioned it ,COMMA we had three key goals :COLON Providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams ,COMMA and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency ,COMMA irrespective of the capability to pay .PERIOD 
The service which grew out of this ,COMMA Dial <NUM> for Ambulance ,COMMA with one ambulance in <NUM> ,COMMA now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states ,COMMA and has transported over <NUM> patients and victims since inception .PERIOD 
The service is -DASH -DASH fully self-sustainable from its own revenues ,COMMA without accessing any public funds ,COMMA and the cross-subsidy model actually works ,COMMA where the rich pays higher ,COMMA poor pays lower ,COMMA and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge .PERIOD 
The service responded effectively and efficiently ,COMMA during the unfortunate <NUM>/<NUM> Mumbai terror attacks .PERIOD 
And as you can see from the visuals ,COMMA the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike .PERIOD 
In tribute and remembrance of <NUM>/<NUM> attacks over the last one year ,COMMA we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO ,COMMA Aman Foundation ,COMMA to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi ,COMMA facilitated by Acumen Fund .PERIOD 
It's a small message from us ,COMMA in our own small way to the enemies of humanity ,COMMA of Islam ,COMMA of South Asia ,COMMA of India ,COMMA and of Pakistan ,COMMA that humanity will continue to bloom ,COMMA irrespective of such dastardly attacks .PERIOD 
Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises .PERIOD 
One is Education Access for All ,COMMA setting up schools in small-town India .PERIOD 
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right .PERIOD 
Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over <NUM> million dollars in funding .PERIOD 
With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital ,COMMA not as grant or as philanthropy .PERIOD 
Corruption ,COMMA bribes ,COMMA and lack of transparency .PERIOD 
You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks .PERIOD 
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side ,COMMA with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man .PERIOD 
And the demand side being mostly politicians ,COMMA bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them .PERIOD 
According to World Bank estimate ,COMMA one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year ,COMMA worsening the condition of the already worse off .PERIOD 
Yet ,COMMA if you analyze the common man ,COMMA he or she does not wake up every day and say ,COMMA Hmm ,COMMA let me see who I can pay a bribe to today .PERIOD 
or ,COMMA Let me see who I can corrupt today .PERIOD 
In the modern day world ,COMMA where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough ,COMMA the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life .PERIOD 
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done .PERIOD 
What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK Of course you can call the police .PERIOD 
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ?QUESTIONMARK 
Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces .PERIOD 
Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in ,COMMA pay a fee ,COMMA and fight the demand for a bribe .PERIOD 
Such a service simply do not exist .PERIOD 
One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother ,COMMA <NUM> plus years ,COMMA being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office .PERIOD 
All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house ,COMMA from ground level ,COMMA making it easier for her to enter and exit her house .PERIOD 
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe .PERIOD 
Even though it pricked my conscience then ,COMMA I could not ,COMMA or rather I did not tend to her or assist her ,COMMA because I was busy building my real estate company .PERIOD 
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement .PERIOD 
And in all <NUM> cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act ,COMMA video ,COMMA audio ,COMMA or peer pressure ,COMMA we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe .PERIOD 
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded .PERIOD 
I believe that these tools that worked in these <NUM> pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment ,COMMA and made available on web ,COMMA call-center and franchise physical offices ,COMMA for a fee ,COMMA to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe .PERIOD 
The target market is as tempting as it can get .PERIOD 
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars ,COMMA being paid in bribes every year ,COMMA or equal to India's GDP .PERIOD 
And it is an absolutely virgin market .PERIOD 
I propose to explore this idea further ,COMMA to examine the potential of creating a for-profit ,COMMA fee-based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption .PERIOD 
I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy .PERIOD 
It never has been and it never will be .PERIOD 
In my last <NUM> months as a lawyer ,COMMA battling small- and large-scale corruption ,COMMA including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster .PERIOD 
Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass ,COMMA impersonation and intimidation .PERIOD 
The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves ,COMMA our families ,COMMA our friends ,COMMA and even our kids .PERIOD 
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place .PERIOD 
What gives us the courage ?QUESTIONMARK 
As my close friend replied ,COMMA when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs ,COMMA I quote :COLON Of course we cannot fail in this ,COMMA at least in our own minds .PERIOD 
For we are insane people ,COMMA trying to do an impossible task .PERIOD 
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Shaffi ,COMMA that is a really exciting business idea .PERIOD 
Shaffi Mather :COLON I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated .PERIOD 
What's on your mind ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA give us a sense of the numbers here -DASH -DASH a typical bribe and a typical fee .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA what's in your head ?QUESTIONMARK 
So let me .. .PERIOD Let me give you an example .PERIOD 
Somebody who had applied for the passport .PERIOD 
The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around <NUM> rupees in bribes .PERIOD 
And he did not want to pay .PERIOD 
So we actually used the Right to Information Act ,COMMA which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States ,COMMA and pushed back the officers in this particular case .PERIOD 
And in all these <NUM> cases ,COMMA when we kept pushing them back ,COMMA there was three kinds of reaction .PERIOD 
Some people actually come back and say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA you want to screw me .PERIOD Let me show you what I can do .PERIOD 
And he will push us back .PERIOD 
So you take the next step ,COMMA or use the next tool available in what we are putting together ,COMMA and then he relents .PERIOD 
By the third time ,COMMA in all <NUM> cases ,COMMA we have achieved success .PERIOD 
But if it's a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-rupee ,COMMA 70-dollar bribe ,COMMA what fee would you have to charge ,COMMA and can you actually make the business work ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA actually the cost that we incurred was less than <NUM> rupees .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it actually works .PERIOD 
That's a high gross margin business .PERIOD I like it .PERIOD 
I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage .PERIOD 
OK ,COMMA so these are provisional numbers ,COMMA no pricing guarantee .PERIOD 
If you can pull this off ,COMMA you will be a global hero .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this could be huge .PERIOD 
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED .PERIOD 
In his inaugural address ,COMMA Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis .PERIOD 
But what did he appeal to ?QUESTIONMARK 
He did not ,COMMA happily ,COMMA follow in the footsteps of his predecessor ,COMMA and tell us to just go shopping .PERIOD 
Nor did he tell us ,COMMA Trust us .PERIOD Trust your country .PERIOD 
Invest ,COMMA invest ,COMMA invest .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA what he told us was to put aside childish things .PERIOD 
And he appealed to virtue .PERIOD 
Virtue is an old-fashioned word .PERIOD 
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one .PERIOD 
And besides ,COMMA some of you might be wondering ,COMMA what the hell does it mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let me begin with an example .PERIOD 
This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen .PERIOD 
And all of the items on it are unremarkable .PERIOD 
They're the things you would expect :COLON mop the floors ,COMMA sweep them ,COMMA empty the trash ,COMMA restock the cabinets .PERIOD 
It may be a little surprising how many things there are ,COMMA but it's not surprising what they are .PERIOD 
Not one .PERIOD 
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital .PERIOD 
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day ,COMMA every day who ,COMMA at this moment ,COMMA happened to be taking a nap .PERIOD 
And behavior like this from janitors ,COMMA from technicians ,COMMA from nurses and ,COMMA if we're lucky now and then ,COMMA from doctors ,COMMA doesn't just make people feel a little better ,COMMA it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA not all janitors are like this ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness ,COMMA care and empathy are an essential part of the job .PERIOD 
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings .PERIOD 
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people .PERIOD 
And beyond this ,COMMA they have the moral skill to figure out what doing right means .PERIOD 
Practical wisdom ,COMMA Aristotle told us ,COMMA is the combination of moral will and moral skill .PERIOD 
A wise person knows how to improvise ,COMMA as Luke did when he re-washed the floor .PERIOD 
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing .PERIOD 
To serve other people ,COMMA not to manipulate other people .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA perhaps most important ,COMMA a wise person is made ,COMMA not born .PERIOD 
Wisdom depends on experience ,COMMA and not just any experience .PERIOD 
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving .PERIOD 
You need permission to be allowed to improvise ,COMMA try new things ,COMMA occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures .PERIOD 
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers .PERIOD 
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job ,COMMA they tell you that it takes lots of experience .PERIOD 
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans .PERIOD 
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people .PERIOD 
At TED ,COMMA brilliance is rampant .PERIOD 
It's scary .PERIOD 
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise .PERIOD 
The bad news is that without wisdom ,COMMA brilliance isn't enough .PERIOD 
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I hope that we all know this .PERIOD 
There's a sense in which it's obvious ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA let me tell you a little story .PERIOD 
It's a story about lemonade .PERIOD 
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark .PERIOD 
His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it .PERIOD 
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade ,COMMA which was five percent alcohol .PERIOD 
So he brought it back .PERIOD 
And the kid was drinking it ,COMMA and a security guard spotted it ,COMMA and called the police ,COMMA who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark ,COMMA whisked the kid to the hospital .PERIOD 
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood .PERIOD 
But not so fast .PERIOD 
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no .PERIOD 
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days .PERIOD 
At that point ,COMMA can the child go home ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA a judge said yes ,COMMA but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel .PERIOD 
After two weeks ,COMMA I'm happy to report ,COMMA the family was reunited .PERIOD 
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing :COLON We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure .PERIOD 
How do things like this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
Scott Simon ,COMMA who told this story on NPR ,COMMA said ,COMMA Rules and procedures may be dumb ,COMMA but they spare you from thinking .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA to be fair ,COMMA rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household .PERIOD 
Fair enough .PERIOD 
One tool we reach for is rules .PERIOD 
Better ones ,COMMA more of them .PERIOD 
The second tool we reach for is incentives .PERIOD 
Better ones ,COMMA more of them .PERIOD 
What else ,COMMA after all ,COMMA is there ?QUESTIONMARK 
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .PERIOD 
Regulate ,COMMA regulate ,COMMA regulate .PERIOD 
Fix the incentives ,COMMA fix the incentives ,COMMA fix the incentives .. .PERIOD 
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job .PERIOD 
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ?QUESTIONMARK 
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's preposterous on its face .PERIOD 
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules ,COMMA rules and incentives may make things better in the short run ,COMMA but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run .PERIOD 
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations .PERIOD 
And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing .PERIOD 
And without intending it ,COMMA by appealing to rules and incentives ,COMMA we are engaging in a war on wisdom .PERIOD 
Let me just give you a few examples ,COMMA first of rules and the war on moral skill .PERIOD 
The lemonade story is one .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA no doubt more familiar to you ,COMMA is the nature of modern American education :COLON scripted ,COMMA lock-step curricula .PERIOD 
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten .PERIOD 
Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with 'B.' The Bath :COLON Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water .PERIOD 
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city ,COMMA every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .PERIOD 
We know why these scripts are there .PERIOD 
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own .PERIOD 
And they prevent disaster .PERIOD 
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity .PERIOD 
Don't get me wrong .PERIOD We need rules !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising .PERIOD 
And as a result ,COMMA they lose their gifts ,COMMA or worse ,COMMA they stop playing altogether .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA how about incentives ?QUESTIONMARK 
They seem cleverer .PERIOD 
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing ,COMMA it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it .PERIOD 
Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA not always .PERIOD 
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting ,COMMA and they make people less likely to do it .PERIOD 
I'll just give you one example because time is racing .PERIOD 
In Switzerland ,COMMA back about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps .PERIOD 
There was going to be a national referendum .PERIOD 
And they said ,COMMA Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ?QUESTIONMARK 
Astonishingly ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the citizens said yes .PERIOD 
They knew it was dangerous .PERIOD 
They thought it would reduce their property values .PERIOD 
But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens .PERIOD 
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question .PERIOD 
Two reasons .PERIOD It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid .PERIOD 
Instead of <NUM> percent saying yes ,COMMA <NUM> percent said yes .PERIOD 
What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking ,COMMA What is my responsibility ?QUESTIONMARK 
all we ask is ,COMMA What serves my interests ?QUESTIONMARK 
When incentives don't work ,COMMA when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses ,COMMA the response is always the same .PERIOD 
Get smarter incentives .PERIOD 
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough .PERIOD 
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will .PERIOD 
We need incentives .PERIOD People have to make a living .PERIOD 
But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word .PERIOD 
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality .PERIOD 
Barack Obama said ,COMMA before he was inaugurated ,COMMA We must ask not just 'Is it profitable ?QUESTIONMARK ' but 'Is it right ?QUESTIONMARK ' And when professions are demoralized ,COMMA everyone in them becomes dependent on -DASH -DASH addicted to -DASH -DASH incentives and they stop asking Is it right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we certainly see it in the world of business .PERIOD 
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work .PERIOD 
So what can we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
A few sources of hope :COLON we ought to try to re-moralize work .PERIOD 
One way not to do it :COLON teach more ethics courses .PERIOD 
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course .PERIOD 
What to do instead ?QUESTIONMARK 
One :COLON Celebrate moral exemplars .PERIOD 
Acknowledge ,COMMA when you go to law school ,COMMA that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch .PERIOD 
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions .PERIOD 
People are inspired by moral heroes .PERIOD 
But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA acknowledge them .PERIOD 
Be proud that you have them .PERIOD 
Celebrate them .PERIOD 
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .PERIOD 
That's one thing we can do .PERIOD 
<NUM> employees .PERIOD He kept every one of them on the payroll .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go .PERIOD 
Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street ,COMMA but I can tell you it's worth more .PERIOD We're doing fine .PERIOD 
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes .PERIOD 
Two were particularly inspiring to me .PERIOD 
One was Ray Anderson ,COMMA who turned -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH turned ,COMMA you know ,COMMA a part of the evil empire into a zero-footprint ,COMMA or almost zero-footprint business .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because it was the right thing to do .PERIOD 
His employees are inspired by the effort .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do .PERIOD 
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia .PERIOD 
Because it took the will to do the right thing .PERIOD 
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill .PERIOD 
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out .PERIOD 
But most important to make it work -DASH -DASH and he emphasized this -DASH -DASH is that it took knowing the people in the communities .PERIOD 
Unless the people you're working with are behind you ,COMMA this will fail .PERIOD 
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you ,COMMA because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways .PERIOD 
And you don't have to be a mega-hero .PERIOD 
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .PERIOD 
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary ,COMMA if not extraordinary heroes .PERIOD 
As heads of organizations ,COMMA we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will .PERIOD 
If you run an organization ,COMMA you should be sure that none of the jobs -DASH -DASH none of the jobs -DASH -DASH have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors .PERIOD 
Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA perhaps most important ,COMMA as teachers ,COMMA we should strive to be the ordinary heroes ,COMMA the moral exemplars ,COMMA to the people we mentor .PERIOD 
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers .PERIOD 
One is that we are always teaching .PERIOD 
Someone is always watching .PERIOD 
The camera is always on .PERIOD 
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA the model that KIPP was providing :COLON Knowledge is power .PERIOD 
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college .PERIOD 
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill didn't mention .PERIOD 
That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character .PERIOD 
They need to learn to respect themselves .PERIOD 
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates .PERIOD 
They need to learn to respect their teachers .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA most important ,COMMA they need to learn to respect learning .PERIOD 
That's the principle objective .PERIOD 
If you do that ,COMMA the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill .PERIOD 
And the teachers :COLON the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day .PERIOD 
Obama appealed to virtue .PERIOD 
And I think he was right .PERIOD 
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom ,COMMA because it's what allows other virtues -DASH -DASH honesty ,COMMA kindness ,COMMA courage and so on -DASH -DASH to be displayed at the right time and in the right way .PERIOD 
He also appealed to hope .PERIOD 
Right again .PERIOD 
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .PERIOD 
In many ways ,COMMA it's what TED is all about .PERIOD 
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons .PERIOD 
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention .PERIOD 
Paying attention to what we do ,COMMA to how we do it ,COMMA and ,COMMA perhaps most importantly ,COMMA to the structure of the organizations within which we work ,COMMA so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON You have to go and stand out here a sec .PERIOD 
Barry Schwartz :COLON Thank you very much .PERIOD 
It's not about technology ,COMMA it's about people and stories .PERIOD 
I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video :COLON <NUM> Minutes ,COMMA many of you may have seen it .PERIOD 
And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran's administration -DASH -DASH who ,COMMA himself ,COMMA had lost an arm <NUM> years ago in Vietnam -DASH -DASH who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work .PERIOD 
And it turns out that with <NUM> Minutes cameras rolling in the background ,COMMA after he pretty much made his position clear on this -DASH -DASH he had his hook and he had his -DASH -DASH he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that ,COMMA quote -DASH -DASH his quote -DASH -DASH it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story ,COMMA and I'm not going to show you that polished video .PERIOD 
I'm going to ,COMMA instead ,COMMA in a minute or two ,COMMA show you an early ,COMMA crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story .PERIOD 
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .PERIOD 
I get this sort of unrequested -DASH -DASH by me anyway -DASH -DASH visit ,COMMA and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA .PERIOD 
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following .PERIOD We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers :COLON hills of Afghanistan ,COMMA Iraq .. .PERIOD 
They were quite proud of the fact that you know ,COMMA before the dust clears ,COMMA if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her ,COMMA they will have brought him back ,COMMA they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States .PERIOD 
That's the good news .PERIOD 
The bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg ,COMMA part of the face ,COMMA it's probably not coming back .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm .PERIOD 
And then the surgeon pointed out ,COMMA with a lot of anger ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Why is it ?QUESTIONMARK At the end of the Civil War ,COMMA they were shooting each other with muskets .PERIOD If somebody lost an arm ,COMMA we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it .PERIOD 
And they basically said ,COMMA This is unacceptable ,COMMA and then the punchline :COLON So ,COMMA Dean ,COMMA we're here because you make medical stuff .PERIOD 
You're going to give us an arm .PERIOD 
And I was waiting for the <NUM> pages of bureaucracy ,COMMA paperwork and DODs .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA the guy says ,COMMA We're going to bring a guy into this conference room ,COMMA and wearing the arm you're going to give us ,COMMA he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table .PERIOD 
If it's the grape ,COMMA they won't break it .PERIOD 
Great he needs efferent ,COMMA afferent ,COMMA haptic response sensors .PERIOD 
So he wants fine motor control :COLON flex at the wrist ,COMMA flex at the elbow ,COMMA abduct and flex at the shoulder .PERIOD 
Either way they were going to eat it .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA by the way Dean .PERIOD It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -DASH -DASH namely <NUM> inches from the long finger -DASH -DASH and weigh less than nine pounds .PERIOD 
50th percentile female frame .PERIOD 
And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they finished that .PERIOD And I ,COMMA as you can tell ,COMMA am a bashful guy .PERIOD 
They've been watching too much Terminator .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA the surgeon says to me ,COMMA Dean ,COMMA you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I cannot imagine -DASH -DASH I'm sorry ,COMMA you may have a better imagination than I do -DASH -DASH I can't imagine losing my arm ,COMMA and typically at <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
But compared to that ,COMMA losing two ?QUESTIONMARK 
Seems like that would be an inconvenience .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA I went home that night .PERIOD I thought about it .PERIOD 
I literally could not sleep thinking about ,COMMA I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I decided we've got to do this .PERIOD 
And trust me ,COMMA I've got a day job ,COMMA I've got a lot of day jobs .PERIOD 
Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ... .PERIOD 
And I've got a lot of day jobs .PERIOD 
But I figured I gotta do this .PERIOD 
Did a little investigation ,COMMA went down to Washington ,COMMA told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it .PERIOD 
And I told them I'd build them an arm .PERIOD 
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA ,COMMA and probably <NUM> years to be reasonably functional .PERIOD 
Look what it takes to make things like iPods .PERIOD 
Great ,COMMA he said ,COMMA You got two years .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA I'll tell you what .PERIOD I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year .PERIOD 
We sort of agreed to disagree .PERIOD 
At the end of exactly one year we had a device with <NUM> degrees of freedom ,COMMA all the sensors ,COMMA all the microprocessors ,COMMA all the stuff inside .PERIOD 
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie ,COMMA but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff .PERIOD 
I then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really ,COMMA really useful .PERIOD 
It turned out ,COMMA as I think you could see in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes ,COMMA people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA with less than <NUM> hours of use ,COMMA two guys -DASH -DASH one that's bilateral .PERIOD 
He's literally ,COMMA he's got no shoulder on one side ,COMMA and he's high trans-humeral on the other .PERIOD 
And that's Chuck and Randy together ,COMMA after <NUM> hours -DASH -DASH were playing in our office .PERIOD 
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies .PERIOD 
At the end of the one I'm going to show ,COMMA it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long ,COMMA Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of ,COMMA I can't do it .PERIOD 
He picks up a spoon ,COMMA picks it up ,COMMA scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk ,COMMA holds the spoon level as he translates it ,COMMA moving all these joints simultaneously ,COMMA to his mouth ,COMMA and he doesn't drop any milk .PERIOD 
I cannot do that .PERIOD 
His wife was standing behind me .PERIOD 
She's standing behind me at the time and she says ,COMMA Dean ,COMMA Chuck hasn't fed himself in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you've got a choice :COLON We keep the arm ,COMMA or you keep Chuck .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA can we see that ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints .PERIOD 
He's punching our controls guy .PERIOD The guy behind him is our engineer/surgeon ,COMMA which is a convenient guy to have around .PERIOD 
There's Randy ,COMMA these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them .PERIOD 
And just as in the spirit of FIRST ,COMMA gracious professionalism ,COMMA they are quite proud of this ,COMMA so they decide to share a drink .PERIOD 
This is a non-trivial thing to do ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it ,COMMA doing either of those .PERIOD 
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary ,COMMA at least for my limited physical skill .PERIOD 
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for .PERIOD 
He's going to pick up a grape -DASH -DASH he didn't drop it ,COMMA he didn't break it -DASH -DASH and he's going to eat it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's where we were at the end of about <NUM> months .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA as I've learned from Richard ,COMMA the technology ,COMMA the processors ,COMMA the sensors ,COMMA the motors ,COMMA is not the story .PERIOD 
I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly ,COMMA this whole segment of the medical world .PERIOD 
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this .PERIOD 
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design ,COMMA and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make -DASH -DASH you can always get three out of four of anything you want ;SEMICOLON the weight ,COMMA the size ,COMMA the cost ,COMMA the functionality -DASH -DASH I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said ,COMMA We're flying down to Walter Reed ,COMMA and we're going talk to these kids ,COMMA because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm .PERIOD 
It doesn't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm .PERIOD 
When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic ,COMMA but I told them ,COMMA It really doesn't matter what their opinion is .PERIOD 
There is only one opinion that matters ,COMMA the kids that are either going to use it or not .PERIOD 
I told a bunch of my engineers ,COMMA Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed ,COMMA and you're going to see people ,COMMA lots of them ,COMMA missing major body parts .PERIOD 
They're probably going to be angry ,COMMA depressed ,COMMA frustrated .PERIOD 
We're probably going to have to give them support ,COMMA encouragement .PERIOD 
But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing .PERIOD 
We did see a bunch of people ,COMMA a lot of them missing a lot of body parts ,COMMA and parts they had left were burned ;SEMICOLON half a face gone ,COMMA an ear burned off .PERIOD 
They were sitting at a table .PERIOD They were brought together for us .PERIOD 
And we started asking them all questions .PERIOD 
Look ,COMMA I'd say to them ,COMMA We're not quite as good as nature yet .PERIOD 
I could give you fine motor control ,COMMA or I could let you curl <NUM> pounds ;SEMICOLON I probably can't do both .PERIOD 
And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them .PERIOD 
Not only were they enthusiastic ,COMMA they kept thinking they're there to help us .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA would it help if I .. .PERIOD 
Guys ,COMMA and woman ,COMMA you've given enough .PERIOD 
We're here to help you .PERIOD We need data .PERIOD We need to know what you need .PERIOD 
After a half an hour ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much .PERIOD 
You could see he was missing an arm .PERIOD 
He was leaning on his other arm .PERIOD 
I called down to the end ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA you haven't said much .PERIOD 
If we needed this or this ,COMMA what would you want ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I'm the lucky guy at this table .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he wouldn't say much .PERIOD 
He had a great spirit ,COMMA like all the rest of them had great spirits .PERIOD 
And he made a few comments .PERIOD 
And then the meeting ended .PERIOD We said goodbye to all these guys .PERIOD 
And that guy pushed himself back from the table .. .PERIOD 
he has no legs .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we left .PERIOD 
And I was thinking ,COMMA We didn't give them support and encouragement ;SEMICOLON they gave it to us .PERIOD 
They're not finished giving yet .PERIOD 
It was astounding .PERIOD 
And I started working harder ,COMMA faster .PERIOD 
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center .PERIOD 
And we saw lots of these kids ,COMMA lots of them .PERIOD 
And it was astounding how positive they are .PERIOD 
We're in clinical trials ,COMMA we've got five of them on people .PERIOD 
We're screaming along .PERIOD 
And I get a call and we go back to Washington .PERIOD 
We go back to Walter Reed ,COMMA and a kid ,COMMA literally ,COMMA <NUM> some-odd days before that was blown up .PERIOD 
And they shipped him to Germany and <NUM> hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed .PERIOD 
And I went down and they rolled him into a room .PERIOD 
He's got no legs .PERIOD 
He's got a small residual limb on one side .PERIOD 
Half of his face is gone ,COMMA but they said his vision is coming back .PERIOD 
He had one good eye .PERIOD 
His name is Brandon Marrocco .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA I need your arms ,COMMA but I need two of them .PERIOD 
You'll get them .PERIOD 
This kid was from Staten Island .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA I had a truck ,COMMA before I went over there ,COMMA and it had a stick .PERIOD 
You think I'll be able to drive it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Sure .PERIOD 
And I turned around and went ,COMMA How are we going to do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Anyway ,COMMA he was just like all the rest of them .PERIOD 
He doesn't really want a lot .PERIOD 
He wants to help .PERIOD He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I was on my way out here .PERIOD 
I was asked to stop at Texas .PERIOD 
There were <NUM> people ,COMMA the Veteran's Administration ,COMMA U.S .PERIOD .. .PERIOD just <NUM> at this huge event to help the families of all the kids -DASH -DASH some that have died ,COMMA some that are like Brandon -DASH -DASH and they wanted me to speak .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA What am I going to say ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is not a happy thing .PERIOD Look ,COMMA if this happens to you ,COMMA I can give you .. .PERIOD This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment .PERIOD 
You need to come .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I went .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as I think you get the point ,COMMA there were a lot people there recovering .PERIOD 
Some further along than others .PERIOD 
But universally ,COMMA these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes ,COMMA and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them .PERIOD 
I'll shut up ,COMMA except one message or concern I have .PERIOD 
I don't think anybody does it intentionally ,COMMA but there were people there literally talking about ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how much will they get ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA this country is involved as we've all heard ,COMMA in this great healthcare debate .PERIOD 
Who is entitled to what ?QUESTIONMARK 
Who is entitled to how much ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't have an answer to that .PERIOD Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here .PERIOD 
It's not possible .PERIOD It would be nice but let's be realistic .PERIOD 
They were tough questions .PERIOD There's polarized groups down there .PERIOD 
There are other questions that are tough .PERIOD 
Should we be there ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do we get out ?QUESTIONMARK 
Those are political questions ,COMMA economic questions ,COMMA strategic questions .PERIOD 
I don't have the answer .PERIOD But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement ,COMMA then .PERIOD 
It is an easy answer .PERIOD 
I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side .PERIOD 
I was talking to one of them ,COMMA and he was really liking this arm -DASH -DASH it's way ,COMMA way ,COMMA way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it -DASH -DASH but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .PERIOD 
But I was saying to him ,COMMA You know ,COMMA the first airplane went <NUM> feet in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Wilbur and Orville .PERIOD 
But you know what ?QUESTIONMARK It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous .PERIOD 
But now we got Eagles out there ,COMMA F15s ,COMMA even that Bald Eagle .PERIOD 
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach <NUM> .PERIOD 
And I said to that kid ,COMMA I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do ,COMMA and how it does it .PERIOD 
And we'll keep working .PERIOD And I'm not going to stop working until we do that .PERIOD 
And I think this country ought to continue its great debate ,COMMA whining and complaining ,COMMA I'm entitled .PERIOD You're a victim .PERIOD 
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get ,COMMA the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining ,COMMA I know what they deserve :COLON everything humanly possible .PERIOD 
As a magician ,COMMA I try to create images that make people stop and think .PERIOD 
I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .PERIOD 
I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin ,COMMA buried alive in a coffin in April ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA for a week .PERIOD 
I lived there with nothing but water .PERIOD 
And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things .PERIOD 
The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City .PERIOD 
The one after that ,COMMA I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA next I went to London .PERIOD 
In London I lived in a glass box for <NUM> days with nothing but water .PERIOD 
It was ,COMMA for me ,COMMA one of the most difficult things I'd ever done ,COMMA but it was also the most beautiful .PERIOD 
There was so many skeptics ,COMMA especially the press in London ,COMMA that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science .PERIOD 
My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing ,COMMA like how long I could survive with nothing ,COMMA not even air .PERIOD 
I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life .PERIOD 
As a young magician I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I began ,COMMA early on ,COMMA competing against the other kids ,COMMA seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe ,COMMA you know ,COMMA five times ,COMMA while I stayed under on one breath .PERIOD 
By the time I was a teenager I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record .PERIOD 
In <NUM> I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .PERIOD 
He was underneath ,COMMA not breathing for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
His core temperature had dropped to <NUM> degrees .PERIOD 
As a magician ,COMMA I think everything is possible .PERIOD 
And I think if something is done by one person it can be done by others .PERIOD 
I started to think ,COMMA if the boy could survive without breathing for that long ,COMMA there must be a way that I could do it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I met with a top neurosurgeon .PERIOD 
And I asked him ,COMMA how long is it possible to go without breathing ,COMMA like how long could I go without air ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage .PERIOD 
My first try ,COMMA I figured that I could do something similar ,COMMA and I created a water tank ,COMMA and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water .PERIOD 
And I was shivering .PERIOD In my first attempt to hold my breath I couldn't even last a minute .PERIOD 
I want to hold my breath for a really long time .PERIOD How could it be done ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA David ,COMMA you're a magician ,COMMA create the illusion of not breathing ,COMMA it will be much easier .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather ,COMMA with a CO2 scrubber ,COMMA which was basically a tube from Home Depot ,COMMA with a balloon duct-taped to it ,COMMA that he thought we could put inside of me ,COMMA and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me .PERIOD 
This is a little hard to watch .PERIOD 
But this is that attempt .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that clearly wasn't going to work .PERIOD 
There is a chemical that's called perflubron .PERIOD 
And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I got my hands on that chemical ,COMMA filled the sink up with it ,COMMA and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in ,COMMA which was really impossible .PERIOD 
It's basically like trying to breathe ,COMMA as a doctor said ,COMMA while having an elephant standing on your chest .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that idea disappeared .PERIOD 
Then I started thinking ,COMMA would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery ,COMMA and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which was another insane idea ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD 
Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas :COLON to actually do it .PERIOD 
To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I started researching into pearl divers .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA because they go down for four minutes on one breath .PERIOD 
And when I was researching pearl divers ,COMMA I found the world of free-diving .PERIOD 
It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered ,COMMA pretty much .PERIOD 
There is many different aspects to free-diving .PERIOD 
There is depth records ,COMMA where people go as deep as they can .PERIOD 
And then there is static apnea .PERIOD 
That's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving .PERIOD 
That was the one that I studied .PERIOD 
The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath you should never move at all ;SEMICOLON that wastes energy .PERIOD 
And that depletes oxygen ,COMMA and it builds up CO2 in your blood .PERIOD So ,COMMA I learned never to move .PERIOD 
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD 
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body ,COMMA and just control that .PERIOD 
And then I learned how to purge .PERIOD 
Purging is basically hyperventilating .PERIOD 
You do that ,COMMA you get lightheaded ,COMMA you get tingling .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when you hold your breath it's infinitely easier .PERIOD 
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath ,COMMA and just hold and relax and never let any air out ,COMMA and just hold and relax through all the pain .PERIOD 
Every morning ,COMMA this is for months ,COMMA I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for ,COMMA out of <NUM> minutes ,COMMA I would hold my breath for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA basically what that means is I would purge ,COMMA I'd breath really hard for a minute .PERIOD 
And I would hold ,COMMA immediately after ,COMMA for five and half minutes .PERIOD 
Then I would breath again for a minute ,COMMA purging as hard as I can ,COMMA then immediately after that I would hold again for five and half minutes .PERIOD 
I would repeat this process eight times in a row .PERIOD 
Out of <NUM> minutes you're only breathing for eight minutes .PERIOD 
At the end of that you're completely fried ,COMMA your brain .PERIOD 
You feel like you're walking around in a daze .PERIOD 
And you have these awful headaches .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff .PERIOD 
I started learning about the world-record holder .PERIOD 
His name is Tom Sietas .PERIOD 
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath .PERIOD 
He's six foot four .PERIOD He's <NUM> pounds .PERIOD 
I'm six foot one ,COMMA and fat .PERIOD 
We'll say big-boned .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA everything that I put into my body I considered as medicine .PERIOD 
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day .PERIOD 
The thinner I was ,COMMA the longer I was able to hold my breath .PERIOD 
And by eating so well and training so hard ,COMMA my resting heart-rate dropped to <NUM> beats per minute .PERIOD 
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes .PERIOD 
In four months of training I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes .PERIOD 
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere .PERIOD 
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress .PERIOD 
I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime-time television .PERIOD 
The world record was eight minutes and <NUM> seconds ,COMMA held by Tom Sietas ,COMMA that guy with the whale lungs I told you about .PERIOD 
I was completely wrong .PERIOD 
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date .PERIOD 
Two days before my big breath hold attempt ,COMMA for the record ,COMMA the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath ,COMMA and almost drowning ,COMMA is too boring for television .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I had to add handcuffs ,COMMA while holding my breath ,COMMA to escape from .PERIOD 
This was a critical mistake .PERIOD 
Because of the movement I was wasting oxygen .PERIOD 
By <NUM> :COLON <NUM> I started to black out .PERIOD 
And by seven minutes and <NUM> seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back .PERIOD 
I had failed on every level .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA the only way out of the slump that I could think of was ,COMMA I decided to call Oprah .PERIOD 
I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA basically you breath pure O2 first ,COMMA oxygenating your body ,COMMA flushing out CO2 ,COMMA and you are able to hold much longer .PERIOD 
I realized that my real competition was the beaver .PERIOD 
In January of '<NUM> Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's like base camp Everest .PERIOD 
What that does is ,COMMA you start building up the red blood cell count in your body ,COMMA which helps you carry oxygen better .PERIOD 
Every morning ,COMMA again ,COMMA after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out .PERIOD 
My first attempt on pure O2 ,COMMA I was able to go up to <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it was a pretty big success .PERIOD 
The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind ,COMMA at <NUM> minutes your brain is done ,COMMA you're brain dead .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he pulled me up ,COMMA and I was fine .PERIOD 
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed .PERIOD 
It was my ex-girlfriend .PERIOD While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time ,COMMA she was sifting through my Blackberry ,COMMA checking all my messages .PERIOD 
My brother had a picture of it .PERIOD It is really .. .PERIOD 
I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record ,COMMA publicly .PERIOD 
And what he did in response ,COMMA is he went on Regis and Kelly ,COMMA and broke his old record .PERIOD 
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA he suddenly pushed the record up to <NUM> minutes and <NUM> seconds .PERIOD 
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it was longer than the record .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I wanted to get the Science Times to document this .PERIOD 
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do .PERIOD 
I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I don't know if it was the magic or the lore of the Cayman islands ,COMMA but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding .PERIOD 
While he was there I tried to impress him ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
And I did a dive down to <NUM> feet ,COMMA which is basically the height of a <NUM> story building ,COMMA and as I was coming up ,COMMA I blacked out underwater ,COMMA which is really dangerous ;SEMICOLON that's how you drown .PERIOD 
Luckily Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I started full focus .PERIOD 
I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do .PERIOD 
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it ,COMMA being on Oprah .PERIOD 
But in practice ,COMMA I would do it face down ,COMMA floating on the pool .PERIOD 
The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose ,COMMA which was a real problem for me .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA what they also did was ,COMMA which we never did before ,COMMA is there was a heart-rate monitor .PERIOD 
And it was right next to the sphere .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA every time my heart would beat I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the ticking ,COMMA really loud .PERIOD 
Which was making me more nervous .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA normally I would start at <NUM> beats per minute ,COMMA and while holding my breath it would drop to <NUM> beats per minute ,COMMA which is pretty unusual .PERIOD 
This time it started at <NUM> beats ,COMMA and it never went down .PERIOD 
I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down .PERIOD 
I was just sitting there thinking ,COMMA I've got to slow this down .PERIOD 
I'm going to fail ,COMMA I'm going to fail .PERIOD 
And I was getting more nervous .PERIOD 
And the heart rate just kept going up and up ,COMMA all the way up to <NUM> beats .PERIOD 
Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center .PERIOD 
It was a waste of O2 .PERIOD 
When I made it to the halfway mark ,COMMA at eight minutes ,COMMA I was <NUM> percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this .PERIOD 
There was no way for me to do it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I figured ,COMMA Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing ,COMMA if I had cracked early it would be a whole show about how depressed I am .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out ,COMMA at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that .PERIOD 
I kept pushing to <NUM> minutes .PERIOD At <NUM> minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes .PERIOD 
And I knew that that was blood shunting ,COMMA when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs .PERIOD 
At <NUM> minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs ,COMMA and my lips started to feel really strange .PERIOD 
At minute <NUM> I started to have ringing in my ears ,COMMA and I started to feel my arm going numb .PERIOD 
And I'm a hypochondriac ,COMMA and I remember arm numb means heart attack .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I started to really get really paranoid .PERIOD 
Then at <NUM> minutes ,COMMA maybe because of the hypochondria .PERIOD 
I started feeling pains all over my chest .PERIOD 
It was awful .PERIOD 
At <NUM> minutes ,COMMA I had these awful contractions ,COMMA like this urge to breathe .PERIOD 
At <NUM> minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart .PERIOD 
It would skip a beat .PERIOD 
It would start .PERIOD It would stop .PERIOD And I felt all this .PERIOD 
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA at <NUM> minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out ,COMMA if I did have a heart attack ,COMMA they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up .PERIOD So ,COMMA I was really nervous .PERIOD 
And I didn't take my head out .PERIOD 
But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop ,COMMA just waiting .PERIOD 
And then suddenly I hear screaming .PERIOD 
And I think that there is some weird thing -DASH -DASH that I had died or something had happened .PERIOD 
And then I realized that I had made it to <NUM> :COLON <NUM> .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA with the energy of everybody that was there I decided to keep pushing .PERIOD 
And I went to <NUM> minutes and four seconds .PERIOD 
As though that wasn't enough ,COMMA what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were ,COMMA so the doctors could use it ,COMMA once again .PERIOD 
I also didn't want anybody to question it .PERIOD 
I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I get to New York City the next day ,COMMA and this kid walks up to me -DASH -DASH I'm walking out of the Apple store -DASH -DASH this kid walks up to me he's like ,COMMA Yo ,COMMA D !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I'm like Yeah ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA If you really held your breath that long ,COMMA why'd you come out of the water dry ?QUESTIONMARK 
I was like What ?QUESTIONMARK 
And that's my life .PERIOD So .. .PERIOD 
And I think magic ,COMMA whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards ,COMMA is pretty simple .PERIOD 
It's practice ,COMMA it's training ,COMMA and it's -DASH -DASH It's practice ,COMMA it's training and experimenting ,COMMA while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be .PERIOD 
And that's what magic is to me ,COMMA so ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
Great creativity .PERIOD In times of need ,COMMA we need great creativity .PERIOD 
Discuss .PERIOD Great creativity is astonishingly ,COMMA absurdly ,COMMA rationally ,COMMA irrationally powerful .PERIOD 
Great creativity can spread tolerance ,COMMA champion freedom ,COMMA make education seem like a bright idea .PERIOD 
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation ,COMMA or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so .PERIOD 
Great creativity can make politicians electable ,COMMA or parties unelectable .PERIOD 
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .PERIOD 
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .PERIOD 
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .PERIOD 
Science is clever ,COMMA but great creativity is something less knowable ,COMMA more magical .PERIOD And now we need that magic .PERIOD 
This is a time of need .PERIOD 
Our climate is changing quickly ,COMMA too quickly .PERIOD 
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well :COLON to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .PERIOD 
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .PERIOD 
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .PERIOD 
Man :COLON You know ,COMMA rather than drive today ,COMMA I'm going to walk .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON And so he walked ,COMMA and as he walked he saw things .PERIOD 
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .PERIOD 
A deer with an itchy leg .PERIOD A flying motorcycle .PERIOD 
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .PERIOD 
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA she had aged a lot .PERIOD 
But he felt all his old passion for her return .PERIOD 
Ford ,COMMA he called softly .PERIOD For that was her name .PERIOD 
Don't say another word ,COMMA Gusty ,COMMA she said ,COMMA for that was his name .PERIOD 
I know a tent next to a caravan ,COMMA exactly <NUM> yards from here .PERIOD 
Let's go there and make love .PERIOD In the tent .PERIOD 
Ford undressed .PERIOD She spread one leg ,COMMA and then the other .PERIOD 
The earth moved for both of them .PERIOD

And all because he decided to walk that day .PERIOD 
Andy Hobsbawm :COLON We've got the science ,COMMA we've had the debate .PERIOD 
The moral imperative is on the table .PERIOD

So this is a call ,COMMA a plea ,COMMA to the incredibly talented TED community .PERIOD 
Let's get creative against climate change .PERIOD

A public ,COMMA Dewey long ago observed ,COMMA is constituted through discussion and debate .PERIOD 
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question ,COMMA and avoid doxa ,COMMA the realm of the unquestioned ,COMMA then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion .PERIOD 
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time ,COMMA namely ,COMMA how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building .PERIOD 
To put the assumptions very clearly :COLON capitalism ,COMMA after <NUM> years ,COMMA has become acceptable ,COMMA and so has democracy .PERIOD 
If we looked in the world of <NUM> and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities ,COMMA they were the rare exception ,COMMA not the norm .PERIOD 
The question now ,COMMA however ,COMMA is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation .PERIOD 
But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions .PERIOD 
And it is necessary ,COMMA no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus ,COMMA to be able to move forward .PERIOD 
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems .PERIOD 
Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive ,COMMA as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights ,COMMA about denial of justice ,COMMA rather than provision of it .PERIOD 
And in terms of experience of capitalism ,COMMA there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA extractive industry .PERIOD 
Blood diamonds ,COMMA smuggled emeralds ,COMMA timber ,COMMA that is cut right from under the poorest .PERIOD 
Second is technical assistance .PERIOD 
And technical assistance might shock you ,COMMA but it's the worst form of -DASH -DASH today -DASH -DASH of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries .PERIOD 
Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to <NUM> dollars a day ,COMMA who are incapable of thinking creatively ,COMMA or organically .PERIOD 
Next assumption -DASH -DASH and of course the events of July <NUM> ,COMMA I express my deep sympathy ,COMMA and before that ,COMMA September <NUM> -DASH -DASH have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds .PERIOD 
We live in one world .PERIOD 
But that's easily said .PERIOD 
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in .PERIOD 
And that is that if we want to have one world ,COMMA this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion ,COMMA and then inclusion for some .PERIOD 
We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world ,COMMA in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope .PERIOD 
Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history ,COMMA where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics .PERIOD 
What is one of these organizations to pick ?QUESTIONMARK 
I will not deal with those first two ,COMMA except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions ,COMMA from one context to another ,COMMA can only make for disaster .PERIOD 
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context .PERIOD 
My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia .PERIOD 
Textbook economics does not work in my context ,COMMA and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy .PERIOD 
The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward ,COMMA and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling ,COMMA for which I have enormous respect .PERIOD 
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state ,COMMA why don't we simplify and say ,COMMA what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform ?QUESTIONMARK 
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this ;SEMICOLON we hope to share that much widely with -DASH -DASH and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places .PERIOD 
So what are these functions ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence ,COMMA administrative control ,COMMA management of public finances ,COMMA investment in human capital ,COMMA provision of citizenship rights ,COMMA provision of infrastructure ,COMMA management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation ,COMMA creation of the market ,COMMA international agreements ,COMMA including public borrowing ,COMMA and then ,COMMA most importantly ,COMMA rule of law .PERIOD 
I won't elaborate .PERIOD 
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity .PERIOD 
This is a feasible goal ,COMMA basically because ,COMMA contrary to widespread assumption ,COMMA I would argue that we know how to do this .PERIOD 
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today ,COMMA if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning .PERIOD 
And there are lots of other examples .PERIOD 
Now in order to do this -DASH -DASH and this brings this group -DASH -DASH we have to rethink the notion of capital .PERIOD 
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries .PERIOD 
It's just cash .PERIOD 
Because it lacks the institutional ,COMMA organizational ,COMMA managerial forms to turn it into capital .PERIOD 
And what is required is a combination of physical capital ,COMMA institutional capital ,COMMA human capital -DASH -DASH and security ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is critical ,COMMA but so is information .PERIOD 
It takes <NUM> years to produce somebody with a Ph.D .PERIOD 
The first challenge is to rethink ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA the issue of the time .PERIOD 
Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited ?QUESTIONMARK 
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century .PERIOD 
What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re-engage in a project ,COMMA that capital formation is rapid ?QUESTIONMARK 
The absolute majority of the world's population are below <NUM> ,COMMA and they are growing larger and faster .PERIOD 
They need different ways of being approached ,COMMA different ways of being enfranchised ,COMMA different ways of being skilled .PERIOD 
And that's the first thing .PERIOD 
Second is ,COMMA you're problem solvers ,COMMA but you're not engaging your global responsibility .PERIOD 
You've stayed away from the problems of corruption .PERIOD 
You only want clean environments in which to function .PERIOD 
But if you don't think through the problems of corruption ,COMMA who will ?QUESTIONMARK 
You stay away from design for development .PERIOD 
You're great designers ,COMMA but your designs are selfish .PERIOD 
It's for your own immediate use .PERIOD 
The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads ,COMMA or dams ,COMMA or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in <NUM> years .PERIOD 
This is not right .PERIOD It requires thinking .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work .PERIOD 
As the work on paradigms ,COMMA long time ago showed -DASH -DASH Thomas Kuhn's work -DASH -DASH it's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -DASH -DASH true breakthroughs -DASH -DASH occur .PERIOD 
And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor ,COMMA through this means .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON So ,COMMA Ashraf ,COMMA until recently ,COMMA you were the finance minister of Afghanistan ,COMMA a country right at the middle of much of the world's agenda .PERIOD 
Is the country gonna make it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Will democracy flourish ?QUESTIONMARK What scares you most ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ashraf Ghani :COLON What scares me most is -DASH -DASH is you ,COMMA lack of your engagement .PERIOD 
You asked me .PERIOD You know I always give the unconventional answer .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD But seriously ,COMMA the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as ,COMMA at least ,COMMA a 10- to 20-year perspective .PERIOD 
Today the world of globalization is on speed .PERIOD 
Time has been compressed .PERIOD 
And space does not exist for most people .PERIOD 
But in my world -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA when I went back to Afghanistan after <NUM> years ,COMMA space had expanded .PERIOD 
I rode -DASH -DASH traveled -DASH -DASH travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took <NUM> .PERIOD 
So the first is when the scale is that ,COMMA we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -DASH -DASH it takes six years to deliver infrastructure .PERIOD 
In our world .PERIOD 
Any meaningful sort of thing .PERIOD 
But the modality of attention ,COMMA or what is happening today ,COMMA what's happening tomorrow .PERIOD 
Second is ,COMMA when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense ,COMMA brutal forms of exercise of power -DASH -DASH we had the Red Army for <NUM> continuous years ,COMMA <NUM> strong ,COMMA literally terrorizing .PERIOD 
The sky :COLON every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear .PERIOD 
We were bombed practically out of existence .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -DASH -DASH from all sides .PERIOD 
The United States ,COMMA Great Britain ,COMMA joined for instance ,COMMA Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism .PERIOD 
How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror .PERIOD 
How to turn a donkey ,COMMA a carthorse ,COMMA anything .PERIOD 
And the Russians ,COMMA equally .PERIOD 
But we have to understand that we've been incredibly lucky .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA I really can't believe how lucky I am here ,COMMA standing in front of you ,COMMA speaking .PERIOD 
When I joined as finance minister ,COMMA I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent .PERIOD 
Those were the risks .PERIOD They were worth it .PERIOD 
I think we can make it ,COMMA and the reason we can make it is because of the people .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA because ,COMMA I mean -DASH -DASH I give you one statistic .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the men in Afghanistan ,COMMA <NUM> percent of the women ,COMMA listen to at least three radio stations a day .PERIOD 
In terms of their discourse ,COMMA in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world ,COMMA I think that I would dare say ,COMMA they're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -DASH -DASH because the world matters to them .PERIOD 
And what is their predominant concern ?QUESTIONMARK 
Abandonment .PERIOD 
Afghans have become deeply internationalist .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA when I went back in December of <NUM> ,COMMA I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I'd lived as a nationalist .PERIOD 
And I told them -DASH -DASH my people ,COMMA with the Americans here -DASH -DASH separate .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA I have an advisory position with the U.N .PERIOD 
I went through <NUM> Afghan provinces very rapidly .PERIOD 
And everybody was telling me it was a different world .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA they engage .PERIOD 
They see engagement ,COMMA global engagement ,COMMA as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people .PERIOD 
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -DASH -DASH Clare Lockhart is here ,COMMA so I'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan .PERIOD 
And that woman said she didn't care whether she had food on her table .PERIOD 
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future ,COMMA where her children could really have a different life .PERIOD 
That gives me hope .PERIOD 
How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ?QUESTIONMARK 
Certainly .PERIOD Well ,COMMA the first is ,COMMA instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies ,COMMA they should give this hundred billion dollars to <NUM> of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs .PERIOD 
The key to the drug eradication is jobs .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA textile .PERIOD 
Trade is the key ,COMMA not aid .PERIOD 
The U.S .PERIOD and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff .PERIOD 
The textile industry is incredibly mobile .PERIOD 
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment ,COMMA we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector ,COMMA if there was zero tariffs -DASH -DASH would create the type of job .PERIOD 
And we need to understand ,COMMA it's the value chain .PERIOD 
Look ,COMMA the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit .PERIOD 
It is important ,COMMA but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want is global access .PERIOD 
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -DASH -DASH and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again .PERIOD 
What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA we have the best embroiderers in the world !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy ?QUESTIONMARK 
With the Put Out system ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I think economically ,COMMA the critical issue really is to now think through .PERIOD 
And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the aid system is broken .PERIOD 
The aid system does not have the knowledge ,COMMA the vision ,COMMA the ability .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA to be exact ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
They didn't want to give us the money .PERIOD 
And it still didn't work ?QUESTIONMARK 
No .PERIOD It's not that it didn't work .PERIOD 
It's that a dollar of private investment ,COMMA in my judgment ,COMMA is equal at least to <NUM> dollars of aid ,COMMA in terms of the dynamic that it generates .PERIOD 
Second is that one dollar of aid could be <NUM> cents ;SEMICOLON it could be <NUM> cents ;SEMICOLON or it could be four dollars .PERIOD 
It depends on what form it comes ,COMMA what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA the aid system ,COMMA at first ,COMMA was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries ,COMMA not to generate growth in the poor countries .PERIOD 
And this is ,COMMA again ,COMMA one of those assumptions -DASH -DASH the way car seats are an assumption that we've inherited in governments ,COMMA and doors .PERIOD 
You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries ,COMMA provide advice ,COMMA but they do .PERIOD 
There's an entire weight of history vis-a-vis aid that now needs to be reexamined .PERIOD 
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -DASH -DASH and I'm putting that proposition equally ;SEMICOLON you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts -DASH -DASH aid must end in each country in a definable period .PERIOD 
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy .PERIOD 
Unless that kind of compact is entered into ,COMMA you will not be able to sustain the consensus .PERIOD 
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it ,COMMA the problems and the opportunities that we face ,COMMA and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic .PERIOD 
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you've all seen Inconvenient Truth .PERIOD This is a little more inconvenient .PERIOD 
 :COLON Man :COLON .. .PERIOD extremely dangerous questions .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA with our present knowledge ,COMMA we have no idea what would happen .PERIOD 
Even now ,COMMA man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate through the waste products of his civilization .PERIOD 
Due to our release ,COMMA through factories and automobiles every year ,COMMA of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide -DASH -DASH which helps air absorb heat from the sun -DASH -DASH our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer .PERIOD 
This is bad ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if this happens ,COMMA an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley .PERIOD 
Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through <NUM> feet of tropical water .PERIOD 
For ,COMMA in weather ,COMMA we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters ,COMMA but with life itself .PERIOD 
Larry Brilliant :COLON Should we feel good ,COMMA or should we feel bad that <NUM> years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it depends ,COMMA really ,COMMA on what your goals are .PERIOD 
And I think ,COMMA as my goals ,COMMA I always go back to Gandhi's talisman .PERIOD 
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked ,COMMA How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one ?QUESTIONMARK he said ,COMMA Consider the face of the poorest ,COMMA most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon ,COMMA and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person .PERIOD 
And if it will be ,COMMA it's the right thing to do ,COMMA and if not ,COMMA rethink it .PERIOD 
For those of us in this room ,COMMA it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual ,COMMA it's the community ,COMMA it's the culture ,COMMA it's the world itself .PERIOD 
But there's also a wonderful case for optimism .PERIOD 
Let's review them both .PERIOD First of all ,COMMA the megatrends .PERIOD 
There's two degrees ,COMMA or three degrees of climate change baked into the system .PERIOD 
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable ,COMMA as will the increasing rise of population .PERIOD 
Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb ,COMMA and we will not see <NUM> billion people in this decade ,COMMA as he had forecast ,COMMA we eat as if we were <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
And we consume so much that again ,COMMA a rise of <NUM> billion to <NUM> billion in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable .PERIOD 
That's why they migrate to cities .PERIOD 
That's why in June of this year ,COMMA we passed ,COMMA as a species ,COMMA <NUM> percent of us living in cities ,COMMA and bustees ,COMMA and slums ,COMMA and shantytowns .PERIOD 
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did .PERIOD 
The green revolution never reached Africa .PERIOD 
And with desertification ,COMMA sandstorms ,COMMA the Gobi Desert ,COMMA the Ogaden ,COMMA we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption .PERIOD 
In Africa last year ,COMMA Africans ate <NUM> million wild animals ,COMMA and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat .PERIOD 
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted ,COMMA the genomic sequences of which we don't know .PERIOD 
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of ,COMMA but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne ,COMMA emerging communicable diseases .PERIOD 
Increasingly ,COMMA I would say explosive growth of technology .PERIOD 
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth .PERIOD But it has a dark side -DASH -DASH in bioweapons ,COMMA and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger ,COMMA hatred or feeling of marginalization .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA with increasing globalization -DASH -DASH for which there are big winners and even bigger losers -DASH -DASH today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history .PERIOD 
One percent of us own <NUM> percent of all the goods and services .PERIOD 
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
The one percent will own even more than <NUM> percent of all the world's goods and services .PERIOD Not because they've grown richer ,COMMA but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer .PERIOD 
Last week ,COMMA Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said ,COMMA This situation is unprecedented ,COMMA unequal ,COMMA unfair and unstable .PERIOD 
So there's lots of reason for pessimism .PERIOD 
Darfur is ,COMMA at its origin ,COMMA a resource war .PERIOD 
Last year ,COMMA there were <NUM> riots in China ,COMMA <NUM> a day ,COMMA that required police or military intervention .PERIOD 
Most of them were about resources .PERIOD 
We are facing an unprecedented number ,COMMA scale of disasters .PERIOD 
Some are weather-related ,COMMA human-rights related ,COMMA epidemics .PERIOD 
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come .PERIOD It's a destabilized world .PERIOD 
And unlike destabilized world in the past ,COMMA it will be broadcast to you on YouTube ,COMMA you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones .PERIOD 
What will that lead to ?QUESTIONMARK 
For others ,COMMA withdrawal ,COMMA nihilism ,COMMA materialism .PERIOD 
For us ,COMMA where does it take us ,COMMA as social activists and entrepreneurs ?QUESTIONMARK 
As we look at these trends ,COMMA do we become despondent ,COMMA or will we become energized ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's look at one case ,COMMA the case of Bangladesh .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today ,COMMA global warming would continue .PERIOD 
And even with global warming -DASH -DASH if you can see these blue lines ,COMMA the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today ,COMMA the next decades will see rising sea levels .PERIOD 
What will that do to Bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK Let's take a look .PERIOD 
So here's Bangladesh .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level .PERIOD 
Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas .PERIOD 
And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt .PERIOD More water comes down ,COMMA the deforested areas ,COMMA here in the Tarai ,COMMA will be unable to absorb the effluent ,COMMA because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water .PERIOD 
Now we're looking down south ,COMMA through the Kali Gandaki .PERIOD 
Many of you ,COMMA I think ,COMMA have probably trekked here .PERIOD 
And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north ,COMMA and in the seas rising from the south .PERIOD 
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh .PERIOD 
And now let's look from the south ,COMMA looking up ,COMMA and let's see this in relief .PERIOD 
A minimum of <NUM> to <NUM> inches of increase in seas ,COMMA coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas .PERIOD And take a look at this .PERIOD 
As many as <NUM> million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China .PERIOD 
This is the difficulty that one country faces .PERIOD 
But if you look at the globe ,COMMA all around the earth ,COMMA wherever there is low-lying area ,COMMA populated areas near the water ,COMMA you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life .PERIOD 
Sub-Saharan Africa ,COMMA and even our own San Francisco Bay Area .PERIOD 
We're all in this together .PERIOD 
This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know .PERIOD 
Global warming is something that happens to all of us ,COMMA all at once .PERIOD 
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases ,COMMA names that you hadn't heard <NUM> years ago :COLON ebola ,COMMA lhasa fever ,COMMA monkey pox .PERIOD 
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans ,COMMA we live in each other's viral environment .PERIOD 
Do you remember ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA no one had ever heard of West Nile fever ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then we watched ,COMMA as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year ,COMMA westwardly .PERIOD 
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's just the beginning ,COMMA unfortunately .PERIOD 
There have been <NUM> novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
It's more than enough reason for pessimism .PERIOD 
But now let's look at the case for optimism .PERIOD 
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves .PERIOD 
We've been here before ,COMMA paralyzed by fear ,COMMA paralyzed into inaction ,COMMA when some -DASH -DASH probably one of you in this room -DASH -DASH jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility ,COMMA which fought against the nuclear threat ,COMMA Medicins Sans Frontieres ,COMMA that renewed our commitment to disaster relief ,COMMA Mohamed ElBaradei ,COMMA and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us ,COMMA and our own Muhammad Yunus .PERIOD 
We've seen the eradication of smallpox .PERIOD 
We may see the eradication of polio this year .PERIOD 
Last year ,COMMA there were only <NUM> cases in the world .PERIOD 
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -DASH -DASH there are only <NUM> cases left in the world .PERIOD 
And we've seen a new disease ,COMMA not like the <NUM> novel emerging communicable diseases .PERIOD 
It's an amazing phenomenon .PERIOD 
But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did .PERIOD 
They're not waiting until they die to create foundations .PERIOD 
They're actively guiding their money ,COMMA their resources ,COMMA their hearts ,COMMA their commitments ,COMMA to make the world a better place .PERIOD 
Certainly ,COMMA nothing can give you more optimism than that .PERIOD 
We all felt that we were part of it ,COMMA that a better world was right around the corner ,COMMA that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA there's another kind of movement .PERIOD It's a movement to save the earth .PERIOD 
It's just beginning .PERIOD 
Five weeks ago ,COMMA a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment .PERIOD 
Six months ago ,COMMA a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB <NUM> ,COMMA the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history .PERIOD 
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness .PERIOD 
Can you imagine ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed ,COMMA as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming .PERIOD 
And now <NUM> churches have joined the environmental movement .PERIOD 
It is something to be greatly optimistic about .PERIOD 
The European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough ,COMMA something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon .PERIOD 
And on April 14th ,COMMA there will be Step Up Day ,COMMA where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation -DASH -DASH pushing for legislation to stop global warming .PERIOD 
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air .PERIOD 
That means that people are beginning the first step ,COMMA which is acting out of their own self-interest .PERIOD 
But I am seeing in the major funders ,COMMA in CARE ,COMMA Rockefeller ,COMMA Rockefeller Brothers Fund ,COMMA Hewlett ,COMMA Mercy Corps ,COMMA you guys ,COMMA Google ,COMMA so many other organizations ,COMMA a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming ,COMMA but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable .PERIOD 
But for me ,COMMA I have another reason to be an incurable optimist .PERIOD 
And you've heard so many inspiring stories here ,COMMA and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine .PERIOD 
My background is not exactly conventional medical training .PERIOD 
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery ,COMMA and I studied with a very wise teacher ,COMMA who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny -DASH -DASH it felt like Yoda -DASH -DASH it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox ,COMMA at a time when there was no smallpox program .PERIOD 
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history .PERIOD 
In the last century -DASH -DASH that's the one that was seven years ago -DASH -DASH half a billion people died from smallpox :COLON more than all the wars in history ,COMMA more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world .PERIOD 
In the Summer of Love ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA two million people ,COMMA children ,COMMA died of smallpox .PERIOD 
It's not ancient history .PERIOD 
When you read the biblical plague of boils ,COMMA that was smallpox .PERIOD 
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth ,COMMA whose picture is here ,COMMA died of smallpox .PERIOD 
To eradicate smallpox ,COMMA we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history .PERIOD 
In a cruel reversal ,COMMA after we had almost conquered smallpox -DASH -DASH and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur ,COMMA the realm of the final inch .PERIOD 
When we had almost eradicated smallpox ,COMMA it came back again ,COMMA because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers ,COMMA who could come there and get employment .PERIOD 
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox ,COMMA and they went home to die .PERIOD 
And when they did ,COMMA they took smallpox to <NUM> other countries and reignited the epidemic .PERIOD 
And we had to start all over again .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA in the end ,COMMA we succeeded ,COMMA and the last case of smallpox :COLON this little girl ,COMMA Rahima Banu -DASH -DASH Barisal ,COMMA in Bangladesh -DASH -DASH when she coughed or breathed ,COMMA and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus ,COMMA thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror .PERIOD 
How can that not make you optimistic ?QUESTIONMARK 
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India ,COMMA and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India ,COMMA ended .PERIOD 
And most importantly for us here in this room ,COMMA a bond was created .PERIOD 
Doctors ,COMMA health workers ,COMMA from <NUM> different countries ,COMMA of every race ,COMMA every religion ,COMMA every color ,COMMA worked together ,COMMA fought alongside each other ,COMMA fought against a common enemy ,COMMA didn't fight against each other .PERIOD 
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ?QUESTIONMARK 
Today I want to talk about design ,COMMA but not design as we usually think about it .PERIOD 
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific ,COMMA biotechnological culture ,COMMA where ,COMMA for really the first time in history ,COMMA we have the power to design bodies ,COMMA to design animal bodies ,COMMA to design human bodies .PERIOD 
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as you all know ,COMMA species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments ,COMMA and the pressures of those environments selected which changes ,COMMA through random mutation in species ,COMMA were going to be preserved .PERIOD 
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution ,COMMA which was we changed the environment in which we evolved .PERIOD 
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .PERIOD 
And that has been the second great -DASH -DASH couple <NUM> years ,COMMA <NUM> years -DASH -DASH flow of our evolution .PERIOD 
By changing our environment ,COMMA we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve .PERIOD 
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities ,COMMA all the way through modern medicine ,COMMA we have changed our own evolution .PERIOD 
Now we're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history ,COMMA which has been called many things :COLON intentional evolution ,COMMA evolution by design -DASH -DASH very different than intelligent design -DASH -DASH whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet .PERIOD 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species ,COMMA as well as our cultures ,COMMA because of this change .PERIOD 
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .PERIOD 
We started selectively breeding animals many ,COMMA many thousands of years ago .PERIOD 
And if you think of dogs for example ,COMMA dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures .PERIOD 
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature .PERIOD 
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .PERIOD 
We don't have to do it that way anymore .PERIOD 
This is a beefalo .PERIOD 
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .PERIOD 
And they are now making them ,COMMA and someday ,COMMA perhaps pretty soon ,COMMA you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket .PERIOD 
This is a geep ,COMMA a goat-sheep hybrid .PERIOD 
I think they said it tasted like chicken .PERIOD 
This is a cama .PERIOD 
And they are now using these in certain cultures .PERIOD 
Then there's the liger .PERIOD 
This is the largest cat in the world -DASH -DASH the lion-tiger hybrid .PERIOD 
It's bigger than a tiger .PERIOD 
And in the case of the liger ,COMMA there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild .PERIOD 
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .PERIOD 
And then finally ,COMMA everybody's favorite ,COMMA the zorse .PERIOD 
None of this is Photoshopped .PERIOD These are real creatures .PERIOD 
And so one of the things we've been doing is using genetic enhancement ,COMMA or genetic manipulation ,COMMA of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics .PERIOD 
And if that were all this was about ,COMMA then it would be an interesting thing .PERIOD 
But something much ,COMMA much more powerful is happening now .PERIOD 
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish .PERIOD 
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA they've now taken that gene ,COMMA that bioluminescent gene ,COMMA and put it into mammal cells .PERIOD 
These are normal cells .PERIOD 
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light .PERIOD 
Once they could do that with cells ,COMMA they could do it with organisms .PERIOD 
So they did it with mouse pups ,COMMA kittens .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral ,COMMA while this is from jellyfish .PERIOD 
They did it with pigs .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA they did it with monkeys .PERIOD 
And if you can do it with monkeys -DASH -DASH though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -DASH -DASH if they can do it in monkeys ,COMMA they can probably figure out how to do it in apes ,COMMA which means they can do it in human beings .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark .PERIOD 
Be easier to find us at night .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA right now in many states ,COMMA you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets .PERIOD 
These are zebra fish .PERIOD They're normally black and silver .PERIOD 
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow ,COMMA green ,COMMA red ,COMMA and they are actually available now in certain states .PERIOD 
Other states have banned them .PERIOD 
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .PERIOD 
There is no area of the government -DASH -DASH not the EPA or the FDA -DASH -DASH that controls genetically-engineered pets .PERIOD 
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon .PERIOD 
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon ,COMMA using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat ,COMMA to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed .PERIOD 
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether ,COMMA pretty soon ,COMMA you could be eating this fish -DASH -DASH it'll be sold in the stores .PERIOD 
So even as we worry about it ,COMMA we have allowed it to go on in this country -DASH -DASH much different in Europe -DASH -DASH without any regulation ,COMMA and even without any identification on the package .PERIOD 
These are all the first cloned animals of their type .PERIOD 
So in the lower right here ,COMMA you have Dolly ,COMMA the first cloned sheep -DASH -DASH now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh ;SEMICOLON Ralph the rat ,COMMA the first cloned rat ;SEMICOLON CC the cat ,COMMA for cloned cat ;SEMICOLON Snuppy ,COMMA the first cloned dog -DASH -DASH Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -DASH -DASH created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo ,COMMA which he had not .PERIOD 
He actually was the first person to clone a dog ,COMMA which is a very difficult thing to do ,COMMA because dog genomes are very plastic .PERIOD 
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy ,COMMA a real gold ring of cloning ,COMMA because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed .PERIOD 
But if you can clone that horse ,COMMA you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud .PERIOD 
In addition ,COMMA we've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species .PERIOD 
So with antithrombin in that goat -DASH -DASH that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create .PERIOD 
And then in addition ,COMMA transgenic pigs ,COMMA knockout pigs ,COMMA from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea ,COMMA are pigs that they are going to use ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them ,COMMA instead of producing them in an industrial way .PERIOD 
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate .PERIOD 
A somatic cell ,COMMA a body cell ,COMMA was taken from its body ,COMMA gestated in the ovum of a cow ,COMMA and then that cow gave birth to a guar .PERIOD 
Same thing happened with the mouflon ,COMMA where it's an endangered species of sheep .PERIOD 
It was gestated in a regular sheep body ,COMMA which actually raises an interesting biological problem .PERIOD 
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .PERIOD 
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA ,COMMA but we also have DNA in our mitochondria ,COMMA which are the energy packets of the cell .PERIOD 
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .PERIOD 
So really ,COMMA what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon ,COMMA but a guar with cow mitochondria ,COMMA and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA ,COMMA and a mouflon with another species of sheep's mitochondrial DNA .PERIOD 
These are really hybrids ,COMMA not pure animals .PERIOD 
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -DASH -DASH a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve .PERIOD 
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach .PERIOD 
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top ,COMMA and it's on a big computer tracking ball .PERIOD 
They've created a kind of insect bot ,COMMA or bugbot .PERIOD 
It gets worse than that -DASH -DASH or perhaps better than that .PERIOD 
This actually is one of DARPA's very important -DASH -DASH DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -DASH -DASH one of their projects .PERIOD 
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings .PERIOD 
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs ,COMMA and they can fly these creatures around the lab .PERIOD 
They can make them go left ,COMMA right .PERIOD They can make them take off .PERIOD 
They can't actually make them land .PERIOD 
They put them about one inch above the ground ,COMMA and then they shut everything off and they go pfft .PERIOD 
But it's the closest they can get to a landing .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -DASH -DASH this is a moth -DASH -DASH this is the moth in its pupa stage ,COMMA and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology ,COMMA so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth ,COMMA it is already prewired .PERIOD 
The wires are already in its body ,COMMA and they can just hook it up to their technology ,COMMA and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance .PERIOD 
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones .PERIOD 
It's not just insects .PERIOD 
This is the ratbot ,COMMA or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA it's got technology -DASH -DASH it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres ;SEMICOLON it's got a camera on top of its head .PERIOD 
The scientists can make this creature go left ,COMMA right .PERIOD 
They have it running through mazes ,COMMA controlling where it's going .PERIOD 
They've now created an organic robot .PERIOD 
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar's lab said ,COMMA Is this ethical ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'll get back to that in a minute .PERIOD 
There's also been work done with monkeys .PERIOD 
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .PERIOD 
He took owl monkeys ,COMMA wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved ,COMMA especially looking at the movement of their right arm .PERIOD 
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .PERIOD 
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm ,COMMA which you see here in the picture ,COMMA put the arm in another room .PERIOD 
Pretty soon ,COMMA the computer learned ,COMMA by reading the monkey's brainwaves ,COMMA to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey's arm did .PERIOD 
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm ,COMMA and the monkey got fascinated .PERIOD 
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm ,COMMA this prosthetic arm would do .PERIOD 
And eventually she was moving it and moving it ,COMMA and eventually stopped moving her right arm and ,COMMA staring at the screen ,COMMA could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -DASH -DASH which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms .PERIOD 
And it's not just technology that we're putting into animals .PERIOD 
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .PERIOD 
He took <NUM> and then <NUM> disaggregated rat neurons -DASH -DASH so these are just individual neurons from rats -DASH -DASH put them on a chip .PERIOD 
They self-aggregated into a network ,COMMA became an integrated chip .PERIOD 
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living ,COMMA self-aggregating neurons .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact ,COMMA independent lamprey eel brain .PERIOD 
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .PERIOD 
It is living -DASH -DASH fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides ,COMMA attached photosensitive sensors to the brain ,COMMA put it into a cart -DASH -DASH here's the cart ,COMMA the brain is sitting there in the middle -DASH -DASH and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart ,COMMA when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart ,COMMA the cart moves toward the light ;SEMICOLON when you turn it off ,COMMA it moves away .PERIOD 
It's photophilic .PERIOD 
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .PERIOD 
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts ,COMMA sitting there in its nutrient medium ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes .PERIOD 
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin ,COMMA put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being .PERIOD 
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .PERIOD 
This is where we are in this process .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA not that long ago ,COMMA Craig Venter created the first artificial cell ,COMMA where he took a cell ,COMMA took a DNA synthesizer ,COMMA which is a machine ,COMMA created an artificial genome ,COMMA put it in a different cell -DASH -DASH the genome was not of the cell he put it in -DASH -DASH and that cell then reproduced as the other cell .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -DASH -DASH it did not have an organic parent .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA asks The Economist :COLON The first artificial organism and its consequences .PERIOD 
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like .PERIOD 
This is a DNA synthesizer ,COMMA and here at the bottom are just bottles of A ,COMMA T ,COMMA C and G -DASH -DASH the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA we need to ask ourselves some questions .PERIOD 
For the first time in the history of this planet ,COMMA we are able to directly design organisms .PERIOD 
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power ,COMMA and it confers on us a responsibility .PERIOD 
Is everything okay ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do we have free reign to design animals ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I want a dog .PERIOD 
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund ,COMMA the body of a retriever ,COMMA maybe some pink fur ,COMMA and let's make it glow in the dark ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does industry get to create creatures who ,COMMA in their milk ,COMMA in their blood ,COMMA and in their saliva and other bodily fluids ,COMMA create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do we get to create organic robots ,COMMA where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then the final step of this ,COMMA once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings ,COMMA what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's already happening .PERIOD It's not science fiction .PERIOD 
We are now taking control of our own evolution .PERIOD 
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .PERIOD 
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now .PERIOD 
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
Interestingly ,COMMA Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man ,COMMA in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world .PERIOD 
Over the course of his life ,COMMA Darwin had great privilege .PERIOD 
He lived in a fairly wealthy home .PERIOD 
And when he was in his 20s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship the Beagle .PERIOD 
And during the course of that voyage ,COMMA he saw remarkable things :COLON tremendous diversity of plants and animals ,COMMA and humans .PERIOD 
Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history .PERIOD 
It wasn't until much longer ,COMMA much later ,COMMA that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans .PERIOD 
Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle ,COMMA and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists ,COMMA he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied .PERIOD 
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color .PERIOD 
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator ;SEMICOLON lightly pigmented peoples ,COMMA like himself ,COMMA were found closer to the poles .PERIOD 
So what did he make of all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species .PERIOD 
But much later ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA he did have something to say about it .PERIOD 
And it was quite curious .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Of all the differences between the races of men ,COMMA the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked .PERIOD 
And he went on to say ,COMMA These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate .PERIOD 
So he had traveled all around .PERIOD 
He had seen people of different colors living in different places .PERIOD 
And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate .PERIOD 
If only Darwin lived today .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment .PERIOD 
And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface .PERIOD 
The TOMS <NUM> satellite data ,COMMA shown here ,COMMA show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface .PERIOD 
Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year .PERIOD 
The incrementally cooler colors -DASH -DASH blues ,COMMA greens ,COMMA yellows ,COMMA and finally grays -DASH -DASH indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation .PERIOD 
What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones .PERIOD 
And what Darwin could not appreciate ,COMMA or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time ,COMMA is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation .PERIOD 
And so when we look at a map of skin color ,COMMA and predicted skin color ,COMMA as we know it today ,COMMA what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator ,COMMA and the lightest ones toward the poles .PERIOD 
What's very ,COMMA very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high-UV environments ,COMMA in equatorial Africa .PERIOD 
The earliest members of our lineage ,COMMA the genus Homo ,COMMA were darkly pigmented .PERIOD 
And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented ,COMMA two million to one and half million years ago .PERIOD 
Now what happened in our history ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface .PERIOD 
In those early days of our evolution ,COMMA looking at the equator ,COMMA we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation .PERIOD 
The UVC ,COMMA the most energetic type ,COMMA was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere .PERIOD 
But UVB and UVA especially ,COMMA came in unimpeded .PERIOD 
UVB turns out to be incredibly important .PERIOD 
It's very destructive ,COMMA but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin ,COMMA vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones ,COMMA the health of our immune system ,COMMA and myriad other important functions in our bodies .PERIOD 
This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms .PERIOD 
Melanin ,COMMA in various forms ,COMMA has probably been on the Earth a billion years ,COMMA and has been recruited over and over again by evolution ,COMMA as often happens .PERIOD 
Why change it if it works ?QUESTIONMARK 
So melanin was recruited ,COMMA in our lineage ,COMMA and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa ,COMMA to be a natural sunscreen .PERIOD 
Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation ,COMMA the destruction ,COMMA or damage to DNA ,COMMA and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate ,COMMA which helps to fuel cell production ,COMMA and reproduction in the body .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's wonderful .PERIOD We evolved this very protective ,COMMA wonderful covering of melanin .PERIOD 
But then we moved .PERIOD 
And humans dispersed -DASH -DASH not once ,COMMA but twice .PERIOD 
When humans dispersed into these latitudes ,COMMA what did they face ?QUESTIONMARK 
Conditions were significantly colder ,COMMA but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime .PERIOD 
So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere ,COMMA look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation .PERIOD 
We're still getting a dose of UVA .PERIOD 
But all of the UVB ,COMMA or nearly all of it ,COMMA is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere .PERIOD 
In the winter ,COMMA when you are skiing in the Alps ,COMMA you may experience ultraviolet radiation .PERIOD 
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year .PERIOD 
This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation .PERIOD 
Because what happened ,COMMA in order to ensure health and well-being ,COMMA these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation .PERIOD 
There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin .PERIOD 
Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity .PERIOD 
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once ,COMMA not just twice ,COMMA but probably three times .PERIOD 
Not just in modern humans ,COMMA but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors ,COMMA the Neanderthals .PERIOD 
A remarkable ,COMMA remarkable testament to the power of evolution .PERIOD 
And just in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA in increasing rates ,COMMA over increasing distances .PERIOD 
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions :COLON people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa .PERIOD 
Between <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> million ,COMMA <NUM> people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade .PERIOD 
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences .PERIOD 
But it also had deleterious health consequences to people .PERIOD 
So what ?QUESTIONMARK We've been on the move .PERIOD 
We're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted .PERIOD 
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high-UV areas .PERIOD 
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low-UV areas .PERIOD 
These have tremendous consequences for our health .PERIOD 
We have to ,COMMA if we're lightly pigmented ,COMMA be careful about the problems of skin cancer ,COMMA and destruction of folate in our bodies ,COMMA by lots of sun .PERIOD 
Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin .PERIOD 
What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas ,COMMA or working inside all the time .PERIOD 
Because the problem there is just as severe ,COMMA but it is more sinister ,COMMA because vitamin D deficiency ,COMMA from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation ,COMMA is a major problem .PERIOD 
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people ,COMMA and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones ,COMMA to their gradual decay of their immune systems ,COMMA or loss of immune function ,COMMA and probably some problems with their mood and health ,COMMA their mental health .PERIOD 
So we have ,COMMA in skin pigmentation ,COMMA one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .PERIOD 
And the social consequences ,COMMA as we know ,COMMA are incredibly profound .PERIOD 
We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another ,COMMA but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions .PERIOD 
So how can we overcome this ?QUESTIONMARK 
How can we begin to understand it ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> years after Darwin's birthday ,COMMA we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States .PERIOD 
How wonderful is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons .PERIOD 
He ,COMMA as one of many urban admixed populations ,COMMA is very emblematic of a mixed parentage ,COMMA of a mixed pigmentation .PERIOD 
And he resembles ,COMMA very closely ,COMMA people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa ,COMMA or Southeast Asia .PERIOD 
These people have a tremendous potential to tan ,COMMA to develop more pigment in their skin ,COMMA as a result of exposure to sun .PERIOD 
So lets all wish for his great health ,COMMA and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation .PERIOD 
Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation ,COMMA and the phenomenon of pigmentation ,COMMA is that it is the demonstration ,COMMA the evidence ,COMMA of evolution by natural selection ,COMMA right on your body .PERIOD 
When people ask you ,COMMA What is the evidence for evolution ?QUESTIONMARK 
You don't have to think about some exotic examples ,COMMA or fossils .PERIOD 
You just have to look at your skin .PERIOD 
I think ,COMMA were he able to look at the evidence we have today ,COMMA he would understand it .PERIOD 
He would appreciate it .PERIOD 
And most of all ,COMMA he would teach it .PERIOD 
You ,COMMA you can teach it .PERIOD 
You can touch it .PERIOD 
You can understand it .PERIOD 
Take it out of this room .PERIOD 
Take your skin color ,COMMA and celebrate it .PERIOD 
Spread the word .PERIOD 
You have the evolution of the history of our species ,COMMA part of it ,COMMA written in your skin .PERIOD 
Understand it .PERIOD Appreciate it .PERIOD Celebrate it .PERIOD 
Go out .PERIOD Isn't it beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK Isn't it wonderful ?QUESTIONMARK 
You are the products of evolution .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Please excuse me for sitting ;SEMICOLON I'm very old .PERIOD 
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever ,COMMA and ancient authors have written about it .PERIOD 
It was very much uncontrollable ,COMMA and in a certain sense ,COMMA it seemed to be the extreme of complexity ,COMMA just a mess ,COMMA a mess and a mess .PERIOD 
There are many different kinds of mess .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA by a complete fluke ,COMMA I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity ,COMMA and to my utter amazement ,COMMA I found traces -DASH -DASH very strong traces ,COMMA I must say -DASH -DASH of order in that roughness .PERIOD 
And so today ,COMMA I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents .PERIOD 
I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity -DASH -DASH to someone who had Latin in my long-past youth -DASH -DASH means the contrary of regularity .PERIOD 
But it is not so .PERIOD 
Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough .PERIOD 
So let me show you a few objects .PERIOD 
Some of them are artificial .PERIOD 
Others of them are very real ,COMMA in a certain sense .PERIOD 
Now this is the real .PERIOD It's a cauliflower .PERIOD 
Because old and ancient as it may be ,COMMA it's very complicated and it's very simple ,COMMA both at the same time .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's very interesting .PERIOD 
And then you cut again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA and you still get small cauliflowers .PERIOD 
So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property ,COMMA that each part is like the whole ,COMMA but smaller .PERIOD 
Very ,COMMA very little .PERIOD 
So what I did actually is to study this problem ,COMMA and I found something quite surprising .PERIOD 
That one can measure roughness by a number ,COMMA a number ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> and sometimes much more .PERIOD 
One day ,COMMA a friend of mine ,COMMA to bug me ,COMMA brought a picture and said ,COMMA What is the roughness of this curve ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA just short of <NUM> .PERIOD 
It was <NUM> .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it didn't take me any time .PERIOD 
I've been looking at these things for so long .PERIOD 
So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces .PERIOD 
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial .PERIOD 
They were done on a computer ,COMMA and the only input is a number ,COMMA and that number is roughness .PERIOD 
So on the left ,COMMA I took the roughness copied from many landscapes .PERIOD 
To the right ,COMMA I took a higher roughness .PERIOD 
So the eye ,COMMA after a while ,COMMA can distinguish these two very well .PERIOD 
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness .PERIOD 
This is very rough ,COMMA and this is sort of smooth ,COMMA and this perfectly smooth .PERIOD 
Very few things are very smooth .PERIOD 
So then if you try to ask questions :COLON What's the surface of a cauliflower ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA you measure and measure and measure .PERIOD 
Each time you're closer ,COMMA it gets bigger ,COMMA down to very ,COMMA very small distances .PERIOD 
What's the length of the coastline of these lakes ?QUESTIONMARK 
The closer you measure ,COMMA the longer it is .PERIOD 
The concept of length of coastline ,COMMA which seems to be so natural because it's given in many cases ,COMMA is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA complete fallacy ;SEMICOLON there's no such thing .PERIOD 
You must do it differently .PERIOD 
What good is that ,COMMA to know these things ?QUESTIONMARK 
To begin with ,COMMA artificial landscapes ,COMMA which I invented sort of ,COMMA are used in cinema all the time .PERIOD 
We see mountains in the distance .PERIOD 
They may be mountains ,COMMA but they may be just formulae ,COMMA just cranked on .PERIOD 
Now it's very easy to do .PERIOD 
Now look at that .PERIOD That's a real lung .PERIOD 
Now a lung is something very strange .PERIOD 
If you take this thing ,COMMA you know very well it weighs very little .PERIOD 
The volume of a lung is very small ,COMMA but what about the area of the lung ?QUESTIONMARK 
Some say that a normal male's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [court] .PERIOD 
And the others say ,COMMA no ,COMMA five basketball [courts] .PERIOD 
Enormous disagreements .PERIOD 
Why so ?QUESTIONMARK Because ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the area of the lung is something very ill-defined .PERIOD 
The bronchi branch ,COMMA branch ,COMMA branch and they stop branching ,COMMA not because of any matter of principle ,COMMA but because of physical considerations :COLON the mucus ,COMMA which is in the lung .PERIOD 
So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung ,COMMA but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale ,COMMA for a man and for a little rodent .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what good is it to have that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA amazingly enough ,COMMA the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently .PERIOD 
And I think that my mathematics ,COMMA surprisingly enough ,COMMA has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses ,COMMA all these branching systems ,COMMA for which there was no geometry .PERIOD 
So I found myself ,COMMA in other words ,COMMA constructing a geometry ,COMMA a geometry of things which had no geometry .PERIOD 
And a surprising aspect of it is that very often ,COMMA the rules of this geometry are extremely short .PERIOD 
You have formulas that long .PERIOD 
And you crank it several times .PERIOD 
Sometimes repeatedly :COLON again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA the same repetition .PERIOD 
And at the end ,COMMA you get things like that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Something so complicated like a cloud ,COMMA so unstable ,COMMA so varying ,COMMA should have a simple rule behind it .PERIOD 
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds .PERIOD 
The seer of clouds had to take account of it .PERIOD 
I don't know how much advanced these pictures are .PERIOD They're old .PERIOD 
I was very much involved in it ,COMMA but then turned my attention to other phenomena .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA here is another thing which is rather interesting .PERIOD 
One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics ,COMMA which is not appreciated by many people ,COMMA occurred about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist .PERIOD 
A curve's a curve ,COMMA a plane's a plane ,COMMA and the two won't mix .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA they do mix .PERIOD 
A man named Peano did define such curves ,COMMA and it became an object of extraordinary interest .PERIOD 
It was very important ,COMMA but mostly interesting because a kind of break ,COMMA a separation between the mathematics coming from reality ,COMMA on the one hand ,COMMA and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA seen at long last what had been seen for a long time .PERIOD 
And so here I introduce something ,COMMA the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve .PERIOD 
And well ,COMMA it's a story unto itself .PERIOD 
So it was in <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .PERIOD 
And the objects which were used as examples ,COMMA when I was a child and a student ,COMMA as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -DASH -DASH those objects ,COMMA I turned them completely around .PERIOD 
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA a man named Hausdorff in <NUM> introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke ,COMMA and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness .PERIOD 
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said ,COMMA Don't be silly .PERIOD It's just something [silly] .PERIOD 
Well actually ,COMMA I was not silly .PERIOD 
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well .PERIOD 
The things on the ground are algae .PERIOD 
He did not know the mathematics ;SEMICOLON it didn't yet exist .PERIOD 
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West .PERIOD 
But painting for a long time had a fractal side .PERIOD 
I could speak of that for a long time .PERIOD 
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect .PERIOD 
This is a mess ,COMMA mess ,COMMA mess ,COMMA Brownian loop .PERIOD 
One day I decided -DASH -DASH halfway through my career ,COMMA I was held by so many things in my work -DASH -DASH I decided to test myself .PERIOD 
Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA so I looked at these things called Brownian motion -DASH -DASH just goes around .PERIOD 
I played with it for a while ,COMMA and I made it return to the origin .PERIOD 
So he painted it ,COMMA which means he put inside everything .PERIOD He said :COLON Well ,COMMA this thing came out .. .PERIOD And I said ,COMMA Stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK Stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK Stop !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I see ;SEMICOLON it's an island .PERIOD 
And amazing .PERIOD 
So Brownian motion ,COMMA which happens to have a roughness number of two ,COMMA goes around .PERIOD 
I measured it ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
Long measurements ,COMMA big Brownian motions ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Mathematical problem :COLON how to prove it ?QUESTIONMARK 
It took my friends <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Three of them were having incomplete proofs .PERIOD 
They got together ,COMMA and together they had the proof .PERIOD 
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics ,COMMA one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them .PERIOD 
Now everybody asks me at one point or another ,COMMA How did it all start ?QUESTIONMARK 
What got you in that strange business ?QUESTIONMARK 
What got you to be ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA a mechanical engineer ,COMMA a geographer and a mathematician and so on ,COMMA a physicist ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well actually I started ,COMMA oddly enough ,COMMA studying stock market prices .PERIOD 
And so here I had this theory ,COMMA and I wrote books about it -DASH -DASH financial prices increments .PERIOD 
To the left you see data over a long period .PERIOD 
To the right ,COMMA on top ,COMMA you see a theory which is very ,COMMA very fashionable .PERIOD 
There are thousands of books on that .PERIOD 
Now compare that with real price increments .PERIOD 
Where are real price increments ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did .PERIOD 
So the idea there was that one must be able to -DASH -DASH how do you say ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH model price variation .PERIOD 
And it went really well <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
For <NUM> years ,COMMA people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much ,COMMA much easier .PERIOD 
But I tell you ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA people listened to me .PERIOD 
These two curves are averages :COLON Standard &amp ;SEMICOLON Poor ,COMMA the blue one ;SEMICOLON and the red one is Standard &amp ;SEMICOLON Poor's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out .PERIOD 
Now discontinuities are a nuisance ,COMMA so in many studies of prices ,COMMA one puts them aside .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA acts of God .PERIOD 
And you have the little nonsense which is left .PERIOD 
Acts of God .PERIOD In this picture ,COMMA five acts of God are as important as everything else .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA it is not acts of God that we should put aside .PERIOD 
That is the meat ,COMMA the problem .PERIOD 
If you master these ,COMMA you master price ,COMMA and if you don't master these ,COMMA you can master the little noise as well as you can ,COMMA but it's not important .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA here are the curves for it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I get to the final thing ,COMMA which is the set of which my name is attached .PERIOD 
My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France .PERIOD 
Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week ,COMMA I had very big dreams .PERIOD 
And after the war ,COMMA I saw an uncle again .PERIOD 
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician ,COMMA and he told me ,COMMA Look ,COMMA there's a problem which I could not solve <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and which nobody can solve .PERIOD 
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia and [Pierre] Fatou .PERIOD 
Very simple .PERIOD 
So I looked ,COMMA and like the thousands of people that had tried before ,COMMA I found nothing .PERIOD 
But then the computer came ,COMMA and I decided to apply the computer ,COMMA not to new problems in mathematics -DASH -DASH like this wiggle wiggle ,COMMA that's a new problem -DASH -DASH but to old problems .PERIOD 
And I went from what's called real numbers ,COMMA which are points on a line ,COMMA to imaginary ,COMMA complex numbers ,COMMA which are points on a plane ,COMMA which is what one should do there ,COMMA and this shape came out .PERIOD 
This shape is of an extraordinary complication .PERIOD 
The equation is hidden there ,COMMA z goes into z squared ,COMMA plus c .PERIOD 
It's so simple ,COMMA so dry .PERIOD 
It's so uninteresting .PERIOD 
Now you turn the crank once ,COMMA twice :COLON twice ,COMMA marvels come out .PERIOD 
I mean this comes out .PERIOD 
I don't want to explain these things .PERIOD 
This comes out .PERIOD This comes out .PERIOD 
Shapes which are of such complication ,COMMA such harmony and such beauty .PERIOD 
This comes out repeatedly ,COMMA again ,COMMA again ,COMMA again .PERIOD 
And that was one of my major discoveries ,COMMA to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing ,COMMA more or less .PERIOD 
And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place .PERIOD 
All that from this little formula ,COMMA which has whatever ,COMMA five symbols in it .PERIOD 
And then this one .PERIOD 
The color was added for two reasons .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA because these shapes are so complicated that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers .PERIOD 
And if you plot them ,COMMA you must choose some system .PERIOD 
And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that ,COMMA and others it is that or that .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA I was in Cambridge ,COMMA U.K .PERIOD 
to receive a prize from the university ,COMMA and three days later ,COMMA a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing .PERIOD 
So where did this come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day <NUM> letters from people saying ,COMMA But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA let me finish .PERIOD 
This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics .PERIOD 
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules ,COMMA which are repeated without end .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains ,COMMA far from these beautiful mountains ,COMMA where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different ,COMMA which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product .PERIOD 
And why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
After all ,COMMA happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few ,COMMA but a fundamental human right for all .PERIOD 
And what is happiness ?QUESTIONMARK 
Happiness is the freedom of choice .PERIOD 
The freedom to chose where to live ,COMMA what to do ,COMMA what to buy ,COMMA what to sell ,COMMA from whom ,COMMA to whom ,COMMA when and how .PERIOD 
Where does choice come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
And who gets to express it ,COMMA and how do we express it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA one way to express choice is through the market .PERIOD 
Well-functioning markets provide choices ,COMMA and ultimately ,COMMA the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness .PERIOD 
The great Indian economist ,COMMA Amartya Sen ,COMMA was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply ,COMMA but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market .PERIOD 
That was a turning point for my life .PERIOD 
And most of Africa's farmers are ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA small farmers in terms of land that they operate ,COMMA and very ,COMMA very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal .PERIOD 
African agriculture today is among ,COMMA or is ,COMMA the most under-capitalized in the world .PERIOD 
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated ,COMMA compared to <NUM> percent in Asia .PERIOD 
African farmers only use some <NUM> kilograms of fertilizer per hectare ,COMMA compared to <NUM> in Asia .PERIOD 
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa .PERIOD 
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America ,COMMA and three times more tractors in Asia ,COMMA than in Africa .PERIOD 
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice ,COMMA and therefore without much freedom .PERIOD 
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty .PERIOD 
He comes to the market when prices are lowest ,COMMA with the meager fruits of his hard labor ,COMMA just after the harvest ,COMMA because he has no choice .PERIOD 
She comes back to the market some months later ,COMMA when prices are highest ,COMMA in what we call the lean season -DASH -DASH when food is scarce -DASH -DASH because she has to feed her family and has no choice .PERIOD 
The real question is ,COMMA how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists ?QUESTIONMARK 
Another notable economist ,COMMA Theodore Schultz ,COMMA in <NUM> won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient ,COMMA but poor .PERIOD 
Meaning ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we don't need ,COMMA now ,COMMA any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money ,COMMA just like everyone else .PERIOD 
And one thing is clear ,COMMA which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business .PERIOD 
And that business is agriculture .PERIOD 
Over two decades ago ,COMMA the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized ,COMMA that economies must be structurally adjusted .PERIOD 
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -DASH -DASH which they did rather inefficiently -DASH -DASH and let the private market do its magic .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA what happened over the last <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
Did Africa feed itself ?QUESTIONMARK 
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ?QUESTIONMARK 
I think we're all in this room ,COMMA probably ,COMMA because we know that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next <NUM> years ,COMMA where the food import bill is now double what it was <NUM> years ago ,COMMA where food production per capita has stagnated ,COMMA and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased .PERIOD 
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations ?QUESTIONMARK 
The market reforms prompted by the West -DASH -DASH and I've spent some <NUM> years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets ,COMMA and have interviewed traders in <NUM> to <NUM> countries in this continent ,COMMA hundreds of traders -DASH -DASH trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform .PERIOD 
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water .PERIOD 
Like its agriculture ,COMMA Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient .PERIOD 
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market ,COMMA and the risks of transacting in rural ,COMMA agriculture markets ,COMMA are extremely high .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market .PERIOD 
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications ,COMMA but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions ,COMMA such as market information ,COMMA grades and standards ,COMMA and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers .PERIOD 
Because of this ,COMMA commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles ,COMMA in narrow networks of people they know and trust .PERIOD 
And because of that ,COMMA as grain changes hands -DASH -DASH and I've measured that it changes hands four ,COMMA five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -DASH -DASH every time it changes hands -DASH -DASH and I've seen this all over rural Africa -DASH -DASH it also changes sacks .PERIOD 
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar .PERIOD 
And really realized that that was because -DASH -DASH as traders would tell me over and over -DASH -DASH that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality .PERIOD 
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals ,COMMA and situations where there are deficits ,COMMA for example .PERIOD 
I have measured that <NUM> percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that ,COMMA because of the absence of grades and standards and market information ,COMMA sacks have to be constantly changed .PERIOD 
And this leads to very high handling costs .PERIOD 
For their part ,COMMA small farmers ,COMMA who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa ,COMMA come to the market with virtually no information at all -DASH -DASH blind -DASH -DASH trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce ,COMMA and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market ,COMMA the nearest local market they know -DASH -DASH where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk .PERIOD 
In Africa ,COMMA small farmers bear the brunt of this risk .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA in my view ,COMMA there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear .PERIOD 
And in my view ,COMMA there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face .PERIOD 
In Ethiopia ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as <NUM> percent annually .PERIOD 
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling ,COMMA and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology ,COMMA such as modern seeds and fertilizers ,COMMA but also direct implications for food security .PERIOD 
To give you an example ,COMMA between <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest .PERIOD 
That in turn ,COMMA because of the weak marketing system ,COMMA led to an <NUM> percent collapse in maize prices in the country .PERIOD 
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields .PERIOD 
And we calculated that some <NUM> tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early <NUM> .PERIOD 
Not six months later ,COMMA in July <NUM> ,COMMA Ethiopia announced a major food crisis ,COMMA to the same proportions as <NUM> :COLON <NUM> million people at risk of starvation .PERIOD 
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains ,COMMA and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain ,COMMA farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market ,COMMA not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
This is a tragic example of arrested development ,COMMA or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks .PERIOD 
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia ,COMMA but happens over and over ,COMMA all over Africa .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I'm not here today to lament about the situation ,COMMA or wring my hands .PERIOD 
I am here to tell you that change is in the air .PERIOD 
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions ,COMMA or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions .PERIOD 
Africa has learned ,COMMA or is learning somewhat slowly ,COMMA that markets don't happen by themselves .PERIOD 
In the 1980s ,COMMA it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right .PERIOD 
There was a very influential book about that ,COMMA which was mainly about getting governments out of the market .PERIOD 
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives ,COMMA but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market .PERIOD 
When conditions are right ,COMMA we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa ,COMMA just like anywhere else .PERIOD 
Nearly three years ago ,COMMA I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth ,COMMA Ethiopia ,COMMA after nearly <NUM> years abroad .PERIOD 
I did so for a simple reason .PERIOD 
After having spent more than a decade understanding ,COMMA studying ,COMMA and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets ,COMMA I decided it was time to do something about it .PERIOD 
I currently lead ,COMMA in Ethiopia ,COMMA an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange ,COMMA or ECX .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the commodity exchange itself ,COMMA that concept ,COMMA is not new to the world .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves .PERIOD 
That was ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade ,COMMA which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world .PERIOD 
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange .PERIOD 
But once it arrived ,COMMA if no buyer was to be found ,COMMA or if prices suddenly dropped ,COMMA farmers would incur tremendous losses .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan ,COMMA rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market ,COMMA and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -DASH -DASH issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done .PERIOD 
From there ,COMMA the greatest innovation of all came about in this market ,COMMA which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain .PERIOD 
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances ,COMMA and even across time -DASH -DASH as far forward as <NUM> months into the future .PERIOD 
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture ,COMMA and the rise of Chicago to a global market ,COMMA agricultural market ,COMMA superpower from where it was ,COMMA a small regional town .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA over the last century ,COMMA we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries ,COMMA and that the reference prices for cotton ,COMMA coffee ,COMMA cocoa -DASH -DASH products produced mainly in the south -DASH -DASH are actually a reference price ,COMMA or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries .PERIOD 
But that is actually changing .PERIOD 
And we're seeing a shift -DASH -DASH powered mainly because of information technology -DASH -DASH a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets .PERIOD 
And over the last decade ,COMMA you see that the share of Western exchanges -DASH -DASH and this is the U.S .PERIOD share of exchanges in the world -DASH -DASH has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade .PERIOD 
Similarly ,COMMA there's been explosive growth in India ,COMMA for example ,COMMA where rural farmers are using exchanges -DASH -DASH growing here over the last three years by <NUM> percent a year .PERIOD 
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology ,COMMA aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .PERIOD 
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange ,COMMA three years ago ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in Ethiopia ,COMMA we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange .PERIOD 
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model ,COMMA but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities ,COMMA Ethiopia's small farmers .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia .PERIOD 
We're creating a system that serves all market actors ,COMMA that creates integrity ,COMMA trust ,COMMA efficiency ,COMMA transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described .PERIOD 
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia ,COMMA we've done something rather unique ,COMMA which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective ,COMMA or what we call the ECX Edge .PERIOD 
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself .PERIOD 
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work .PERIOD 
You've got one donor trying to develop market information ,COMMA another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards ,COMMA another ICT ,COMMA and yet another on warehousing ,COMMA or warehouse receipts .PERIOD 
In our approach in Ethiopia ,COMMA we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem ,COMMA or environment ,COMMA in which trade takes place .PERIOD 
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system ,COMMA which will initially start as an open outcry ,COMMA because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading .PERIOD 
But at the same time ,COMMA we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done ,COMMA which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas .PERIOD 
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -DASH -DASH what we call the remote access terminal centers -DASH -DASH and actually ,COMMA without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things ,COMMA simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor .PERIOD 
At the same time ,COMMA what's very fundamental to this market is that -DASH -DASH and again ,COMMA an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -DASH -DASH is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country ,COMMA in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done .PERIOD 
And in turn ,COMMA we'll operate an in-house clearing system ,COMMA to assure that payment is done appropriately ,COMMA in the right amount and at the right time ,COMMA so that basically ,COMMA we create trust and integrity in the system .PERIOD 
Obviously ,COMMA we work with exchange actors ,COMMA and as we're developing the exchange market itself ,COMMA we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework ,COMMA the overarching legal framework for making this market work .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA our proclamation is going to parliament next month .PERIOD 
What this does is transforms ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA the farmers' relationship to the market .PERIOD 
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -DASH -DASH meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market ,COMMA eight to <NUM> kilometers away on average ,COMMA and sell whatever they happened to have ,COMMA without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -DASH -DASH now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .PERIOD 
And they start to think national ,COMMA and even global .PERIOD 
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions ,COMMA but also planting decisions ,COMMA on the basis of information coming from the futures price market .PERIOD 
So all of this will transform farmers .PERIOD 
It will also transform the way traders do business .PERIOD 
It will stop them from doing simple ,COMMA back-to-back ,COMMA limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas] .PERIOD 
Can Ethiopia do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
It seems very ambitious .PERIOD 
But it will create new opportunities .PERIOD 
We believe that this initiative requires great political will ,COMMA and we'll have to align the financial sector ,COMMA as well as the ICT sector ,COMMA and really even the underlying legal framework .PERIOD 
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium ,COMMA which starts in about eight months .PERIOD 
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today .PERIOD 
ECX ,COMMA moreover ,COMMA can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities .PERIOD 
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .PERIOD 
And we feel that over the next five years ,COMMA if Ethiopia can capture even <NUM> percent ,COMMA just <NUM> percent ,COMMA of the domestic market ,COMMA and add just <NUM> percent value to that market ,COMMA the value of the market doubles .PERIOD 
So the potential is there .PERIOD 
The will is there .PERIOD 
The commitment is there .PERIOD 
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices ,COMMA to grow our agriculture ,COMMA and to change Africa .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we are in the business of finding our happiness .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
About the size of the Great Wall of China ,COMMA this would hardly be an invisible structure .PERIOD 
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible ,COMMA or near-invisible ,COMMA to the naked eye :COLON bacteria and grains of sand .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA as architects we're trained to solve problems .PERIOD 
But I don't really believe in architectural problems ;SEMICOLON I only believe in opportunities .PERIOD 
Which is why I'll show you a threat ,COMMA and an architectural response .PERIOD 
My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand ,COMMA stretching across the desert .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions .PERIOD 
It is simple and complex .PERIOD 
It is peaceful and violent .PERIOD 
That's a cyclical process .PERIOD 
As rocks and mountains die ,COMMA grains of sand are born .PERIOD 
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone .PERIOD 
And as the sandstone weathers ,COMMA new grains break free .PERIOD 
Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale ,COMMA into a sand dune .PERIOD 
In a way ,COMMA the static ,COMMA stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA moving mountains can be dangerous .PERIOD Let me try and explain why .PERIOD 
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces .PERIOD 
Some are already deserts ;SEMICOLON others are being seriously degraded by the sand .PERIOD 
The name means edge of the desert .PERIOD 
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification .PERIOD 
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid ,COMMA with about up to <NUM> dying .PERIOD 
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again .PERIOD 
And it's one that gets very little attention .PERIOD 
In our accelerated media culture ,COMMA desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines .PERIOD 
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina :COLON too few crying children and smashed up houses .PERIOD 
And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents ,COMMA affecting some <NUM> countries and about <NUM> percent of the world's agricultural drylands .PERIOD 
It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people ,COMMA and especially in Africa and China .PERIOD 
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we get climate change .PERIOD 
We get droughts ,COMMA increased desertification ,COMMA crashing food systems ,COMMA water scarcity ,COMMA famine ,COMMA forced migration ,COMMA political instability ,COMMA warfare ,COMMA crisis .PERIOD 
That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA how far away is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is .PERIOD 
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around <NUM> meters a year .PERIOD 
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land ,COMMA physically pushing people away from their homes .PERIOD 
Here I am -DASH -DASH I'm the second person on the left -DASH -DASH with the elders in Gidan-Kara ,COMMA a tiny village outside of Sokoto .PERIOD 
They had to move this village in <NUM> as a huge dune threatened to swallow it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they moved the entire village ,COMMA hut by hut .PERIOD 
This is where the village used to be .PERIOD 
It took us about <NUM> minutes to climb up to the top of that dune ,COMMA which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location .PERIOD 
That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to .PERIOD 
If you happen to live close to the desert border ,COMMA you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away ,COMMA and abandon your home and your life as you know it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts .PERIOD 
And still ,COMMA those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands .PERIOD 
Four years ago ,COMMA <NUM> African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara .PERIOD 
A fantastic project ,COMMA the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent ,COMMA from Mauritania in the west ,COMMA all the way to Djibouti in the east .PERIOD 
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving ,COMMA what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest .PERIOD 
And a good way of doing that ,COMMA the most efficient way ,COMMA is to use some kind of sand catcher .PERIOD 
Trees or cacti are good for this .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood .PERIOD 
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things .PERIOD 
It adds roughness to the dune's surface ,COMMA to the texture of the dune's surface ,COMMA binding the grains .PERIOD 
It provides a physical support structure for the trees ,COMMA and it creates physical spaces ,COMMA habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes .PERIOD 
If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees ,COMMA protect them from humans ,COMMA and from some of the forces of nature .PERIOD 
We can start harvesting condensation ,COMMA and start greening the desert from within .PERIOD 
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way .PERIOD 
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid ,COMMA and then excavate the sand ,COMMA and we have our architecture .PERIOD 
We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA by now ,COMMA you're probably asking ,COMMA how am I planning to solidify a sand dune ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do we glue those grains of sand together ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the answer is ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA that you use these guys ,COMMA Bacillus pasteurii ,COMMA a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes ,COMMA and does precisely that .PERIOD 
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it .PERIOD 
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process .PERIOD 
What happens is ,COMMA you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand ,COMMA and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains .PERIOD 
A chemical process produces calcite ,COMMA which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together .PERIOD 
The whole cementation process takes about <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
I learned about this from a professor at U.C .PERIOD Davis called Jason DeJong .PERIOD 
He managed to do it in a mere <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how much would this cost ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm not an economist ,COMMA very much not ,COMMA but I did ,COMMA quite literally ,COMMA a back of the envelope calculation -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA after an initial cost of <NUM> bucks to buy the bacteria ,COMMA which you'll never have to pay again ,COMMA one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
How do we construct something like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I'll quickly show you two options .PERIOD 
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure ,COMMA fill it with bacteria ,COMMA then allow the sand to wash over the balloon ,COMMA pop the balloon ,COMMA as it were ,COMMA disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA a few years afterwards ,COMMA using permacultural strategies ,COMMA we green that part of the desert .PERIOD 
The second alternative would be to use injection piles .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we pushed the piles down through the dune ,COMMA and we create an initial bacterial surface .PERIOD 
We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we have a way of turning sand into sandstone ,COMMA and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA what should they look like ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I realized that if I scaled them up ,COMMA they would provide me with good spatial qualities ,COMMA for ventilation ,COMMA for thermal comfort ,COMMA and for other things .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA as the bacteria do their work .PERIOD 
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually .PERIOD 
I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice .PERIOD 
We see the result ,COMMA the traces ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments .PERIOD 
Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably ,COMMA and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way .PERIOD 
It's a natural process .PERIOD It goes on in nature today ,COMMA and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them .PERIOD 
Sand-stopping devices ,COMMA made from sand .PERIOD 
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century .PERIOD 
In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands ,COMMA this could prove disastrous .PERIOD 
And quite frankly ,COMMA we're putting our heads in the sand .PERIOD 
If nothing else ,COMMA I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA if I had something like a TED wish ,COMMA it would be to actually get it built ,COMMA to start building this habitable wall ,COMMA this very ,COMMA very long ,COMMA but very narrow city in the desert ,COMMA built into the dunescape itself .PERIOD 
It's not only something that supports trees ,COMMA but something that connects people and countries together .PERIOD 
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure ,COMMA and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges .PERIOD 
Borges said that nothing is built on stone ,COMMA everything is built on sand ,COMMA but we must build as if the sand were stone .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there are many details left to explore in this scheme -DASH -DASH political ,COMMA practical ,COMMA ethical ,COMMA financial .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA it's a beginning ,COMMA it's a vision .PERIOD 
As Borges would have it ,COMMA it's the sand .PERIOD 
And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Hi ,COMMA my name is Marcin -DASH -DASH farmer ,COMMA technologist .PERIOD 
I was born in Poland ,COMMA now in the U.S .PERIOD 
I started a group called Open Source Ecology .PERIOD 
We've identified the <NUM> most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -DASH -DASH things from tractors ,COMMA bread ovens ,COMMA circuit makers .PERIOD 
Then we set out to create an open source ,COMMA DIY ,COMMA do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost .PERIOD 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set .PERIOD 
So let me tell you a story .PERIOD 
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D .PERIOD in fusion energy ,COMMA and I discovered I was useless .PERIOD 
I had no practical skills .PERIOD 
The world presented me with options ,COMMA and I took them .PERIOD 
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .PERIOD 
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming .PERIOD 
I bought a tractor -DASH -DASH then it broke .PERIOD 
I paid to get it repaired -DASH -DASH then it broke again .PERIOD 
Then pretty soon ,COMMA I was broke too .PERIOD 
I realized that the truly appropriate ,COMMA low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet .PERIOD 
I needed tools that were robust ,COMMA modular ,COMMA highly efficient and optimized ,COMMA low-cost ,COMMA made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime ,COMMA not designed for obsolescence .PERIOD 
I found that I would have to build them myself .PERIOD 
So I did just that .PERIOD 
And I tested them .PERIOD 
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .PERIOD 
So then I published the 3D designs ,COMMA schematics ,COMMA instructional videos and budgets on a wiki .PERIOD 
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up ,COMMA prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits .PERIOD 
So far ,COMMA we have prototyped eight of the <NUM> machines .PERIOD 
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .PERIOD 
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .PERIOD 
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .PERIOD 
We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways .PERIOD 
If we can lower the barriers to farming ,COMMA building ,COMMA manufacturing ,COMMA then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential .PERIOD 
That's not only in the developing world .PERIOD 
Our tools are being made for the American farmer ,COMMA builder ,COMMA entrepreneur ,COMMA maker .PERIOD 
We've seen lots of excitement from these people ,COMMA who can now start a construction business ,COMMA parts manufacturing ,COMMA organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid .PERIOD 
I've planted a hundred trees in a day .PERIOD 
I've pressed <NUM> bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .PERIOD 
From what I've seen ,COMMA this is only the beginning .PERIOD 
If this idea is truly sound ,COMMA then the implications are significant .PERIOD 
A greater distribution of the means of production ,COMMA environmentally sound supply chains ,COMMA and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .PERIOD 
We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
You all know this story .PERIOD 
In the summer of <NUM> ,COMMA Enrico Fermi ,COMMA the Italian-American physicist and atomic-pile builder ,COMMA went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there ,COMMA and asked them a question :COLON Where is everybody ?QUESTIONMARK 
This confused his colleagues ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA because they were sitting right there with him .PERIOD 
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them .PERIOD 
You see ,COMMA this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell ,COMMA New Mexico .PERIOD 
And even though that turned out to be nothing ,COMMA nothing at all -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths .. .PERIOD 
Still ,COMMA America had gone saucer-mad ,COMMA even famous scientists who were eating lunch .PERIOD 
Fermi's reasoning ,COMMA if I may paraphrase badly ,COMMA is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason ,COMMA there should be other intelligent life out there .PERIOD 
And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve ,COMMA we should have some evidence of their existence by now .PERIOD 
And yet ,COMMA to the best of our knowledge ,COMMA we are alone .PERIOD 
Where is everybody ?QUESTIONMARK asked Fermi ,COMMA and his colleagues had no answer .PERIOD 
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies ,COMMA Sasquatch ,COMMA God ,COMMA the possibility of love -DASH -DASH and thereafter ,COMMA as you know ,COMMA Enrico Fermi ate alone .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I am not a scientist .PERIOD 
Although ,COMMA I might argue that ,COMMA technically ,COMMA every pile is atomic .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA with respect ,COMMA I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider .PERIOD 
One is that the aliens might be very far away .PERIOD 
Perhaps ,COMMA I dare say ,COMMA even on other planets .PERIOD 
The other possibility -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH is ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA Enrico Fermi himself was an alien .PERIOD 
Isn't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War ,COMMA out of nowhere ,COMMA suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after ?QUESTIONMARK 
And isn't it a little strange that he required no payment for this ?QUESTIONMARK 
That he asked for only one thing -DASH -DASH a gift of two healthy sperm whales ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's -DASH -DASH that's not true .PERIOD 
But it is strange .PERIOD 
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien ,COMMA wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ?QUESTIONMARK 
For it is given in certain UFO-ology or UFOlogy circles ,COMMA that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia ;SEMICOLON that they have walked among us in disguise ,COMMA observing us ,COMMA guiding our evolution from ape to man -DASH -DASH if you believe in that sort of thing -DASH -DASH and ,COMMA occasionally ,COMMA kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids .PERIOD 
It's a difficult theory to discount ,COMMA I think you'll agree .PERIOD 
For even in my own life ,COMMA there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -DASH -DASH happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird ,COMMA that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life .PERIOD 
For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now ?QUESTIONMARK 
Encounter one :COLON Ocean City ,COMMA New Jersey ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
This was the summer when the special edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released .PERIOD 
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore .PERIOD 
Within <NUM> hours ,COMMA I was horribly sunburned ,COMMA just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie .PERIOD 
And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night ,COMMA the sidewalk still warm from the sun ,COMMA watching the skies for UFOs .PERIOD 
What did I see ?QUESTIONMARK Stars ,COMMA satellites ,COMMA blinking airplanes -DASH -DASH typical sky junk .PERIOD 
Occasionally ,COMMA kids would come and join me and watch ,COMMA but their necks soon got sore ,COMMA and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans .PERIOD 
And that's when it happened .PERIOD 
An elderly couple came walking down the street .PERIOD 
I would say they were in their late seventies ,COMMA and I would say that they were on a date ,COMMA because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie -DASH -DASH a brown suit .PERIOD 
And she was wearing a cardigan ,COMMA because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean .PERIOD 
I remember ,COMMA for some reason ,COMMA that they were exactly the same height .PERIOD 
And then they stopped ,COMMA and the man turned to me and said ,COMMA What are you looking for ,COMMA flying saucers ?QUESTIONMARK 
You have to admit ,COMMA that's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date .PERIOD 
But what was stranger still -DASH -DASH and even I realized it at the time ,COMMA as a nine-year-old child -DASH -DASH was that they stopped at all .PERIOD 
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA he said ,COMMA little green men .PERIOD 
And then his girlfriend joined in ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
There's no such thing as space men ,COMMA she said .PERIOD 
There's no such thing .PERIOD 
And then they both laughed .PERIOD Ha ,COMMA ha ,COMMA ha .PERIOD 
I looked around .PERIOD 
The street was entirely empty .PERIOD 
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean .PERIOD 
It was as though time had stopped .PERIOD 
I did not know why they were teasing me .PERIOD 
I looked into their strangely angry faces ,COMMA and I remember wondering ,COMMA are they wearing rubber masks ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what would be behind those rubber masks ,COMMA if they were ?QUESTIONMARK 
Giant ,COMMA almond-shaped ,COMMA unblinking eyes ?QUESTIONMARK 
Slits for mouths ?QUESTIONMARK 
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun ,COMMA and then he made laser sounds .PERIOD 
Kew ,COMMA kew ,COMMA kew -DASH -DASH watch out .PERIOD 
And they turned at once and walked away .PERIOD 
The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand ,COMMA and found it ,COMMA and left me alone .PERIOD 
Maybe it was swamp gas ,COMMA but -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH I know what I saw .PERIOD 
Close encounter two :COLON Brookline ,COMMA Massachusetts ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
I went to see the movie Dune ,COMMA and a girl talked to me .PERIOD Now ,COMMA on its face -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH this is impossible on its face ,COMMA I realize -DASH -DASH but it is absolutely true .PERIOD 
It was opening night ,COMMA naturally .PERIOD 
On my right was the girl in question .PERIOD 
She had long ,COMMA curly black hair ,COMMA a blue jean jacket .PERIOD 
She was very tall ,COMMA I would say .PERIOD 
I didn't know her name ,COMMA and I never will .PERIOD 
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother ,COMMA and they were talking about the novel ,COMMA Dune .PERIOD 
They were both big fans ,COMMA mother and daughter -DASH -DASH very unusual .PERIOD 
They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms .PERIOD 
And then it got stranger .PERIOD 
That's when she turned to me and said ,COMMA Are you looking forward to seeing the movie ?QUESTIONMARK 
First of all ,COMMA I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel Dune at that time .PERIOD 
I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets ,COMMA as I still am .PERIOD 
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question :COLON apropos of nothing ,COMMA like she didn't even care about the answer ,COMMA as though she just wanted to talk to me .PERIOD 
I did not know what to say .PERIOD I said ,COMMA Yes .PERIOD 
I did not even turn my head .PERIOD 
The movie began .PERIOD 
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of Dune ,COMMA in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time .PERIOD 
There was a character called the Third-Stage Guild Navigator ,COMMA which was a kind of giant ,COMMA floating fetus-creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him ,COMMA allowing him to bend space and time .PERIOD 
He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world .PERIOD 
He had become ,COMMA in his isolation ,COMMA so deformed and so sexy ,COMMA that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio to the outside world ,COMMA and could never touch them .PERIOD 
The sandworms were fine ,COMMA but your favorite character ?QUESTIONMARK 
Please .PERIOD 
When the movie ended ,COMMA everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible .PERIOD 
As I walked out ,COMMA her pace slowed .PERIOD 
Perhaps it was the crutches ,COMMA but it seemed -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again .PERIOD 
When I say it out loud ,COMMA it sounds so ridiculous ,COMMA but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what ,COMMA in the alien abductee community ,COMMA they call a screen memory :COLON a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -DASH -DASH say ,COMMA of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid .PERIOD 
And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her .PERIOD 
I sure am glad I never saw her again .PERIOD 
Close encounter three :COLON Philadelphia ,COMMA Pennsylvania ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
In the mid-to-late '80s ,COMMA the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called Communion ,COMMA in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens .PERIOD 
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as lost time ,COMMA where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes ,COMMA or the previous ten hours ,COMMA or the previous ten days .PERIOD 
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes .PERIOD 
This book became ,COMMA naturally ,COMMA an enormous best-seller .PERIOD 
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book ,COMMA and was his ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him .PERIOD 
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie .PERIOD 
And in <NUM> ,COMMA the way I remember it ,COMMA I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend ,COMMA and we decided ,COMMA apropos of nothing ,COMMA to go see this movie .PERIOD 
One :COLON Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken .PERIOD 
Two :COLON the alien was played by a rubber puppet .PERIOD 
Three :COLON there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe .PERIOD 
Four :COLON this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City ,COMMA Philadelphia .PERIOD 
Five :COLON all of which is to say ,COMMA they made a movie out of the book ,COMMA Communion ,COMMA and it starred Christopher Walken .PERIOD 
Does something seem strange about this to you ?QUESTIONMARK 
Something odd ?QUESTIONMARK Something off ?QUESTIONMARK Something wrong with this picture ?QUESTIONMARK 
Think about it .PERIOD Yes .PERIOD The answer is :COLON I had a girlfriend .PERIOD What ?QUESTIONMARK 
How did this happen ?QUESTIONMARK When did this happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact ,COMMA as we walked hand in hand ,COMMA and pondering these very same questions .PERIOD 
And to this day ,COMMA I have no answer for you .PERIOD 
Close encounter four :COLON the Algarve ,COMMA Portugal ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Some years later ,COMMA I and this woman -DASH -DASH we'll call her Catherine Fletcher -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH went traveling through the south of Portugal together .PERIOD 
We stayed in old ,COMMA crumbling ,COMMA walled cities ,COMMA in tiny little hotels ,COMMA and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers .PERIOD 
What ?QUESTIONMARK Did we do this ?QUESTIONMARK Really ?QUESTIONMARK Does anyone do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
We went to some topless beaches .PERIOD 
Excuse me ?QUESTIONMARK No ,COMMA not in my life .PERIOD 
For what it's worth ,COMMA we went to Sagres ,COMMA which was considered ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA to be the end of the world .PERIOD 
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock ,COMMA and the lead dog bit me on the ass ,COMMA requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot .PERIOD 
Make of that what you will .PERIOD 
Our last day in Portugal ,COMMA we were in the district capital of Faro ,COMMA and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Faro is a bustling little city ,COMMA and to get to the beach ,COMMA she explained ,COMMA you would have to take a bus and then a boat .PERIOD 
And did I want to come with ?QUESTIONMARK 
I remember what she looked like before she left .PERIOD 
The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders ,COMMA clustering into a kind of a tan .PERIOD 
A tan ,COMMA we were both tan -DASH -DASH is this true ?QUESTIONMARK 
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue ,COMMA as a result .PERIOD 
She was smiling .PERIOD 
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country ,COMMA not even speaking the language ,COMMA to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .PERIOD 
I loved her ,COMMA and then she went out into that strange ,COMMA alien land .PERIOD 
It took me some time to come to my senses .PERIOD 
I had my own lost time moment ,COMMA where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day ,COMMA almost dinnertime ,COMMA and she had not come back .PERIOD 
Nervous ,COMMA I went down to the street to look for her .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I did not speak Portuguese .PERIOD 
I did not know where the beach was .PERIOD 
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was <NUM> ,COMMA and the aliens had not given us that technology yet .PERIOD 
And so I sat down to wait .PERIOD 
I did not watch the skies ,COMMA but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along .PERIOD 
And I watched those constellations shift ,COMMA hoping that they would part and I would see her face .PERIOD 
It was at that moment ,COMMA in that very small town of <NUM> or so ,COMMA that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it .PERIOD 
And that's when the Liberians came along .PERIOD 
Five young men -DASH -DASH all laughing ,COMMA happy ,COMMA traveling together ,COMMA coming back to this hotel where they were staying .PERIOD 
One of them was named Joseph ,COMMA and he asked me what was I doing ,COMMA and I explained .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Don't worry .PERIOD He was sure that Catherine would be safe .PERIOD 
And for the next two hours ,COMMA they all waited with me :COLON taking turns ,COMMA going up to their room ,COMMA coming back ,COMMA telling me jokes ,COMMA distracting me .PERIOD 
Two hours ,COMMA they gave me a message .PERIOD 
We are not alone .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA in the middle of a sentence ,COMMA at the very birth of twilight ,COMMA I turned and looked down the street .PERIOD 
The stars aligned ,COMMA and she came back .PERIOD 
She was smiling .PERIOD She did not understand why I was so worried .PERIOD 
Neither did the Liberians ,COMMA although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back ,COMMA and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street ,COMMA holding hands .PERIOD 
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory ,COMMA much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a Portuguese doctor .PERIOD 
And even now ,COMMA a decade and a half later ,COMMA even now that we are married ,COMMA I look for her still ,COMMA whenever she is not in the room .PERIOD 
And even though ,COMMA I think you'll agree ,COMMA it is probable that during the time she was away ,COMMA she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone ,COMMA I love her and wait for her still .PERIOD 
Thank you for your kind attention .PERIOD 
I'm an ecologist ,COMMA mostly a coral reef ecologist .PERIOD 
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight .PERIOD 
And it was really a lot of fun for about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And that was what I did .PERIOD 
And I ended up in Jamaica ,COMMA in the West Indies ,COMMA where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary ,COMMA structurally ,COMMA that I ever saw in my life .PERIOD 
And this picture here ,COMMA it's really interesting ,COMMA it shows two things :COLON First of all ,COMMA it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far ,COMMA and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s ,COMMA you took pictures in black and white .PERIOD 
The other thing it shows you is that ,COMMA although there's this beautiful forest of coral ,COMMA there are no fish in that picture .PERIOD 
Those reefs at Discovery Bay ,COMMA Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
We were the best and the brightest .PERIOD 
People came to study our reefs from Australia ,COMMA which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .PERIOD 
And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work ,COMMA how they ought to be ,COMMA was based on these reefs without any fish .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA there was a hurricane ,COMMA Hurricane Allen .PERIOD 
I put half the lab up in my house .PERIOD 
The wind blew very strong .PERIOD 
The waves were <NUM> to <NUM> feet high .PERIOD 
And the reefs disappeared ,COMMA and new islands formed ,COMMA and we thought ,COMMA Well ,COMMA we're real smart .PERIOD 
And we published a paper in Science ,COMMA the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane .PERIOD 
And we predicted what would happen ,COMMA and we got it all wrong .PERIOD 
And the reason was because of overfishing ,COMMA and the fact that a last common grazer ,COMMA a sea urchin ,COMMA died .PERIOD 
And within a few months after that sea urchin dying ,COMMA the seaweed started to grow .PERIOD 
And that is the same reef ;SEMICOLON that's the same reef <NUM> years ago ;SEMICOLON that's the same reef today .PERIOD 
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .PERIOD 
And that's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean ,COMMA and increasingly ,COMMA tragically ,COMMA the coral reefs worldwide .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that's my little ,COMMA depressing story .PERIOD 
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories .PERIOD 
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there ,COMMA and it's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being ,COMMA because it just keeps getting worse .PERIOD 
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe ,COMMA like a hurricane ,COMMA it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery ,COMMA but what's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .PERIOD 
And so I'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .PERIOD 
It's difficult to imagine that two ,COMMA or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod .PERIOD 
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe .PERIOD 
It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles ,COMMA the song Jamaica Farewell -DASH -DASH Ackee rice salt fish are nice -DASH -DASH is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada .PERIOD 
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s :COLON <NUM> people lost their jobs .PERIOD 
And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not-so-tasty species ,COMMA from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world ,COMMA and what have you .PERIOD 
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from ,COMMA but it's still cheap ,COMMA and everybody thinks it's okay .PERIOD 
It's hard to communicate this ,COMMA and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish ,COMMA because people like to go out and catch fish .PERIOD 
It's one of those things .PERIOD 
This picture here shows the trophy fish ,COMMA the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat ,COMMA go to a place off of Key West in Florida ,COMMA drink a lot of beer ,COMMA throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water ,COMMA come back with the biggest and the best fish ,COMMA and the champion trophy fish are put on this board ,COMMA where people take a picture ,COMMA and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that's what it's like now ,COMMA but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock .PERIOD 
And the average size trophy fish weighed <NUM> to <NUM> pounds ,COMMA goliath grouper ,COMMA and if you wanted to go out and kill something ,COMMA you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish .PERIOD 
And they tasted really good .PERIOD 
And that's everywhere .PERIOD 
It's not just the fish ,COMMA though ,COMMA that are disappearing .PERIOD 
Industrial fishing uses big stuff ,COMMA big machinery .PERIOD 
We use nets that are <NUM> miles long .PERIOD 
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks .PERIOD 
And we trawl ,COMMA which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds ,COMMA put it on a big chain ,COMMA and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .PERIOD 
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest ,COMMA because it clears it away .PERIOD 
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable .PERIOD 
This is a photograph ,COMMA a typical photograph ,COMMA of what the continental shelves of the world look like .PERIOD 
What that was ,COMMA was a forest of sponges and coral ,COMMA which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .PERIOD 
What it is now is mud ,COMMA and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud ,COMMA to parking lot ,COMMA is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity .PERIOD 
We've managed to do that in the last <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days .PERIOD 
And all of that stuff is really disgusting ,COMMA but what's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .PERIOD 
And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution :COLON one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients .PERIOD 
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia ,COMMA the so-called killer algae .PERIOD 
A book was written about it .PERIOD 
It's a bit of an embarrassment .PERIOD 
It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco ,COMMA it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria .PERIOD 
It's very pretty ,COMMA and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean .PERIOD 
I don't know how many of you remember the movie The Little Shop of Horrors ,COMMA but this is the plant of The Little Shop of Horrors .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA instead of devouring the people in the shop ,COMMA what it's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea .PERIOD 
We don't know anything that eats it ,COMMA we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done ,COMMA but ,COMMA as it stands ,COMMA it's the monster from hell ,COMMA about which nobody knows what to do .PERIOD 
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients .PERIOD 
The green revolution ,COMMA all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer ,COMMA we use too much of it .PERIOD 
It's subsidized ,COMMA which is one of the reasons we used too much of it .PERIOD 
It runs down the rivers ,COMMA and it feeds the plankton ,COMMA the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .PERIOD 
But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton ,COMMA there's nothing to eat the plankton and there's more and more of it ,COMMA so it dies of old age ,COMMA which is unheard of for plankton .PERIOD 
And when it dies ,COMMA it falls to the bottom and then it rots ,COMMA which means that bacteria break it down .PERIOD 
And in the process they use up all the oxygen ,COMMA and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish ,COMMA as you see on the left in front of you .PERIOD 
And the only fishery left -DASH -DASH and it is a commercial fishery -DASH -DASH is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right ,COMMA where there used to be prawns .PERIOD 
Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod ,COMMA we now have a jellyfish fishery .PERIOD 
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .PERIOD 
That picture on the left is just staggering to me .PERIOD 
I have talked about it a million times ,COMMA but it's unbelievable .PERIOD 
In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta ,COMMA and the lower left of that picture is the Texas-Mexico border .PERIOD 
You're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico ;SEMICOLON you're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish ,COMMA made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right .PERIOD 
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore .PERIOD 
That's the same species .PERIOD 
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows ,COMMA and little droplets of the water get into the air ,COMMA the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress .PERIOD 
And that's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida .PERIOD 
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night ,COMMA and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what's going on .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA So ,COMMA imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota ,COMMA where it's clean and safe .PERIOD 
And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast ,COMMA because the coast ,COMMA instead of being paradise ,COMMA is harmful to your health .PERIOD 
And then this is amazing .PERIOD 
The reason that it attracted so much attention ,COMMA besides the fact that it's disgusting ,COMMA is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die ,COMMA and a farmer died of it ,COMMA and you can imagine the scandal that happened .PERIOD 
And so there's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all ,COMMA and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's climate change ,COMMA and we all know about climate change .PERIOD 
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea .PERIOD 
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA the Northwest Passage is already there .PERIOD 
I think it's sort of funny ;SEMICOLON it's on the Siberian coast ,COMMA maybe the Russians will charge tolls .PERIOD 
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously .PERIOD 
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders ,COMMA the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S .PERIOD and Canada ,COMMA whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA Arctic communities are toast .PERIOD 
The other kinds of effects of climate change -DASH -DASH this is coral bleaching .PERIOD It's a beautiful picture ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
All that white coral .PERIOD 
Except it's supposed to be brown .PERIOD 
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis ,COMMA and they have these little algal cells that live inside them .PERIOD 
And the algae give the corals sugar ,COMMA and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .PERIOD 
But when it gets too hot ,COMMA the algae can't make the sugar .PERIOD 
The corals say ,COMMA You cheated .PERIOD You didn't pay your rent .PERIOD 
They kick them out ,COMMA and then they die .PERIOD 
Not all of them die ;SEMICOLON some of them survive ,COMMA some more are surviving ,COMMA but it's really bad news .PERIOD 
To try and give you a sense of this ,COMMA imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America ,COMMA and you wake up the next morning ,COMMA and you look around you ,COMMA and you see that <NUM> percent of the trees ,COMMA as far as you can see ,COMMA have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked .PERIOD 
And you come home ,COMMA and you discover that <NUM> percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves .PERIOD 
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA a quarter of those died .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the <NUM> El Nino ,COMMA an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe ,COMMA when <NUM> percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died .PERIOD 
And then the really scary thing about all of this -DASH -DASH the overfishing ,COMMA the pollution and the climate change -DASH -DASH is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum .PERIOD 
But there are these ,COMMA what we call ,COMMA positive feedbacks ,COMMA the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts .PERIOD 
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this ,COMMA is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA because we ,COMMA at this point ,COMMA we can protect it .PERIOD 
But what does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
We really don't know .PERIOD 
So what are the oceans going to be like in <NUM> or <NUM> years ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there won't be any fish except for minnows ,COMMA and the water will be pretty dirty ,COMMA and all those kinds of things and full of mercury ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge ,COMMA and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global ,COMMA coastal ocean .PERIOD 
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it ,COMMA because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette .PERIOD 
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom ;SEMICOLON sometimes you don't .PERIOD 
That doesn't sell .PERIOD 
The really scary things though are the physical ,COMMA chemical ,COMMA oceanographic things that are happening .PERIOD 
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer ,COMMA the water is lighter when it's warmer ,COMMA it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .PERIOD 
We say it becomes more strongly stratified .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA at the same time ,COMMA water from the surface ,COMMA which is rich in oxygen ,COMMA doesn't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert .PERIOD 
So the question is :COLON How are we all going to respond to this ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we can do all sorts of things to fix it ,COMMA but in the final analysis ,COMMA the thing we really need to fix is ourselves .PERIOD 
It's not about the fish ;SEMICOLON it's not about the pollution ;SEMICOLON it's not about the climate change .PERIOD 
It's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today .PERIOD 
So the question is :COLON Will we respond to this or not ?QUESTIONMARK 
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I want to talk to you today about prosperity ,COMMA about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .PERIOD 
And not just us ,COMMA but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished .PERIOD 
And hope actually is at the heart of this .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity .PERIOD 
Pro-speras ,COMMA speras ,COMMA hope -DASH -DASH in accordance with our hopes and expectations .PERIOD 
The irony is ,COMMA though ,COMMA that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .PERIOD 
And we've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope -DASH -DASH running down resources ,COMMA cutting down rainforests ,COMMA spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico ,COMMA changing the climate -DASH -DASH and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession .PERIOD 
And recession ,COMMA of course ,COMMA isn't exactly a recipe for hope either ,COMMA as we're busy finding out .PERIOD 
So we're caught in a kind of trap .PERIOD 
It's a dilemma ,COMMA a dilemma of growth .PERIOD 
We can't live with it ;SEMICOLON we can't live without it .PERIOD 
Trash the system or crash the planet -DASH -DASH it's a tough choice ;SEMICOLON it isn't much of a choice .PERIOD 
And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently .PERIOD 
And I think we are a clever species sometimes .PERIOD 
But I think we should also just check the numbers ,COMMA take a reality check here .PERIOD 
So I want you to imagine a world ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA of around nine billion people ,COMMA all aspiring to Western incomes ,COMMA Western lifestyles .PERIOD 
And I want to ask the question -DASH -DASH and we'll give them that two percent hike in income ,COMMA in salary each year as well ,COMMA because we believe in growth .PERIOD 
And I want to ask the question :COLON how far and how fast would be have to move ?QUESTIONMARK 
How clever would we have to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ?QUESTIONMARK 
And here in my chart -DASH -DASH on the left-hand side is where we are now .PERIOD 
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .PERIOD 
It's around about <NUM> grams of carbon .PERIOD 
It's a 130-fold improvement ,COMMA and that is <NUM> times further and faster than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history .PERIOD 
Maybe we can do it ,COMMA maybe it's possible -DASH -DASH who knows ?QUESTIONMARK 
Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere ,COMMA which is what we're going to need to be doing by the end of the century .PERIOD 
But shouldn't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's a bit complex ,COMMA and I apologize for that .PERIOD 
What I'll try and do ,COMMA is I'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms .PERIOD 
Firms produce goods for households -DASH -DASH that's us -DASH -DASH and provide us with incomes ,COMMA and that's even better ,COMMA because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services .PERIOD 
It looks harmless enough .PERIOD 
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system ,COMMA which is the role of investment .PERIOD 
Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies ,COMMA but it plays an absolutely vital role .PERIOD 
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth .PERIOD 
It does this in a couple of ways -DASH -DASH chasing productivity ,COMMA which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff .PERIOD 
But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty ,COMMA the production and consumption of novelty .PERIOD 
Joseph Schumpeter called this the process of creative destruction .PERIOD 
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty ,COMMA continually chasing expanding consumer markets ,COMMA consumer goods ,COMMA new consumer goods .PERIOD 
And this ,COMMA this is where it gets interesting ,COMMA because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty .PERIOD 
We love new stuff -DASH -DASH new material stuff for sure -DASH -DASH but also new ideas ,COMMA new adventures ,COMMA new experiences .PERIOD 
But the materiality matters too ,COMMA because in every society that anthropologists have looked at ,COMMA material stuff operates as a kind of language -DASH -DASH a language of goods ,COMMA a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -DASH -DASH stories ,COMMA for example ,COMMA about how important we are .PERIOD 
Status-driven ,COMMA conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty .PERIOD 
And here ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -DASH -DASH the economic institutions ,COMMA and who we are as people ,COMMA locked together to drive an engine of growth .PERIOD 
And this engine is not just economic value ;SEMICOLON it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system ,COMMA driven by our own insatiable appetites ,COMMA driven in fact by a sense of anxiety .PERIOD 
Adam Smith ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA spoke about our desire for a life without shame .PERIOD 
A life without shame :COLON in his day ,COMMA what that meant was a linen shirt ,COMMA and today ,COMMA well ,COMMA you still need the shirt ,COMMA but you need the hybrid car ,COMMA the HDTV ,COMMA two holidays a year in the sun ,COMMA the netbook and iPad ,COMMA the list goes on -DASH -DASH an almost inexhaustible supply of goods ,COMMA driven by this anxiety .PERIOD 
And even if we don't want them ,COMMA we need to buy them ,COMMA because ,COMMA if we don't buy them ,COMMA the system crashes .PERIOD 
And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades ,COMMA we've expanded the money supply ,COMMA expanded credit and debt ,COMMA so that people can keep buying stuff .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis .PERIOD 
But this -DASH -DASH I just want to show you some data here .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA this credit and debt system ,COMMA just for the U.K .PERIOD 
This was the last <NUM> years before the crash ,COMMA and you can see there ,COMMA consumer debt rose dramatically .PERIOD 
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis .PERIOD 
And in the mean time ,COMMA personal savings absolutely plummeted .PERIOD 
The savings ratio ,COMMA net savings ,COMMA were below zero in the middle of <NUM> ,COMMA just before the crash .PERIOD 
This is people expanding debt ,COMMA drawing down their savings ,COMMA just to stay in the game .PERIOD 
This is a strange ,COMMA rather perverse ,COMMA story ,COMMA just to put it in very simple terms .PERIOD 
It's a story about us ,COMMA people ,COMMA being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about .PERIOD 
But before we consign ourselves to despair ,COMMA maybe we should just go back and say ,COMMA Did we get this right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is this really how people are ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is this really how economies behave ?QUESTIONMARK 
And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .PERIOD 
The first one is in the crisis itself .PERIOD 
In the crisis ,COMMA in the recession ,COMMA what do people want to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
They want to spend less and save more .PERIOD 
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view .PERIOD 
Keynes called this the paradox of thrift -DASH -DASH saving slows down recovery .PERIOD 
And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt ,COMMA to draw down our own savings even further ,COMMA just so that we can get the show back on the road ,COMMA so we can keep this growth-based economy going .PERIOD 
It's an anomaly ,COMMA it's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people .PERIOD 
Here's another one -DASH -DASH completely different one :COLON Why is it that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change ,COMMA very ,COMMA very simple things like buying energy-efficient appliances ,COMMA putting in efficient lights ,COMMA turning the lights off occasionally ,COMMA insulating our homes ?QUESTIONMARK 
These things save carbon ,COMMA they save energy ,COMMA they save us money .PERIOD 
So is it that ,COMMA though they make perfect economic sense ,COMMA we don't do them ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago .PERIOD 
It was a Sunday evening ,COMMA Sunday afternoon ,COMMA and it was just after -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA to be honest ,COMMA too long after -DASH -DASH we had moved into a new house .PERIOD 
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping ,COMMA installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts .PERIOD 
And my ,COMMA then ,COMMA five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .PERIOD 
And we'd been doing this for a while ,COMMA when she turned to me very solemnly and said ,COMMA Will this really keep out the giraffes ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here they are ,COMMA the giraffes .PERIOD 
You can hear the five-year-old mind working .PERIOD 
These ones ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA are <NUM> miles north of here outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria .PERIOD 
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather .PERIOD 
But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me ,COMMA because it suddenly became clear to me why we don't do the blindingly obvious things .PERIOD 
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes -DASH -DASH putting the kids on the bus in the morning ,COMMA getting ourselves to work on time ,COMMA surviving email overload and shop floor politics ,COMMA foraging for groceries ,COMMA throwing together meals ,COMMA escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime-time TV or TED online ,COMMA getting from one end of the day to the other ,COMMA keeping out the giraffes .PERIOD 
What is the objective ?QUESTIONMARK 
What is the objective of the consumer ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
It is ,COMMA she said ,COMMA to help create the social world and find a credible place in it .PERIOD 
That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives ,COMMA and it's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model .PERIOD 
So who are we ?QUESTIONMARK 
Who are these people ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt's lovely ,COMMA lovely sketch here ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -DASH -DASH a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .PERIOD 
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots ,COMMA so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -DASH -DASH fight or flight .PERIOD 
But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings .PERIOD 
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view ,COMMA another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation .PERIOD 
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself .PERIOD 
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups .PERIOD 
So here ,COMMA all of a sudden ,COMMA we're looking at a map of the human heart .PERIOD 
And it reveals to us ,COMMA suddenly ,COMMA the crux of the matter .PERIOD 
What we've done is we've created economies .PERIOD 
We've created systems ,COMMA which systematically privilege ,COMMA encourage ,COMMA one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded .PERIOD 
And in the same token ,COMMA the solution becomes clear ,COMMA because this isn't ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA about changing human nature .PERIOD 
It isn't ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA about curtailing possibilities .PERIOD 
It is about opening up .PERIOD 
What does all this mean for economics ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it might look a little bit like the <NUM> community-interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K .PERIOD over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States ,COMMA enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart -DASH -DASH companies ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA like this one ,COMMA Ecosia .PERIOD 
And I just want to ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA show you this .PERIOD 
Ecosia is an Internet search engine .PERIOD 
Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search .PERIOD 
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way .PERIOD 
So we can do that here -DASH -DASH we can just put in a little search term .PERIOD 
There you go ,COMMA Oxford ,COMMA that's where we are .PERIOD See what comes up .PERIOD 
The difference with Ecosia though is that ,COMMA in Ecosia's case ,COMMA it draws the revenues in the same way ,COMMA but it allocates <NUM> percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon .PERIOD 
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession ,COMMA that's the page to go to .PERIOD 
And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia ,COMMA and Ecosia is giving <NUM> percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project .PERIOD 
It's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources .PERIOD 
It's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy .PERIOD 
It's a form ,COMMA if you like ,COMMA of ecological altruism -DASH -DASH perhaps something along those lines .PERIOD Maybe it's that .PERIOD 
Whatever it is ,COMMA whatever this new economy is ,COMMA what we need the economy to do ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA is to put investment back into the heart of the model ,COMMA to re-conceive investment .PERIOD 
Only now ,COMMA investment isn't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth .PERIOD 
Investment has to be a different beast .PERIOD 
Investment has to be ,COMMA in the new economy ,COMMA protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends .PERIOD 
It has to be about transition .PERIOD 
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies and infrastructures .PERIOD 
We have to invest ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA in the idea of a meaningful prosperity ,COMMA providing capabilities for people to flourish .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA this task has material dimensions .PERIOD 
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn't have food ,COMMA clothing and shelter .PERIOD 
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .PERIOD 
It has social and psychological aims -DASH -DASH family ,COMMA friendship ,COMMA commitments ,COMMA society ,COMMA participating in the life of that society .PERIOD 
An investment -DASH -DASH investment ,COMMA after all ,COMMA is just such a basic economic concept -DASH -DASH is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future ,COMMA a shared present and a common future .PERIOD 
And we need that relationship to reflect ,COMMA to reclaim hope .PERIOD 
So let me come back ,COMMA with this sense of hope ,COMMA to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door .PERIOD 
What can we offer those people ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty .PERIOD 
It's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations .PERIOD 
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations ,COMMA a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth-based model .PERIOD 
So this is not just a Western post-materialist fantasy .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA an African philosopher wrote to me ,COMMA when Prosperity Without Growth was published ,COMMA pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu .PERIOD 
Ubuntu says ,COMMA I am because we are .PERIOD 
Prosperity is a shared endeavor .PERIOD 
Its roots are long and deep -DASH -DASH its foundations ,COMMA I've tried to show ,COMMA exist already ,COMMA inside each of us .PERIOD 
So this is not about standing in the way of development .PERIOD 
It's not about overthrowing capitalism .PERIOD 
It's not about trying to change human nature .PERIOD 
What we're doing here is we're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose .PERIOD 
And at the heart of that economics ,COMMA we're placing a more credible ,COMMA more robust ,COMMA and more realistic vision of what it means to be human .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA economists aren't supposed to be inspiring ,COMMA so you may need to work on the tone a little .PERIOD 
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying ,COMMA GDP fell two percent this year .PERIOD Good news !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
We're actually all happier ,COMMA and a country's more beautiful ,COMMA and our lives are better .PERIOD 
Tim Jackson :COLON Well that's clearly not what you're doing .PERIOD 
You're not making news out of things falling down .PERIOD 
Can I picture politicians doing it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Actually ,COMMA I already am seeing a little bit of it .PERIOD 
When we first started this kind of work ,COMMA politicians would stand up ,COMMA treasury spokesmen would stand up ,COMMA and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves .PERIOD 
And actually in the period through which we've been working over the last <NUM> years -DASH -DASH partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics -DASH -DASH actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world .PERIOD 
But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together ,COMMA or is it going to be more just civil society and companies ?QUESTIONMARK 
It has to be companies .PERIOD It has to be civil society .PERIOD 
This is a kind of agenda ,COMMA which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma ,COMMA because they're hooked on the growth model themselves .PERIOD 
But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing ,COMMA different kinds of politics ,COMMA and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently -DASH -DASH absolutely vital .PERIOD 
And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the -DASH -DASH what was it ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH the 130-fold improvement in efficiency ,COMMA of reduction of carbon footprint ,COMMA would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge-based goods ?QUESTIONMARK 
I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century ,COMMA in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere ,COMMA and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water .PERIOD 
If you can convince me we can do all that ,COMMA then ,COMMA yes ,COMMA I would take the two percent .PERIOD 
Tim ,COMMA thank you for a very important talk .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important ,COMMA long ,COMMA oily ,COMMA hot summer ,COMMA and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted .PERIOD 
But before I talk about the political chemistry ,COMMA I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil .PERIOD 
This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in <NUM> to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice .PERIOD 
And what you see here is ,COMMA you see a little bit of crude oil ,COMMA you see some ice cubes ,COMMA and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer .PERIOD 
We're four percent of the world's population ;SEMICOLON we use <NUM> percent of the world's oil production .PERIOD 
And we don't really understand what oil is ,COMMA until you check out its molecules ,COMMA And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn .PERIOD 
So this is what happens as that burn gets going .PERIOD 
It takes off .PERIOD It's a big woosh .PERIOD 
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday ,COMMA because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again .PERIOD 
It'll just bake your retinas .PERIOD 
So there it is ;SEMICOLON the retinas are baking .PERIOD 
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil .PERIOD 
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules .PERIOD 
It starts of with the very small ones ,COMMA which are one carbon ,COMMA four hydrogen -DASH -DASH that's methane -DASH -DASH it just floats off .PERIOD 
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon .PERIOD 
You've probably heard of benzene rings ;SEMICOLON they're very carcinogenic .PERIOD 
And it goes all the way over to these big ,COMMA thick ,COMMA galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons ,COMMA and they have thousands of hydrogens ,COMMA and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them .PERIOD 
Those are called the asphaltenes ;SEMICOLON they're an ingredient in asphalt .PERIOD 
They're very important in oil spills .PERIOD 
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water .PERIOD 
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous .PERIOD 
If it sank ,COMMA it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill .PERIOD 
It spreads out to be really thin ,COMMA so you have a hard time corralling it .PERIOD 
The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate ,COMMA and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that ,COMMA and shrimp .PERIOD 
And then the asphaltenes -DASH -DASH and this is the crucial thing -DASH -DASH the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion ,COMMA something like mayonnaise .PERIOD 
It also makes it very viscous .PERIOD 
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain ,COMMA there were big ,COMMA floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil ,COMMA with the consistency ,COMMA or the viscosity ,COMMA of chewing gum .PERIOD 
It's incredibly hard to clean up .PERIOD 
And every single oil is different when it hits water .PERIOD 
For the first time ,COMMA American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves .PERIOD 
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics ,COMMA because it's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important ,COMMA why we need to stay focused .PERIOD 
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks ,COMMA Wow !EXCLAMATIONMARK I'm going to go buy some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA they think ,COMMA Ugh .PERIOD I have to go buy gas .PERIOD 
I'm so angry about it .PERIOD The oil companies are ripping me off .PERIOD 
They set the prices ,COMMA and I don't even know .PERIOD 
I am helpless over this .PERIOD 
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump -DASH -DASH and actually ,COMMA gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger .PERIOD 
I've talked to engineers .PERIOD That's specifically to diffuse our anger ,COMMA because supposedly we feel good about ATMs .PERIOD 
That shows you how bad it is .PERIOD 
But actually ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy ,COMMA not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market .PERIOD 
And the thing is ,COMMA too ,COMMA is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume ,COMMA which is somewhat reasonable ,COMMA because in fact ,COMMA we have designed this system where ,COMMA if you want to get a job ,COMMA it's much more important to have a car that runs ,COMMA to have a job and keep a job ,COMMA than to have a GED .PERIOD 
And that's actually very perverse .PERIOD 
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas ,COMMA which is that we'd rather be doing anything else .PERIOD 
This is BP's gas station in downtown Los Angeles .PERIOD 
It is green .PERIOD It is a shrine to greenishness .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you think ,COMMA why would something so lame work on people so smart ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA the reason is ,COMMA is because ,COMMA when we're buying gas ,COMMA we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else .PERIOD 
We don't want to be buying oil ;SEMICOLON we want to be doing something green .PERIOD 
And we get kind of in on our own con .PERIOD 
I mean -DASH -DASH and this is funny ,COMMA it looks funny here .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA that's why the slogan beyond petroleum worked .PERIOD 
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy ,COMMA which is we don't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use .PERIOD 
We talk about energy independence .PERIOD We talk about hydrogen cars .PERIOD 
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil ,COMMA and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States .PERIOD 
The oil industry is like a huge ,COMMA gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else ,COMMA but we actually see it in very moral terms .PERIOD 
This is an early-on photograph -DASH -DASH you can see ,COMMA we had these gushers .PERIOD 
But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing .PERIOD 
They weren't farmers ,COMMA they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground .PERIOD 
It's the Beverly Hillbillies ,COMMA basically .PERIOD 
But in the beginning ,COMMA this was seen as a very morally problematic thing ,COMMA long before it became funny .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there was John D .PERIOD Rockefeller .PERIOD 
It was terrifying ;SEMICOLON you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now ,COMMA imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s .PERIOD 
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy .PERIOD 
But what's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell ,COMMA the journalist ,COMMA went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place .PERIOD 
But in many ways ,COMMA that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us .PERIOD 
And here's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -DASH -DASH she said ,COMMA He has a thin nose like a thorn .PERIOD 
There were no lips .PERIOD 
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so that guy is actually still with us .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA this is a very pervasive -DASH -DASH this is part of our DNA .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you might be wondering why it is that ,COMMA every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill ,COMMA we call these CEOs down to Washington ,COMMA and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them .PERIOD 
And this is something that we've been doing since <NUM> ,COMMA when we first asked them ,COMMA Why are there these obscene profits ?QUESTIONMARK 
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs .PERIOD 
And we take it as ,COMMA you know -DASH -DASH we look at it on a moral level ,COMMA rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .PERIOD 
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions -DASH -DASH I'm just saying that ,COMMA when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards ,COMMA you don't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate ,COMMA or you're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil .PERIOD 
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction .PERIOD 
But it makes for good theater ,COMMA and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA these pictures -DASH -DASH this is from the Santa Barbara spill .PERIOD 
You have these pictures of birds .PERIOD 
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in <NUM> ,COMMA it formed the environmental movement in its modern form .PERIOD 
It started Earth Day .PERIOD 
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act ,COMMA the Clean Air Act ,COMMA the Clean Water Act .PERIOD 
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us .PERIOD 
Here we are normally ;SEMICOLON we're standing at the gas pump ,COMMA and we're feeling kind of helpless .PERIOD 
We look at these pictures and we understand ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA our role in this supply chain .PERIOD 
We connect the dots in the supply chain .PERIOD 
And we have this kind of -DASH -DASH as voters ,COMMA we have kind of a eureka !EXCLAMATIONMARK moment .PERIOD 
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important .PERIOD 
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it .PERIOD 
We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem .PERIOD 
We were very reactive ,COMMA as opposed to being proactive about what happened .PERIOD 
And so what we did was ,COMMA actually ,COMMA we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling .PERIOD 
We stopped drilling in ANWR ,COMMA but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it's continued to increase .PERIOD 
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out .PERIOD 
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves ;SEMICOLON <NUM> percent of them are in the Persian Gulf .PERIOD 
One of the things that's happened because of this is that ,COMMA since <NUM> ,COMMA the country of Nigeria ,COMMA or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil ,COMMA which is the delta -DASH -DASH which is two times the size of Maryland -DASH -DASH has had thousands of oil spills a year .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA we've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations .PERIOD 
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since <NUM> .PERIOD 
And we can wrap our heads around the spills ,COMMA because that's what we see here ,COMMA but in fact ,COMMA these guys actually live in a war zone .PERIOD 
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland ,COMMA and it's all related to the oil .PERIOD 
They have degrees in political science ,COMMA degrees in business -DASH -DASH they're entrepreneurs .PERIOD They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing .PERIOD 
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us .PERIOD 
The other thing that we've done ,COMMA as we've continued to increase demand ,COMMA is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs .PERIOD 
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad ,COMMA with Exxon .PERIOD 
So the U.S .PERIOD taxpayer paid for it ;SEMICOLON the World Bank ,COMMA Exxon paid for it .PERIOD 
We put it in .PERIOD There was a tremendous banditry problem .PERIOD 
I was there in <NUM> .PERIOD 
We were driving along this dark ,COMMA dark road ,COMMA and the guy in the green stepped out ,COMMA and I was just like ,COMMA Ahhh !EXCLAMATIONMARK This is it .PERIOD 
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields .PERIOD 
But at the same time ,COMMA Chad has become much more unstable ,COMMA and we are not paying for that price at the pump .PERIOD 
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th .PERIOD 
We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open .PERIOD 
This is <NUM> -DASH -DASH we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year .PERIOD 
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S .PERIOD involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump .PERIOD 
We pay for it on April 15th ,COMMA and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement .PERIOD 
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico ,COMMA which was not part of the moratoriums .PERIOD 
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -DASH -DASH as you can see ,COMMA this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil .PERIOD 
It's become this intense industrialized zone .PERIOD 
It doesn't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has ,COMMA but it should ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA it's a bird sanctuary .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA every time you buy gasoline in the United States ,COMMA half of it is actually being refined along the coast ,COMMA because the Gulf actually has about <NUM> percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well .PERIOD 
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA American families also pay a price for oil .PERIOD 
Now on the one hand ,COMMA the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil ,COMMA but on the other hand ,COMMA the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work ,COMMA generally in a fairly crummy car .PERIOD 
If you look at people who make $50 ,COMMA <NUM> a year ,COMMA they have two kids ,COMMA they might have three jobs or more ,COMMA and then they have to really commute .PERIOD 
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care .PERIOD 
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile ,COMMA around <NUM> .PERIOD 
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy ,COMMA but they're also a drain on individual families and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher .PERIOD 
What are the laws ?QUESTIONMARK What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ?QUESTIONMARK 
One thing is -DASH -DASH we need to stay away from the theater .PERIOD 
We need to stay away from the moratoriums .PERIOD 
We need to focus really back again on the molecules .PERIOD 
The moratoriums are fine ,COMMA but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil .PERIOD 
One of the things that we also need to do ,COMMA is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world ,COMMA before you reduce the amount of oil that we use .PERIOD 
We need to focus on reducing the oil .PERIOD 
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S .PERIOD economy .PERIOD 
It comes in on the side -DASH -DASH the useful stuff is the dark gray ,COMMA and the un-useful stuff ,COMMA which is called the rejected energy -DASH -DASH the waste ,COMMA goes up to the top .PERIOD 
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount .PERIOD 
And one of the things that we need to do is ,COMMA not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient ,COMMA but we also need to fix the economy in general .PERIOD 
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA we have an insurance system where the person who drives <NUM> miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives <NUM> .PERIOD 
We actually encourage people to drive more .PERIOD 
We have policies that reward sprawl -DASH -DASH we have all kinds of policies .PERIOD 
We need to have more mobility choices .PERIOD 
We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil .PERIOD 
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry ,COMMA which is at least <NUM> billion dollars a year ,COMMA into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute .PERIOD 
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road ,COMMA this is where we need to be .PERIOD 
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing ,COMMA and you can find more about this policy .PERIOD 
It's called STRONG ,COMMA which is Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually ,COMMA and the idea is instead of being helpless ,COMMA we need to be more strong .PERIOD 
They're up at NewAmerica.net .PERIOD 
What's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump ,COMMA to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are ,COMMA having kind of that special moment ,COMMA where we connect the dots actually at the pump .PERIOD 
Now supposedly ,COMMA oil taxes are the third rail of American politics -DASH -DASH the no-fly zone .PERIOD 
I actually -DASH -DASH I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much ,COMMA but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline ,COMMA and upped it to six cents next year ,COMMA nine cents the following year ,COMMA all the way up to <NUM> cents by <NUM> ,COMMA that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption ,COMMA and at the same time we would give people time to prepare ,COMMA time to respond ,COMMA and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time .PERIOD 
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work .PERIOD 
This is a gas receipt ,COMMA hypothetically ,COMMA for a year from now .PERIOD 
The first thing that you have on the tax is -DASH -DASH you have a tax for a stronger America -DASH -DASH <NUM> cents .PERIOD 
So you're not helpless at the pump .PERIOD 
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign ,COMMA very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack .PERIOD 
And what it says is ,COMMA The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates <NUM> cents in health care costs .PERIOD 
That's a lot .PERIOD 
And so this -DASH -DASH you can see that you're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system .PERIOD 
And at the same time ,COMMA you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting ,COMMA or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car ,COMMA or whatever it is you're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence .PERIOD 
With this whole sort of suite of policies ,COMMA we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -DASH -DASH or our oil consumption -DASH -DASH by <NUM> percent by <NUM> .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA three million barrels a day .PERIOD 
But in order to do this ,COMMA one of the things we really need to do ,COMMA is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon .PERIOD 
We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater ,COMMA not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I'd like to ask you ,COMMA what do these three people have in common ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA you probably recognize the first person .PERIOD 
I'm sure you're all avid American Idol watchers .PERIOD 
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani ,COMMA who is a contestant ,COMMA indeed a finalist ,COMMA in the Poet of the Millions competition ,COMMA which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi ,COMMA and seen throughout the Arab world .PERIOD 
In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry ,COMMA in the Nabati form of poetry ,COMMA which is the traditional Bedouin form .PERIOD 
And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA before I go any further ,COMMA yes ,COMMA I know it all began with Britain's Got Talent .PERIOD 
But my point in discussing this is to show you -DASH -DASH I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions ,COMMA with equal access to everyone ,COMMA with the winner selected via voting by SMS ,COMMA are changing tribal societies .PERIOD 
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE ,COMMA how they're changing tribal societies ,COMMA not by introducing Western ideas ,COMMA but by being integrated into the language in those places .PERIOD 
It all begins with enjoyment .PERIOD 
Video :COLON We are late to watch Afghan Star .PERIOD 
We are going to watch Afghan Star .PERIOD We are late .PERIOD 
We are running late .PERIOD 
We must go to watch Afghan Star .PERIOD 
In Afghanistan ,COMMA people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program .PERIOD 
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set .PERIOD 
People watch it all over the country also in public places .PERIOD 
But it goes beyond watching ,COMMA because also ,COMMA part of this is campaigning .PERIOD 
Contestants also put themselves forward .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance ,COMMA but not entirely .PERIOD 
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group .PERIOD 
This has opened up the door ,COMMA particularly for women .PERIOD 
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists .PERIOD 
And here she relates ,COMMA in the documentary film Afghan Star ,COMMA how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .PERIOD 
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her .PERIOD 
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out ,COMMA to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition .PERIOD 
I have to say ,COMMA her husband backed her from the start .PERIOD 
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA once she started to win ,COMMA then they got behind her again .PERIOD 
And she's out there .PERIOD 
Her poetry is about women ,COMMA and the life of women in society .PERIOD 
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -DASH -DASH this shows the voting on the program -DASH -DASH it sets a very important example for young women -DASH -DASH these are young women in the audience of the program -DASH -DASH in Abu Dhabi ,COMMA but also people in the viewing audience .PERIOD 
Now you'd think that American Idol would introduce a measure of Americanization .PERIOD 
But actually ,COMMA just the opposite is happening .PERIOD 
By using this engaging popular format for traditional ,COMMA local culture ,COMMA it actually ,COMMA in the Gulf ,COMMA is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry ,COMMA also in traditional dress and dance and music .PERIOD 
And for Afghanistan ,COMMA where the Taliban banned music for many years ,COMMA it is reintroducing their traditional music .PERIOD 
They don't sing pop songs ,COMMA they sing Afghan music .PERIOD 
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully ,COMMA without avenging the winner .PERIOD 
No small thing .PERIOD 
And the final ,COMMA sort of ,COMMA formulation of this American Idol format ,COMMA which has just appeared in Afghanistan ,COMMA is a new program called The Candidate .PERIOD 
And in this program ,COMMA people present policy platforms that are then voted on .PERIOD 
Many of them are too young to run for president ,COMMA but by putting the issues out there ,COMMA they are influencing the presidential race .PERIOD 
So for me ,COMMA the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Last year when I was here ,COMMA I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole .PERIOD 
And while that swim took place three years ago ,COMMA I can remember it as if it was yesterday .PERIOD 
I remember standing on the edge of the ice ,COMMA about to dive into the water ,COMMA and thinking to myself ,COMMA I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening .PERIOD 
The water is completely black .PERIOD 
The water is minus <NUM> degrees centigrade ,COMMA or <NUM> degrees Fahrenheit .PERIOD 
It's flipping freezing in that water .PERIOD 
And then I said to myself ,COMMA I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .PERIOD 
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up ,COMMA listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy ,COMMA and then committing myself a hundred percent -DASH -DASH there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -DASH -DASH and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .PERIOD 
And that swim took me <NUM> minutes and <NUM> seconds ,COMMA and it felt like <NUM> days .PERIOD 
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers ,COMMA and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA we're made partially of water -DASH -DASH when water freezes it expands ,COMMA and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .PERIOD 
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following :COLON I'm never ,COMMA ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA last year ,COMMA I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -DASH -DASH and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change .PERIOD 
I heard about this lake ,COMMA Lake Imja .PERIOD 
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier .PERIOD 
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .PERIOD 
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great ,COMMA big battleground on this earth .PERIOD 
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is ,COMMA and with the water supply from these glaciers -DASH -DASH because of climate change -DASH -DASH decreasing so much ,COMMA I think we have a real risk of instability .PERIOD 
North ,COMMA you've got China ;SEMICOLON south ,COMMA you've India ,COMMA Pakistan ,COMMA Bangladesh ,COMMA all these countries .PERIOD 
And so I decided to walk up to Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA the highest mountain on this earth ,COMMA and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt .PERIOD Everest .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA but it's quite an ordeal getting up there .PERIOD 
<NUM> great ,COMMA big ,COMMA powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -DASH -DASH I don't just have my Speedo ,COMMA but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world .PERIOD 
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude .PERIOD 
I wanted to do the swim at <NUM> meters above sea level .PERIOD 
So it's right up in the heavens .PERIOD 
It's very ,COMMA very difficult to breath .PERIOD You get altitude sickness .PERIOD 
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .PERIOD 
That's not the worst part of it .PERIOD 
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt .PERIOD Everest .PERIOD 
Many ,COMMA many people have died on Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .PERIOD 
And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA no fish -DASH -DASH there are no fish up there swimming at <NUM> meters -DASH -DASH When you're trying to do that ,COMMA and then the bodies are coming past you ,COMMA it humbles you ,COMMA and you also realize very ,COMMA very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .PERIOD 
And we walked up this pathway ,COMMA all the way up .PERIOD 
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier .PERIOD 
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .PERIOD 
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself ,COMMA for this swim which was going to be so very difficult .PERIOD 
I put on my iPod ,COMMA I listened to some music ,COMMA I got myself as aggressive as possible -DASH -DASH but controlled aggression -DASH -DASH and then I hurled myself into that water .PERIOD 
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters ,COMMA and then I realized very ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA I had a huge problem on my hands .PERIOD 
I could barely breathe .PERIOD 
I was gasping for air .PERIOD 
I then began to choke ,COMMA and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .PERIOD 
And it all happened so quickly :COLON I then -DASH -DASH I don't know how it happened -DASH -DASH but I went underwater .PERIOD 
And luckily ,COMMA the water was quite shallow ,COMMA and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .PERIOD 
And then I said ,COMMA carry on .PERIOD Carry on .PERIOD Carry on .PERIOD 
And I don't where I got it from ,COMMA but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .PERIOD 
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .PERIOD 
I have never ,COMMA ever heard such utter bollocks .PERIOD 
I got myself to the side of the lake .PERIOD 
My crew grabbed me ,COMMA and then we walked as quickly as we could down -DASH -DASH over the rubble -DASH -DASH down to our camp .PERIOD 
And my team just gave it to me straight .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA Lewis ,COMMA you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim .PERIOD 
Every single thing which you have learned in the past <NUM> years of swimming ,COMMA you must forget .PERIOD 
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army ,COMMA about speed and aggression ,COMMA you put that to one side .PERIOD 
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time .PERIOD 
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time ,COMMA and instead of swimming fast ,COMMA swim as slowly as possible .PERIOD 
Instead of swimming crawl ,COMMA swim breaststroke .PERIOD 
And remember ,COMMA never ever swim with aggression .PERIOD 
This is the time to swim with real humility .PERIOD 
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .PERIOD 
And I stood there on the edge of the lake ,COMMA and I looked up at Mt .PERIOD Everest -DASH -DASH and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -DASH -DASH and I said to myself ,COMMA just do this slowly .PERIOD 
And I swam across the lake .PERIOD 
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side .PERIOD 
But I learned two very ,COMMA very important lessons there on Mt .PERIOD Everest ,COMMA and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .PERIOD 
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well ,COMMA doesn't mean it's going to work in the future .PERIOD 
And similarly ,COMMA now ,COMMA before I do anything ,COMMA I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task .PERIOD 
And taking that into the world of climate change -DASH -DASH which is ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA the Mt .PERIOD Everest of all problems -DASH -DASH just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long ,COMMA just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long ,COMMA doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .PERIOD 
The warning signs are all there .PERIOD 
When I was born ,COMMA the world's population was <NUM> billion people .PERIOD 
We're now <NUM> billion people ,COMMA and we're expected to be <NUM> billion people by <NUM> .PERIOD 
And then the second lesson ,COMMA the radical ,COMMA tactical shift .PERIOD 
And I've come here to ask you today :COLON what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment ,COMMA which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world ,COMMA and most importantly ,COMMA in a sustainable world ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I ask you ,COMMA please ,COMMA to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make ,COMMA which will make that big difference ,COMMA and then commit a hundred percent to doing it .PERIOD 
Blog about it ,COMMA tweet about it ,COMMA talk about it ,COMMA and commit a hundred percent ,COMMA because very ,COMMA very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .PERIOD 
So thank you very ,COMMA very much .PERIOD 
So anyway ,COMMA who am I ?QUESTIONMARK 
I usually say to people ,COMMA when they say ,COMMA What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event ,COMMA to which he replied ,COMMA How quaint .PERIOD 
And I sort of really was dumbstruck .PERIOD 
And I really should have said something smart .PERIOD 
And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it ,COMMA I would have said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if we look at the next <NUM> years and we've seen all these problems in the last few days ,COMMA most of the big issues -DASH -DASH clean water ,COMMA clean energy -DASH -DASH and they're interchangeable in some respects -DASH -DASH and cleaner ,COMMA more functional materials -DASH -DASH they all look to me to be hardware problems .PERIOD 
This doesn't mean we should ignore software ,COMMA or information ,COMMA or computation .PERIOD 
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about do this ,COMMA do that and you fill out all these forms ,COMMA and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you ,COMMA and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist .PERIOD 
And I've always been nervous about the term futurist ,COMMA because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it .PERIOD 
And George Homsey ,COMMA a great guy ,COMMA said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA the future is amazing .PERIOD 
It is so much stranger than you think .PERIOD 
We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut ,COMMA and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you may think that's sort of really crazy ,COMMA but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this isn't my work ,COMMA but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT .PERIOD 
This is called the registry of standard biological parts .PERIOD 
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very ,COMMA very bright individuals .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is actually becoming such an interesting idea .PERIOD 
This is a state diagram .PERIOD That's an extremely simple computer .PERIOD 
This one is a two-bit counter .PERIOD 
So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches .PERIOD 
And from the results of the same competition last year ,COMMA a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off .PERIOD 
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do if-then-for statements in materials ,COMMA in structure .PERIOD 
This is a pretty interesting trend ,COMMA because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly ,COMMA Form follows function ,COMMA but I think I've sort of grown up in a world -DASH -DASH you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday ;SEMICOLON I was in a lab associated with his -DASH -DASH where it's really a world where information defines form and function .PERIOD 
I spent six years thinking about that ,COMMA but to show you the power of art over science -DASH -DASH this is actually one of the cartoons I write .PERIOD These are called HowToons .PERIOD 
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta .PERIOD 
He's an interesting little kid -DASH -DASH and his sister ,COMMA Celine -DASH -DASH and what he's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl .PERIOD 
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things ,COMMA so he starts chocolate-dipping edges ,COMMA changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity .PERIOD 
In theory ,COMMA if you program those sufficiently ,COMMA you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure .PERIOD 
In this case ,COMMA he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure .PERIOD 
And that's what I thought about for a long time ,COMMA because this is how we currently make things .PERIOD 
This is a silicon wafer ,COMMA and essentially that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff ,COMMA sort of layered up .PERIOD 
The feature side is -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA people will say ,COMMA [unclear] down around about <NUM> nanometers now .PERIOD 
On the right ,COMMA that's a radiolara .PERIOD 
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans .PERIOD 
And that has feature sizes down to about <NUM> nanometers ,COMMA and it's a complex 3D structure .PERIOD 
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way .PERIOD 
The secret to biology is ,COMMA it builds computation into the way it makes things .PERIOD So this little thing here ,COMMA polymerase ,COMMA is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA .PERIOD 
I thought about this in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials ,COMMA but can we do similar things ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems ,COMMA like higher speed semiconductors ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system .PERIOD 
And this is sort of Babbage's revenge .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's about three light switches lined up .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if I make a string of these ,COMMA a bit string ,COMMA they will be able to replicate .PERIOD 
So we start with white ,COMMA blue ,COMMA blue ,COMMA white .PERIOD 
That encodes ;SEMICOLON that will now copy .PERIOD From one comes two ,COMMA and then from two comes three .PERIOD 
And so you've got this sort of replicating system .PERIOD 
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose ,COMMA father of Roger Penrose ,COMMA the tiles guy .PERIOD 
He did a lot of this work in the '60s ,COMMA and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution ,COMMA but it's now coming back .PERIOD 
So we've tracked in the video the input string ,COMMA which was green ,COMMA green ,COMMA yellow ,COMMA yellow ,COMMA green .PERIOD 
We set them off on this air hockey table .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA high science uses air hockey tables -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy ,COMMA but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here .PERIOD 
So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why would you want to replicate bit strings ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme ,COMMA that you can take a linear string ,COMMA which is a convenient thing to copy ,COMMA and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure .PERIOD 
So I was trying to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA take the engineer's version :COLON Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape -DASH -DASH the B -DASH -DASH assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .PERIOD 
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here ,COMMA and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design ,COMMA was that you don't need digital logic to do computation .PERIOD 
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips .PERIOD 
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process .PERIOD 
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles .PERIOD 
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity ,COMMA and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that ,COMMA and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I can now take a dog ,COMMA carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence .PERIOD And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently .PERIOD 
And the universe is now a compiler .PERIOD 
And so I'm thinking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what are the programs for programming the physical universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point ,COMMA but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic ,COMMA are the computers .PERIOD 
Having totally absorbed this philosophy ,COMMA I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently .PERIOD 
With the universe as a computer ,COMMA you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations .PERIOD 
You set a couple of boundary conditions ,COMMA like gravity ,COMMA the surface tension ,COMMA density ,COMMA etc. ,COMMA and then you press execute ,COMMA and magically ,COMMA the universe produces you a perfect ball lens .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this actually applied to the problem of -DASH -DASH so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world don't have access to cheap eyeglasses .PERIOD 
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ?QUESTIONMARK 
If it's circular ,COMMA you make a spherical lens .PERIOD 
If it's elliptical ,COMMA you can make an astigmatic lens .PERIOD 
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -DASH -DASH so that's part of the extra program .PERIOD 
And literally with only those two inputs -DASH -DASH so ,COMMA the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -DASH -DASH you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error ,COMMA from minus <NUM> to plus eight diopters ,COMMA up to four diopters of cylinder .PERIOD 
And then literally ,COMMA you now pour on a monomer .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA I'll do a Julia Childs here .PERIOD 
This is three minutes of UV light .PERIOD 
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it .PERIOD Pop it out .PERIOD 
I've seen this video ,COMMA but I still don't know if it's going to end right .PERIOD 
So you reverse this .PERIOD This is a very old movie ,COMMA so with the new prototypes ,COMMA actually both surfaces are flexible ,COMMA but this will show you the point .PERIOD 
Now you've finished the lens ,COMMA you literally pop it out .PERIOD 
That's next year's Yves Klein ,COMMA you know ,COMMA eyeglasses shape .PERIOD 
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters .PERIOD 
And as I rotate it against this side shot ,COMMA you'll see that that has cylinder ,COMMA and that was programmed in -DASH -DASH literally into the physics of the system .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things ,COMMA like this .PERIOD 
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment ,COMMA called electronic rope .PERIOD 
So literally ,COMMA you think about a rope .PERIOD It has very complex structure in the weave .PERIOD 
And under no load ,COMMA it's one structure .PERIOD 
Under a different load ,COMMA it's a different structure .PERIOD And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor .PERIOD 
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope .PERIOD 
Just by thinking about the physics of the world ,COMMA materials as the computer ,COMMA you can start to do things like this .PERIOD 
I'm going to segue a little here .PERIOD 
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this .PERIOD 
One thing I'm really interested about this right now is ,COMMA how ,COMMA if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer ,COMMA how do we make things in a very general sense ,COMMA and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ?QUESTIONMARK 
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems ,COMMA share the information and work on those things together .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time ,COMMA and unless Lisa Randall changes that ,COMMA we'll continue to move in linear time .PERIOD 
So that means anything you do ,COMMA or anything you make ,COMMA you produce a sequence of steps -DASH -DASH and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this ,COMMA and they did it most elegantly .PERIOD 
But they can show you how to build things in sequence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I'm thinking about ,COMMA how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things ,COMMA so you end up with this sort of guy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I think this applies across a very broad -DASH -DASH sort of ,COMMA a lot of concepts .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA Cameron Sinclair yesterday said ,COMMA How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity ?QUESTIONMARK 
And if you've seen Amy Smith ,COMMA she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti .PERIOD 
And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things ,COMMA so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other's source code for structure .PERIOD 
I don't know exactly how to do this yet ,COMMA but ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's something being actively thought about .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that leads to questions like ,COMMA is this a compiler ?QUESTIONMARK Is this a sub-routine ?QUESTIONMARK 
Interesting things like that .PERIOD 
Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract ,COMMA but you know ,COMMA this is the sort of -DASH -DASH returning to our comic characters -DASH -DASH this is sort of the universe ,COMMA or a different universe view ,COMMA that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -DASH -DASH from biotech to materials assembly .PERIOD It was great to hear Bill Joy .PERIOD 
They're starting to invest in materials science ,COMMA but these are the new things in materials science .PERIOD 
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas ,COMMA and see the world in a different way ?QUESTIONMARK And it's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -DASH -DASH it's sort of an analog computer .PERIOD 
But it's definitely an interesting new worldview .PERIOD 
I've gone too far .PERIOD So that sounds like it's it .PERIOD 
I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions ,COMMA or I can show -DASH -DASH I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction ,COMMA so I may have to explain that .PERIOD 
So maybe I'll do that with this short video .PERIOD 
So this is actually a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-square-foot kite ,COMMA which also happens to be a minimal energy surface .PERIOD 
So returning to the droplet ,COMMA again ,COMMA thinking about the universe in a new way .PERIOD 
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp .PERIOD 
And why do you want a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-square-foot kite ?QUESTIONMARK 
So that's a kite the size of your house .PERIOD 
And so you want that to tow boats very fast .PERIOD 
So I've been working on this a little ,COMMA also ,COMMA with a couple of other guys .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this is another way to look at the -DASH -DASH if you abstract again ,COMMA this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe .PERIOD 
You could just hang it as a bed sheet ,COMMA but again ,COMMA the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape .PERIOD 
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that .PERIOD So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future .PERIOD 
Climate change is already a heavy topic ,COMMA and it's getting heavier because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are .PERIOD 
We're understanding ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions .PERIOD 
That's ,COMMA to put it mildly ,COMMA not what's on the table now .PERIOD 
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face .PERIOD 
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us ,COMMA we tend to seek simple answers .PERIOD 
And I think this is what we've done with climate change .PERIOD 
We look at where the emissions are coming from -DASH -DASH they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth ,COMMA and we say ,COMMA okay ,COMMA well the problem is that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning ,COMMA so therefore ,COMMA the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy .PERIOD 
And while ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we do need clean energy ,COMMA I would put to you that it's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem ,COMMA we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it .PERIOD 
And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing .PERIOD 
That shouldn't be news to any of us .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .PERIOD 
By mid-century ,COMMA we're going to have about eight billion -DASH -DASH perhaps more -DASH -DASH people living in cities or within a day's travel of one .PERIOD 
In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today ,COMMA we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy .PERIOD 
It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy .PERIOD 
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet ,COMMA we need to look somewhere else for the solution .PERIOD 
The solution ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA may be closer to hand than we think ,COMMA because all of those cities we're building are opportunities .PERIOD 
Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants .PERIOD 
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing -DASH -DASH I choose to turn this light switch on -DASH -DASH but really ,COMMA enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in .PERIOD 
I won't show you very many graphs today ,COMMA but if I can just focus on this one for a moment ,COMMA it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -DASH -DASH which is ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA that if you look ,COMMA for example ,COMMA at transportation ,COMMA a major category of climate emissions ,COMMA there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA we substitute ,COMMA in our lives ,COMMA access to the things we want .PERIOD 
We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place .PERIOD 
But when we live in a denser community ,COMMA suddenly what we find ,COMMA of course ,COMMA is that the things we need are close by .PERIOD 
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place ,COMMA suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable .PERIOD 
Some places are doing this with new eco districts ,COMMA developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods ,COMMA which is nice work if you can get it ,COMMA but most of the time ,COMMA what we're talking about is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA reweaving the urban fabric that we already have .PERIOD 
So we're talking about things like infill development :COLON really sharp little changes to where we have buildings ,COMMA where we're developing .PERIOD 
Urban retrofitting :COLON creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there .PERIOD 
Increasingly ,COMMA we're realizing that we don't even need to densify an entire city .PERIOD 
What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don't drive as much and so on .PERIOD 
And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot .PERIOD 
So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city .PERIOD 
And we find that when we do that ,COMMA we can ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA have a few places that are really hyper-dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results .PERIOD 
Now we may find that there are places that are really ,COMMA really dense and still hold onto their cars ,COMMA but the reality is that ,COMMA by and large ,COMMA what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect ,COMMA where people simply stop driving as much ,COMMA and increasingly ,COMMA more and more people ,COMMA if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home ,COMMA give up their cars altogether .PERIOD 
And this is a huge ,COMMA huge energy savings ,COMMA because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars .PERIOD 
We have the manufacture of the car ,COMMA the disposal of the car ,COMMA all of the parking and freeways and so on .PERIOD 
When you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn't use any of them really ,COMMA you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
And people are embracing this .PERIOD 
All around the world ,COMMA we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life .PERIOD 
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood .PERIOD 
And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see ,COMMA what you find is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA even more access suffused into spaces .PERIOD 
Some of it's transportation access .PERIOD 
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA how far I can get from my home in <NUM> minutes using public transportation .PERIOD 
Some of it is about walking .PERIOD It's not all perfect yet .PERIOD 
This is Google Walking Maps .PERIOD 
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway ,COMMA and it told me to go via Guernsey .PERIOD 
It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths ,COMMA though .PERIOD 
But the technologies are getting better ,COMMA and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation .PERIOD 
And as we just heard earlier ,COMMA of course ,COMMA we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects .PERIOD 
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all ,COMMA we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation .PERIOD 
Part of what we're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption ,COMMA which is to get a bunch of stuff ,COMMA is not ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA how we really live best in dense environments .PERIOD 
What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things .PERIOD 
My favorite example is a drill .PERIOD Who here owns a drill ,COMMA a home power drill ?QUESTIONMARK 
Okay .PERIOD I do too .PERIOD 
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and <NUM> minutes in its entire lifetime ,COMMA depending on who you ask .PERIOD 
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time ,COMMA use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .PERIOD 
Our cities ,COMMA I would put to you ,COMMA are stockpiles of these surplus capacities .PERIOD 
And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities -DASH -DASH such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit -DASH -DASH what we probably will find is that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them ,COMMA is a far smarter way to go .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA even space itself is turning into a service .PERIOD 
We're finding that people can share the same spaces ,COMMA do stuff with vacant space .PERIOD 
Buildings are becoming bundles of services .PERIOD 
So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -DASH -DASH like heating ,COMMA cooling etc .PERIOD -DASH -DASH and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on .PERIOD 
So we light our buildings with daylight .PERIOD 
We cool them with breezes .PERIOD We heat them with sunshine .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA when we use all these things ,COMMA what we've found is that ,COMMA in some cases ,COMMA energy use in a building can drop as much as <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping ,COMMA which is ,COMMA quite simply ,COMMA if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace ,COMMA you save a whole bunch of money up front .PERIOD 
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives .PERIOD 
Now when we look at being able to slash our product use ,COMMA slash our transportation use ,COMMA slash our building energy use ,COMMA all of that is great ,COMMA but it still leaves something behind .PERIOD 
And if we're going to really ,COMMA truly become sustainable cities ,COMMA we need to think a little differently .PERIOD 
This is one way to do it .PERIOD 
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are .PERIOD 
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery .PERIOD 
So we have visions like this .PERIOD 
We have visions like this .PERIOD We have visions like this .PERIOD 
Now all of these are fine projects ,COMMA but they really have missed an essential point ,COMMA which is it's not about the leaves above ,COMMA it's about the systems below .PERIOD 
Do they ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use ?QUESTIONMARK 
Water is energy intensive .PERIOD 
Do they ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA include green infrastructure ,COMMA so that we can take runoff and water that's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by ,COMMA for example ,COMMA connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do they allow for pollination ,COMMA pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ?QUESTIONMARK 
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible ,COMMA they're being done right now ,COMMA and that it's a darn good thing .PERIOD 
And if we have another eight billion or seven billion ,COMMA or six billion ,COMMA even ,COMMA people ,COMMA living on a planet where their cities also steal the future ,COMMA we're going to run out of future really fast .PERIOD 
But if we think differently ,COMMA I think that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA we can have cities that are not only zero emissions ,COMMA but have unlimited possibilities as well .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Images like this ,COMMA from the Auschwitz concentration camp ,COMMA have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are ,COMMA where we've come from and the times we live in .PERIOD 
During the twentieth century ,COMMA we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin ,COMMA Hitler ,COMMA Mao ,COMMA Pol Pot ,COMMA Rwanda and other genocides ,COMMA and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old ,COMMA we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq .PERIOD 
This has led to a common understanding of our situation ,COMMA namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence ,COMMA and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from ,COMMA to our peril .PERIOD 
Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving ,COMMA in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago ,COMMA where the writer wrote ,COMMA The Indian life was a difficult one ,COMMA but there were no employment problems ,COMMA community harmony was strong ,COMMA substance abuse unknown ,COMMA crime nearly non-existent ,COMMA what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter .PERIOD Now ,COMMA you're all familiar with this treacle .PERIOD 
We teach it to our children .PERIOD We hear it on television and in storybooks .PERIOD Now ,COMMA the original title of this session was ,COMMA Everything You Know Is Wrong ,COMMA and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong ,COMMA that ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA our ancestors were far more violent than we are ,COMMA that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time ,COMMA and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in the decade of Darfur and Iraq ,COMMA a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene .PERIOD But I'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture .PERIOD The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon .PERIOD You can see it over millennia ,COMMA over centuries ,COMMA over decades and over years ,COMMA although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century .PERIOD One sees it all over the world ,COMMA although not homogeneously .PERIOD 
It's especially evident in the West ,COMMA beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment .PERIOD 
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of <NUM> -DASH -DASH from the millennium scale to the year scale -DASH -DASH to try to persuade you of this .PERIOD Until <NUM> years ago ,COMMA all humans lived as hunter-gatherers ,COMMA without permanent settlements or government .PERIOD And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony .PERIOD But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley ,COMMA looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter-gatherers ,COMMA which is our best source of evidence about this way of life ,COMMA has shown a rather different conclusion .PERIOD 
Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging ,COMMA or hunting and gathering societies .PERIOD 
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man ,COMMA as opposed to passing away of natural causes ,COMMA in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest .PERIOD 
And they range from a rate of almost a <NUM> percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to ,COMMA in the case of the Gebusi ,COMMA only a <NUM> percent chance .PERIOD The tiny ,COMMA little blue bar in the lower left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century ,COMMA and includes all the deaths of both World Wars .PERIOD If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century ,COMMA there would have been two billion deaths rather than <NUM> million .PERIOD 
Also at the millennium scale ,COMMA we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible .PERIOD And in this supposed source of our moral values ,COMMA one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare ,COMMA such as the following from Numbers <NUM> :COLON And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses ,COMMA and they slew all the males .PERIOD And Moses said unto them ,COMMA 'Have you saved all the women alive ?QUESTIONMARK Now ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him ,COMMA but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.' In other words ,COMMA kill the men ;SEMICOLON kill the children ;SEMICOLON if you see any virgins ,COMMA then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them .PERIOD 
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk .PERIOD 
Also in the Bible ,COMMA one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality ,COMMA adultery ,COMMA blasphemy ,COMMA idolatry ,COMMA talking back to your parents -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and picking up sticks on the Sabbath .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA let's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude ,COMMA and look at the century scale .PERIOD 
Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times ,COMMA we know just from conventional history -DASH -DASH the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment .PERIOD The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine ,COMMA in those days would result in your tongue being cut out ,COMMA your ears being cut off ,COMMA you being blinded ,COMMA a hand being chopped off and so on .PERIOD 
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment :COLON burning at the stake ,COMMA disemboweling ,COMMA breaking on the wheel ,COMMA being pulled apart by horses and so on .PERIOD 
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes :COLON criticizing the king ,COMMA stealing a loaf of bread .PERIOD Slavery ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was the preferred labor-saving device ,COMMA and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment .PERIOD Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning ,COMMA in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire ,COMMA and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat ,COMMA howling in pain ,COMMA was burned to death .PERIOD 
What about one-on-one murder ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA there ,COMMA there are good statistics ,COMMA because many municipalities recorded the cause of death .PERIOD 
The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village ,COMMA hamlet ,COMMA town ,COMMA county that he could find ,COMMA and he supplemented them with national data ,COMMA when nations started keeping statistics .PERIOD 
He plotted on a logarithmic scale ,COMMA going from <NUM> deaths per <NUM> people per year ,COMMA which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages .PERIOD And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per <NUM> people per year in seven or eight European countries .PERIOD Then ,COMMA there is a slight uptick in the 1960s .PERIOD The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that .PERIOD 
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present ,COMMA and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century .PERIOD 
Let's click down now to the decade scale .PERIOD 
According to non-governmental organizations that keep such statistics ,COMMA since <NUM> ,COMMA in Europe and the Americas ,COMMA there has been a steep decline in interstate wars ,COMMA in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms ,COMMA and in military coups ,COMMA even in South America .PERIOD Worldwide ,COMMA there's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars .PERIOD The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from <NUM> to the present .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA the death rate goes down from <NUM> deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than <NUM> deaths per conflict per year in this decade ,COMMA as horrific as it is .PERIOD 
Even in the year scale ,COMMA one can see a decline of violence .PERIOD 
Since the end of the Cold War ,COMMA there have been fewer civil wars ,COMMA fewer genocides -DASH -DASH indeed ,COMMA a <NUM> percent reduction since post-World War II highs -DASH -DASH and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime .PERIOD 
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics .PERIOD You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s ,COMMA then it soared upward for several decades ,COMMA and began a precipitous decline ,COMMA starting in the 1990s ,COMMA so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in <NUM> .PERIOD 
So the question is ,COMMA why are so many people so wrong about something so important ?QUESTIONMARK I think there are a number of reasons .PERIOD 
One of them is we have better reporting .PERIOD The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth-century monks were .PERIOD 
There's a cognitive illusion .PERIOD We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something ,COMMA the higher the probability that you assign to it .PERIOD 
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age .PERIOD There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets :COLON no one ever attracted observers ,COMMA advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better .PERIOD 
There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life ,COMMA and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior .PERIOD One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time .PERIOD 
That's a process that seems to be continuing ,COMMA but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day ,COMMA things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards .PERIOD So today ,COMMA we get exercised -DASH -DASH and rightly so -DASH -DASH if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a 15-year appeal process .PERIOD We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago ,COMMA they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted <NUM> minutes ,COMMA and indeed ,COMMA that that would have been repeated over and over again .PERIOD Today ,COMMA we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink ,COMMA rather than how high our standards have risen .PERIOD 
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA each one of them is thinking ,COMMA I don't really want to kill that guy ,COMMA but he's about to kill me .PERIOD 
Maybe I had better shoot him ,COMMA before he shoots me ,COMMA especially since ,COMMA even if he doesn't want to kill me ,COMMA he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me .PERIOD And so on .PERIOD 
Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought ,COMMA and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence .PERIOD 
You don't strike first ,COMMA but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded .PERIOD 
The only thing is that it's liable to having its bluff called ,COMMA and therefore can only work if it's credible .PERIOD To make it credible ,COMMA you must avenge all insults and settle all scores ,COMMA which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta .PERIOD 
Life becomes an episode of The Sopranos .PERIOD Hobbes' solution ,COMMA the Leviathan ,COMMA was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -DASH -DASH a leviathan -DASH -DASH then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack ,COMMA because any kind of aggression will be punished ,COMMA leaving its profitability as zero .PERIOD That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively ,COMMA out of fear of them attacking you first .PERIOD 
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory .PERIOD 
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy ,COMMA in failed states ,COMMA collapsed empires ,COMMA frontier regions ,COMMA mafias ,COMMA street gangs and so on .PERIOD 
The second explanation is that in many times and places ,COMMA there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap .PERIOD 
In earlier times ,COMMA when suffering and early death were common in one's own life ,COMMA one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others .PERIOD And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant ,COMMA one puts a higher value on life in general .PERIOD 
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game ,COMMA and was worked out in the book Nonzero by the journalist Robert Wright .PERIOD Wright points out that in certain circumstances ,COMMA cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties in an interaction ,COMMA such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead ,COMMA or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time .PERIOD 
Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in ,COMMA by allowing the trade of goods ,COMMA services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people .PERIOD 
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead ,COMMA and violence declines for selfish reasons .PERIOD As Wright put it ,COMMA Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini-van .PERIOD 
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called The Expanding Circle ,COMMA by the philosopher Peter Singer ,COMMA who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy ,COMMA an ability to treat other peoples' interests as comparable to one's own .PERIOD Unfortunately ,COMMA by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family .PERIOD 
People outside that circle are treated as sub-human ,COMMA and can be exploited with impunity .PERIOD But ,COMMA over history ,COMMA the circle has expanded .PERIOD One can see ,COMMA in historical record ,COMMA it expanding from the village ,COMMA to the clan ,COMMA to the tribe ,COMMA to the nation ,COMMA to other races ,COMMA to both sexes ,COMMA and ,COMMA in Singer's own arguments ,COMMA something that we should extend to other sentient species .PERIOD The question is ,COMMA if this has happened ,COMMA what has powered that expansion ?QUESTIONMARK 
And there are a number of possibilities ,COMMA such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for .PERIOD 
The logic of the golden rule -DASH -DASH the more you think about and interact with other people ,COMMA the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs ,COMMA at least not if you want them to listen to you .PERIOD You can't say that my interests are special compared to yours ,COMMA anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute .PERIOD 
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism ,COMMA by histories ,COMMA and journalism ,COMMA and memoirs ,COMMA and realistic fiction ,COMMA and travel ,COMMA and literacy ,COMMA which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human ,COMMA and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life ,COMMA the sense that there but for fortune go I .PERIOD 
Whatever its causes ,COMMA the decline of violence ,COMMA I think ,COMMA has profound implications .PERIOD It should force us to ask not just ,COMMA why is there war ?QUESTIONMARK But also ,COMMA why is there peace ?QUESTIONMARK Not just ,COMMA what are we doing wrong ?QUESTIONMARK But also ,COMMA what have we been doing right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON I loved that talk .PERIOD I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -DASH -DASH that you were talking about ,COMMA that Peter Singer talks about ,COMMA is also driven by ,COMMA just by technology ,COMMA by greater visibility of the other ,COMMA and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA is that also a grain of truth ?QUESTIONMARK 
Steven Pinker :COLON Very much .PERIOD It would fit both in Wright's theory ,COMMA that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles .PERIOD But also ,COMMA I think it helps us imagine what it's like to be someone else .PERIOD I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages ,COMMA you think ,COMMA how could they possibly have done it ,COMMA how could they have not have empathized with the person that they're disemboweling ?QUESTIONMARK But clearly ,COMMA as far as they're concerned ,COMMA this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own .PERIOD Anything ,COMMA I think ,COMMA that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA Steve ,COMMA I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year .PERIOD I think it's really important .PERIOD Thank you so much .PERIOD 
My pleasure .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about your mindset .PERIOD 
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset ?QUESTIONMARK

And I like that definition ,COMMA because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset .PERIOD 
And here you have the dataset .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family .PERIOD One ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five children per woman on this axis .PERIOD 
And here ,COMMA length of life ,COMMA life expectancy ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world .PERIOD 
And really this is about the bedroom .PERIOD 
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family ,COMMA and take care of their kids ,COMMA and how long they will live .PERIOD 
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen .PERIOD If you have soap ,COMMA water and food ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you can live long .PERIOD 
And the students were right .PERIOD It wasn't that the world consisted -DASH -DASH the world consisted here ,COMMA of one set of countries over here ,COMMA which had large families and short life .PERIOD Developing world .PERIOD 
And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world .PERIOD 
They had small families and long life .PERIOD 
And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime .PERIOD 
Then the developing countries applied soap and water ,COMMA vaccination .PERIOD 
And all the developing world started to apply family planning .PERIOD 
And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment .PERIOD 
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family ,COMMA and a life with <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
But some countries remain back in this area here .PERIOD 
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here .PERIOD 
So we have countries living there .PERIOD 
So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born .PERIOD 
And we ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA when we have played this over the world .PERIOD 
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week ,COMMA and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had ,COMMA that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there ,COMMA and China ,COMMA in relation to United States .PERIOD 
Look here when I move them forward .PERIOD 
Here we go .PERIOD 
They catch up .PERIOD There's Mexico .PERIOD 
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions .PERIOD 
There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this .PERIOD 
This great nation ,COMMA Mexico ,COMMA has the problem that arms are coming from North ,COMMA across the borders ,COMMA so they had to stop that ,COMMA because they have this strange relationship to the United States ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
But if I would change this axis here ,COMMA I would instead put income per person .PERIOD 
And we will then see a completely different picture .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA I'm teaching you how to use our website ,COMMA Gapminder World ,COMMA while I'm correcting this ,COMMA because this is a free utility on the net .PERIOD 
And when I now finally got it right ,COMMA I can go back <NUM> years in history .PERIOD 
And I can find United States up there .PERIOD 
And I can let the other countries be shown .PERIOD 
And now I have income per person on this axis .PERIOD 
And United States only had some ,COMMA one ,COMMA two thousand dollars at that time .PERIOD 
And the life expectancy was <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA on par with Afghanistan today .PERIOD 
And what has happened in the world ,COMMA I will show now .PERIOD 
This is instead of studying history for one year at university .PERIOD 
You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing .PERIOD 
You can see how the brown bubbles ,COMMA which is west Europe ,COMMA and the yellow one ,COMMA which is the United States ,COMMA they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier .PERIOD 
And this is now <NUM> years ago ,COMMA where the rest of the world remains behind .PERIOD 
Here we come .PERIOD And that was the influenza .PERIOD 
It's still remembered .PERIOD The fall of life expectancy .PERIOD 
And then we come up .PERIOD Not until independence started .PERIOD 
Look here You have China over there ,COMMA you have India over there ,COMMA and this is what has happened .PERIOD 
Did you note there ,COMMA that we have Mexico up there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States ,COMMA but they are quite close .PERIOD 
Because in fact ,COMMA this is child labor .PERIOD My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this .PERIOD 
And my youngest son ,COMMA who studied Chinese in Beijing .PERIOD 
So they come in with the two perspectives I have ,COMMA you know ?QUESTIONMARK 
And my son ,COMMA youngest son who studied in Beijing ,COMMA in China ,COMMA he got a long-term perspective .PERIOD 
Whereas when my oldest son ,COMMA who works for Google ,COMMA he should develop by quarter ,COMMA or by half-year .PERIOD 
Or Google is quite generous ,COMMA so he can have one or two years to go .PERIOD 
But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period ,COMMA for <NUM> years ,COMMA when they went backwards .PERIOD 
And then they would remember the first part of last century ,COMMA which was really bad ,COMMA and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward .PERIOD 
But this was <NUM> .PERIOD 
Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy ,COMMA and then gradually got rich ?QUESTIONMARK 
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier ,COMMA because they applied the knowledge of education ,COMMA nutrition ,COMMA and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning .PERIOD 
And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development .PERIOD 
So to me ,COMMA as a public health professor ,COMMA it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now .PERIOD 
Because what you see here ,COMMA what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman ,COMMA isn't it .PERIOD 
It's not really ,COMMA really flat .PERIOD 
But the middle income countries -DASH -DASH and this is where I suggest to my students ,COMMA stop using the concept developing world .PERIOD 
Because after all ,COMMA talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States .PERIOD 
The last chapter is about present ,COMMA and president Obama ,COMMA and the other is about the past ,COMMA where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower .PERIOD 
Because Washington to Eisenhower ,COMMA that is what we find in the developing world .PERIOD 
We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower ,COMMA and that would be put together into a developing world ,COMMA which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way ,COMMA which have great entrepreneurs ,COMMA but also have the collapsing countries .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA how could we make better sense about this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution .PERIOD 
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world ,COMMA from $1 .PERIOD This is where you have food to eat .PERIOD 
These people go to bed hungry .PERIOD 
And this is the number of people .PERIOD 
This is $10 ,COMMA whether you have a public or a private health service system .PERIOD This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children ,COMMA and this is OECD countries :COLON Green ,COMMA Latin America ,COMMA East Europe .PERIOD 
This is East Asia ,COMMA and the light blue there is South Asia .PERIOD 
And this is how the world changed .PERIOD 
It changed like this .PERIOD 
Can you see how it's growing ?QUESTIONMARK And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it goes over here ?QUESTIONMARK 
Probably the world will do this .PERIOD 
and then it will continue forward like this .PERIOD 
But more or less ,COMMA this is what will happen ,COMMA and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided .PERIOD 
We have the high income countries here ,COMMA with the United States as a leading power ;SEMICOLON we have the emerging economies in the middle ,COMMA which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ;SEMICOLON and we have the low income countries here .PERIOD 
Yeah ,COMMA this is a fact that from where the money comes ,COMMA they have been saving ,COMMA you know ,COMMA over the last decade .PERIOD 
And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are .PERIOD 
And here we have the countries in collapse and war ,COMMA like Afghanistan ,COMMA Somalia ,COMMA parts of Congo ,COMMA Darfur .PERIOD 
We have all this at the same time .PERIOD 
That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world .PERIOD 
Because it's so different ,COMMA what has happened there .PERIOD 
And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it .PERIOD 
And you have huge differences within countries also .PERIOD 
I heard that your departments here were by regions .PERIOD 
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa ,COMMA South Asia ,COMMA East Asia ,COMMA Arab states ,COMMA East Europe ,COMMA Latin America ,COMMA and OECD .PERIOD 
And on this axis ,COMMA GDP .PERIOD 
And on this ,COMMA heath ,COMMA child survival ,COMMA and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom .PERIOD 
But when I split it ,COMMA when I split it into country bubbles ,COMMA the size of the bubbles here is the population .PERIOD 
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius ,COMMA completely different .PERIOD 
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa .PERIOD 
And I can split the others .PERIOD Here is the South Asian ,COMMA Arab world .PERIOD 
Now all your different departments .PERIOD 
And here were are .PERIOD We have a continuum in the world .PERIOD 
We cannot put it into two parts .PERIOD 
It is Mayflower down here .PERIOD It is Washington here ,COMMA building ,COMMA building countries .PERIOD 
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries .PERIOD 
And then it's United States today ,COMMA up here .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed .PERIOD 
At this point I decided to make a pause .PERIOD 
And it is my task ,COMMA on behalf of the rest of the world ,COMMA to convey a thanks to the U.S .PERIOD taxpayers ,COMMA for Demographic Health Survey .PERIOD 
Many are not aware of -DASH -DASH no ,COMMA this is not a joke .PERIOD 
This is very serious .PERIOD 
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during <NUM> years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world .PERIOD 
And it is U.S .PERIOD government at its best ,COMMA without advocacy ,COMMA providing facts ,COMMA that it's useful for the society .PERIOD 
And providing data free of charge on the internet ,COMMA for the world to use .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Quite the opposite of the World Bank ,COMMA who compiled data with government money ,COMMA tax money ,COMMA and then they sell it to add a little profit ,COMMA in a very inefficient ,COMMA Gutenberg way .PERIOD 
But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world .PERIOD 
And they are highly skilled professionals .PERIOD 
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way ,COMMA as we do .PERIOD 
And when it comes to free data and transparency ,COMMA United States of America is one of the best .PERIOD 
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor .PERIOD 
And I'm not paid to come here ,COMMA no .PERIOD 
I would like to show you what happens with the data ,COMMA what we can show with this data .PERIOD 
Look here .PERIOD This is the world .PERIOD 
With income down there and child mortality .PERIOD 
Since <NUM> ,COMMA during the last <NUM> years we have had a fall in child mortality .PERIOD 
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this .PERIOD 
And we had an increase in income .PERIOD 
And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .PERIOD 
We have a continuum .PERIOD But we still have ,COMMA of course ,COMMA Congo ,COMMA up there .PERIOD We still have as poor countries as we have had ,COMMA always ,COMMA in history .PERIOD 
And that's the bottom billion ,COMMA where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it .PERIOD 
And how fast has this happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA MDG <NUM> .PERIOD 
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG <NUM> .PERIOD 
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it ,COMMA because it's the only child mortality that we can measure .PERIOD 
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year .PERIOD 
Let's see what Sweden has done .PERIOD 
<NUM> ,COMMA Sweden was there .PERIOD 
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA though they had lower income .PERIOD 
They started very well .PERIOD They used the aid well .PERIOD 
They vaccinated the kids .PERIOD They get better water .PERIOD 
And they reduced child mortality ,COMMA with an amazing <NUM> percent per year .PERIOD They beat Sweden .PERIOD 
I run Sweden the same <NUM> year period .PERIOD 
Second round ,COMMA it's Sweden ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA against Egypt ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Here we go .PERIOD Once again the USA is part of the reason here .PERIOD 
They get safe water ,COMMA they get food for the poor ,COMMA and they get malaria eradicated .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent .PERIOD They are faster than the millennium development goal .PERIOD 
And third chance for Sweden ,COMMA against Brazil here .PERIOD 
Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA and they go faster than Sweden .PERIOD 
This means that the world is converging .PERIOD 
The middle income countries ,COMMA the emerging economy ,COMMA they are catching up .PERIOD 
They are moving to cities ,COMMA where they also get better assistance for that .PERIOD 
Well the Swedish students protest at this point .PERIOD 
They say ,COMMA This is not fair ,COMMA because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden .PERIOD 
We have to do real-time competition .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD I give you Singapore ,COMMA the year I was born .PERIOD 
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden .PERIOD 
It's the most tropical country in the world ,COMMA a marshland on the equator .PERIOD 
And here we go .PERIOD It took a little time for them to get independent .PERIOD 
But then they started to grow their economy .PERIOD 
And they made the social investment .PERIOD They got away malaria .PERIOD 
They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S .PERIOD and Sweden .PERIOD 
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals .PERIOD 
These yellow are just about to be doing this .PERIOD 
These red are the countries that doesn't do it ,COMMA and the policy has to be improved .PERIOD 
Not simplistic extrapolation .PERIOD 
We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way .PERIOD 
We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing .PERIOD 
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world .PERIOD 
This is dollar per person .PERIOD This is HIV in the countries .PERIOD 
The blue is Africa .PERIOD 
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected .PERIOD 
You see the tragedy in South Africa there .PERIOD 
About <NUM> percent of the adult population are infected .PERIOD 
And in spite of them having quite a high income ,COMMA they have a huge number of HIV infected .PERIOD 
But you also see that there are African countries down here .PERIOD 
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa .PERIOD 
There's a number ,COMMA five to <NUM> countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States .PERIOD 
And there are others who are extremely high .PERIOD 
And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries ,COMMA with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance ,COMMA Botswana .PERIOD 
They have a very high level .PERIOD It's coming down .PERIOD 
But now it's not falling ,COMMA because there ,COMMA with help from PEPFAR ,COMMA it's working with treatment .PERIOD And people are not dying .PERIOD 
Because here ,COMMA in Congo ,COMMA there is war .PERIOD 
And it's not the economy .PERIOD Richer country has a little higher .PERIOD 
Look at the provinces of Kenya .PERIOD They are very different .PERIOD 
And this is the situation you see .PERIOD 
It's not deep poverty .PERIOD It's the special situation ,COMMA probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries ,COMMA or some parts of countries ,COMMA in south and eastern Africa .PERIOD 
Don't make it Africa .PERIOD Don't make it a race issue .PERIOD 
Make it a local issue .PERIOD And do prevention at each place ,COMMA in the way it can be done there .PERIOD 
So to just end up ,COMMA there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest ,COMMA which we don't know .PERIOD 
Those who live beyond the cellphone ,COMMA those who have yet to see a computer ,COMMA those who have no electricity at home .PERIOD 
This is the disease ,COMMA Konzo ,COMMA I spent <NUM> years elucidating in Africa .PERIOD 
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation .PERIOD 
It's similar to other nutritional diseases .PERIOD 
It will never affect a rich person .PERIOD 
This is the epidemic in Mozambique .PERIOD This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania .PERIOD 
You never heard about the disease .PERIOD 
But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease .PERIOD 
Cause crippling throughout the world .PERIOD 
And over the last two years ,COMMA <NUM> people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region .PERIOD 
That has now disappeared ,COMMA and they are now in great economic problem .PERIOD 
And one week ago ,COMMA for the first time ,COMMA there were four lines on the Internet .PERIOD 
There is still mystery in one billion .PERIOD 
And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world .PERIOD 
We need a new mindset .PERIOD The world is converging ,COMMA but -DASH -DASH but -DASH -DASH but not the bottom billion .PERIOD 
They are still as poor as they've ever been .PERIOD 
It's not sustainable ,COMMA and it will not happen around one superpower .PERIOD 
But you will remain one of the most important superpowers ,COMMA and the most hopeful superpower ,COMMA for the time to be .PERIOD 
And this institution will have a very crucial role ,COMMA not for United States ,COMMA but for the world .PERIOD 
So you have a very bad name ,COMMA State Department .PERIOD This is not the State Department .PERIOD 
It's the World Department .PERIOD 
And we have a high hope in you .PERIOD Thank you very much .PERIOD 
In October ,COMMA I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo ,COMMA which is the [second] largest country in Africa .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it's as large as Western Europe ,COMMA but it only has <NUM> miles of paved roads .PERIOD 
The DRC is a dangerous place .PERIOD 
In the past <NUM> years ,COMMA five million people have died due to a war in the east .PERIOD 
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .PERIOD 
There are many health issues as well .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA the HIV prevalence rate is <NUM> percent among adults .PERIOD 
This might not sound like a large number ,COMMA but in a country with <NUM> million people ,COMMA it means there are <NUM> that are infected .PERIOD 
And due to the poor infrastructure ,COMMA only <NUM> percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .PERIOD 
Which is why ,COMMA in part ,COMMA donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .PERIOD 
And so while I was in the DRC ,COMMA I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms ,COMMA including Damien .PERIOD 
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .PERIOD 
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight ,COMMA so it's not a place that you stay .PERIOD 
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .PERIOD 
Now Damien knows all about condoms ,COMMA but he doesn't sell them .PERIOD 
It's not surprising ,COMMA because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms .PERIOD 
Joseph and Christine ,COMMA who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms ,COMMA said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost ,COMMA and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them ,COMMA their customers don't buy the branded versions .PERIOD 
They like the generics .PERIOD 
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .PERIOD 
They name the condoms things like Vive ,COMMA to live or Trust .PERIOD 
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .PERIOD 
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?QUESTIONMARK 
Sex !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places ,COMMA they understand this .PERIOD 
Their marketing is slightly different .PERIOD 
The name might not be much different ,COMMA but the imagery sure is .PERIOD 
Some brands are aspirational ,COMMA and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .PERIOD 
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing :COLON understanding who's the audience .PERIOD 
And for donor agencies ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in] .PERIOD 
It's people back home ,COMMA people that support their work ,COMMA people like these .PERIOD 
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV ,COMMA we need to think about the customer ,COMMA the people whose behavior needs to change -DASH -DASH the couples ,COMMA the young women ,COMMA the young men -DASH -DASH whose lives depend on it .PERIOD 
It might just save their lives .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I've got apparently <NUM> minutes to convince you that history has a direction ,COMMA an arrow ;SEMICOLON that in some fundamental sense ,COMMA it's good ;SEMICOLON that the arrow points to something positive .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting .PERIOD 
It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election ,COMMA eliciting various counter-measures by Israel .PERIOD 
And to be honest ,COMMA if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk ,COMMA the apocalypse would be unfolding -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH I might have said ,COMMA Is it okay if I talk about something else ?QUESTIONMARK 
But I didn't ,COMMA OK .PERIOD So we're here .PERIOD I'll do what I can .PERIOD I'll do what I can .PERIOD 
I've got to warn you :COLON the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle ,COMMA sometimes even elusive .PERIOD 
The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift ,COMMA so if grim inspiration -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms ,COMMA that is ,COMMA I'm afraid ,COMMA the most you can hope for .PERIOD OK ,COMMA today -DASH -DASH that's if I succeed .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA in one sense ,COMMA the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial .PERIOD 
If you're just talking about social structure ,COMMA OK ,COMMA clearly that's gotten more complex a little over the last <NUM> years -DASH -DASH has reached higher and higher levels .PERIOD 
And in fact ,COMMA that's actually sustaining a long-standing trend that predates human beings ,COMMA OK ,COMMA that biological evolution was doing for us .PERIOD 
Because what happened in the beginning ,COMMA this stuff encases itself in a cell ,COMMA then cells start hanging out together in societies .PERIOD 
Eventually they get so close ,COMMA they form multicellular organisms ,COMMA then you get complex multicellular organisms ;SEMICOLON they form societies .PERIOD 
But then at some point ,COMMA one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff ,COMMA which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution :COLON cultural evolution .PERIOD 
And amazingly ,COMMA that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity .PERIOD 
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas .PERIOD 
A lot of you have heard the term memes .PERIOD The evolution of technology ,COMMA I pay a lot of attention to ,COMMA so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .PERIOD 
Next best thing to a video game .PERIOD 
This may not seem to impress ,COMMA but technological evolution is progressive ,COMMA so another <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA and armaments technology takes you here .PERIOD 
Impressive .PERIOD And the rate of technological evolution speeds up ,COMMA so a mere quarter of a century after this ,COMMA you get this ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
And this .PERIOD 
I'm sorry -DASH -DASH it was a cheap laugh ,COMMA but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse ,COMMA and I thought that might do it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are ,COMMA to be on the brink of true global social organization .PERIOD 
Originally ,COMMA you had the most complex societies ,COMMA the hunter-gatherer village .PERIOD 
Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom ,COMMA which is what you get with the invention of agriculture :COLON multi-village polity with centralized rule .PERIOD 
With the invention of writing ,COMMA you start getting cities .PERIOD This is blurry .PERIOD I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point .PERIOD And then you get to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you get empires .PERIOD 
I want to stress ,COMMA you know ,COMMA social organization can transcend political bounds .PERIOD 
This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire .PERIOD 
So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent ,COMMA even if no polity did similarly .PERIOD Today ,COMMA you've got nation states .PERIOD 
This is actually just a picture of the earth at night ,COMMA and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty .PERIOD 
Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called non-zero sumness .PERIOD 
Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading ,COMMA very quickly ,COMMA the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games ,COMMA in which correlations are inverse :COLON always a winner and a loser .PERIOD 
Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
So like in tennis ,COMMA usually it's win-lose ;SEMICOLON it always adds up to zero-zero-sum .PERIOD But if you're playing doubles ,COMMA the person on your side of the net ,COMMA they're in the same boat as you ,COMMA so you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them .PERIOD 
It's either for the better or for the worse ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
The argument I make is basically that ,COMMA well ,COMMA non-zero-sum games have always been part of life .PERIOD 
You have them in hunter-gatherer societies ,COMMA but then through technological evolution ,COMMA new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games ,COMMA involving more people over larger territory .PERIOD 
Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential ,COMMA so you get cities ,COMMA you know ,COMMA and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about that are being played across the world .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA have you ever thought when you buy a car ,COMMA how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car ?QUESTIONMARK Those are people in effect you're playing a non-zero-sum game with .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA there are certainly plenty of them around .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA it can accommodate ;SEMICOLON it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war .PERIOD 
But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat ,COMMA because a non-zero-sum game ,COMMA all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse .PERIOD 
It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA the question is :COLON on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history ?QUESTIONMARK And the answer is ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA on balance I would say people have played their games to more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes .PERIOD On balance ,COMMA I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department .PERIOD 
And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me ,COMMA most impresses me ,COMMA and most uplifts me ,COMMA which is that there is a moral dimension to history ;SEMICOLON there is a moral arrow .PERIOD We have seen moral progress over time .PERIOD 
<NUM> years ago ,COMMA members of one Greek city-state considered members of another Greek city-state subhuman and treated them that way .PERIOD And then this moral revolution arrived ,COMMA and they decided that actually ,COMMA no ,COMMA Greeks are human beings .PERIOD 
It's just the Persians who aren't fully human and don't deserve to be treated very nicely .PERIOD 
But this was progress -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA give them credit .PERIOD And now today ,COMMA we've seen more progress .PERIOD I think -DASH -DASH I hope -DASH -DASH most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings ,COMMA deserve to be treated decently ,COMMA unless they do something horrendous ,COMMA regardless of race or religion .PERIOD 
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been ,COMMA OK .PERIOD This was not a prevalent view ,COMMA few thousand years ago ,COMMA and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic .PERIOD 
I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities ,COMMA ethnicities ,COMMA religions as there is today .PERIOD If you asked me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA why am I not in favor of bombing Japan ,COMMA well ,COMMA I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car .PERIOD 
We have this non-zero-sum relationship ,COMMA and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours -DASH -DASH you're more likely to cut them a break .PERIOD 
I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough to know ,COMMA or any other kind of business class really ,COMMA but I assume that in business class ,COMMA you don't hear many expressions of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups ,COMMA because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ;SEMICOLON they're making money off all these people .PERIOD And I really do think that ,COMMA in that sense at least ,COMMA capitalism has been a constructive force ,COMMA and more fundamentally ,COMMA it's a non-zero-sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm of moral awareness .PERIOD I think the non-zero-sum dynamic ,COMMA which is not only economic by any means -DASH -DASH it's not always commerce -DASH -DASH but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth ,COMMA which is the fundamental equality of everyone .PERIOD It has done that .PERIOD 
As it has moved global ,COMMA moved us toward a global level of social organization ,COMMA it has driven us toward moral truth .PERIOD 
I think that's wonderful .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA back to the unfolding apocalypse .PERIOD 
And you may wonder ,COMMA OK ,COMMA that's all fine ,COMMA sounds great -DASH -DASH moral direction in history -DASH -DASH but what about this so-called clash of civilizations ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework ,COMMA OK .PERIOD If you look at the relationship between the so-called Muslim world and Western world -DASH -DASH two terms I don't like ,COMMA but can't really avoid ;SEMICOLON in such a short span of time ,COMMA they're efficient if nothing else -DASH -DASH it is non-zero-sum .PERIOD And by that I mean ,COMMA if people in the Muslim world get more hateful ,COMMA more resentful ,COMMA less happy with their place in the world ,COMMA it'll be bad for the West .PERIOD If they get more happy ,COMMA it'll be good for the West .PERIOD 
So that is a non-zero-sum dynamic .PERIOD 
And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends ,COMMA but more intense in a kind of negative way .PERIOD 
It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible .PERIOD 
And one reason is because of something I call the growing lethality of hatred .PERIOD 
More and more ,COMMA it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil .PERIOD 
And that's pretty new ,COMMA and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse -DASH -DASH this capacity -DASH -DASH because of trends in information technology ,COMMA in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology .PERIOD 
We may be hearing more about that today .PERIOD 
And there's something I worry about especially ,COMMA which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope .PERIOD 
What I have in mind is :COLON terrorism happens here ;SEMICOLON we overreact to it .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad ,COMMA more terrorism .PERIOD 
We overreact because being human ,COMMA we feel like retaliating ,COMMA and it gets worse and worse and worse .PERIOD 
You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes ,COMMA but I think in something so spooky ,COMMA we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all ,COMMA even in a technical sense .PERIOD 
So let's call it the death spiral of negativity .PERIOD 
I assure you if it happens ,COMMA at the end ,COMMA both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what do we do ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA first of all ,COMMA we can do a lot more with arms control ,COMMA the international regulation of dangerous technologies .PERIOD 
I think we're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .PERIOD 
I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups ,COMMA less bigotry ,COMMA and ,COMMA you know ,COMMA racial groups ,COMMA religious groups ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD 
I've got to admit I feel silly saying that .PERIOD 
It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish .PERIOD I feel like Rodney King ,COMMA you know ,COMMA saying ,COMMA why can't we all just get along ?QUESTIONMARK 
But hey ,COMMA I don't really see any alternative ,COMMA given the way I read the situation .PERIOD 
There's going to have to be moral progress .PERIOD 
There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world ,COMMA given how dangerous it's becoming .PERIOD 
In my defense ,COMMA I'd say ,COMMA as naive as this may sound ,COMMA it's ultimately grounded in cynicism .PERIOD 
It's when people's fortunes are correlated .PERIOD 
It's when your welfare conduces to mine ,COMMA that I decide ,COMMA oh yeah ,COMMA I'm all in favor of your welfare .PERIOD That's what's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far ,COMMA and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes ,COMMA and if people respond to it intelligently ,COMMA we will see the development of tolerance and so on -DASH -DASH the norms that we need ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these two things ,COMMA you know ,COMMA if they get people's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests ,COMMA which is further the moral evolution ,COMMA then they could actually have a constructive effect .PERIOD 
And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric ,COMMA reasons to be cheerful .PERIOD 
I never called myself Mr .PERIOD Uplift .PERIOD 
I'm just doing what I can here .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA launching a moral revolution has got to be hard ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA what do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things .PERIOD 
We all start where we are .PERIOD Speaking as an American who has children whose security <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years down the road I worry about -DASH -DASH what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us ,COMMA OK .PERIOD 
I think that's a worthy research project myself .PERIOD 
I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise .PERIOD 
Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something -DASH -DASH somebody you're kind of viewing as alien ,COMMA who's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange -DASH -DASH to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment ,COMMA because you've got to relate their experience to yours .PERIOD 
To really understand it ,COMMA you've got to say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA I get it .PERIOD 
So when they feel resentful ,COMMA it's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens ,COMMA and for somewhat the same reasons .PERIOD That's true understanding .PERIOD 
And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that .PERIOD 
It's especially hard to do when people hate you ,COMMA OK ,COMMA because you don't really ,COMMA in a sense ,COMMA want to completely understand why people hate you .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA you want to hear the reason ,COMMA but you don't want to be able to relate to it .PERIOD 
You don't want it to make sense ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
You don't want to say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in .PERIOD That's not a pleasant thing ,COMMA but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and work on .PERIOD Now ,COMMA I want to stress that to understand ,COMMA you know -DASH -DASH there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots ,COMMA the root causes of things ;SEMICOLON they don't want to know why people hate us .PERIOD I want to understand it .PERIOD 
The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us ,COMMA is to get them to quit hating us .PERIOD The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them ,COMMA is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run .PERIOD 
I think it's the first step toward that .PERIOD That's the long-term goal .PERIOD 
There are people who worry about this ,COMMA and in fact ,COMMA I ,COMMA myself ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA if you've got to have an enemy ,COMMA do make it Ann Coulter .PERIOD 
But it's not a crazy concern ,COMMA OK ,COMMA because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy ,COMMA and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough ,COMMA than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't ,COMMA you know ,COMMA get the army out to kill terrorists .PERIOD 
So I'm not really worried about it .PERIOD So -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH I mean ,COMMA we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts ,COMMA but if we succeed -DASH -DASH if we succeed -DASH -DASH then once again ,COMMA non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level .PERIOD 
If you look at the word salvation in the Bible -DASH -DASH the Christian usage that we're familiar with -DASH -DASH saving souls ,COMMA that people go to heaven -DASH -DASH that's actually a latecomer .PERIOD 
The original meaning of the word salvation in the Bible is about saving the social system .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA social organization has reached the global level ,COMMA and I guess ,COMMA if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you ,COMMA it's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way .PERIOD 
It's going to be hard .PERIOD I say we give it a shot anyway because we've just come too far to screw it up now .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
I am very happy and honored to be amidst very ,COMMA very innovative and intelligent people .PERIOD 
I have listened to the three previous speakers ,COMMA and guess what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
Every single thing I planned to say ,COMMA they have said it here ,COMMA and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say .PERIOD 
But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something ,COMMA that bud is a young one .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I will -DASH -DASH since I am not young and am very old ,COMMA I still will say something .PERIOD 
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment ,COMMA because another conference is taking place in Berlin .PERIOD 
It is the G8 Summit .PERIOD 
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems should be a massive increase in aid ,COMMA something akin to the Marshall Plan .PERIOD 
Unfortunately ,COMMA I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan .PERIOD 
One ,COMMA because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated .PERIOD 
Its largest recipients were Germany and France ,COMMA and it was only <NUM> percent of their GDP .PERIOD 
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> percent of its GDP ,COMMA and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries .PERIOD 
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect .PERIOD 
How the media covers Africa in the West ,COMMA and the consequences of that .PERIOD 
By displaying despair ,COMMA helplessness and hopelessness ,COMMA the media is telling the truth about Africa ,COMMA and nothing but the truth .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA the media is not telling us the whole truth .PERIOD 
And secondly ,COMMA they are the smallest reality .PERIOD 
Africa has <NUM> nations .PERIOD 
We have civil wars only in six countries ,COMMA which means that the media are covering only six countries .PERIOD 
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience .PERIOD 
But the effect of that presentation is ,COMMA it appeals to sympathy .PERIOD 
It appeals to pity .PERIOD It appeals to something called charity .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as a consequence ,COMMA the Western view of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly .PERIOD 
The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair .PERIOD 
What should we do with it ?QUESTIONMARK We should give food to the hungry .PERIOD 
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill .PERIOD 
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war .PERIOD 
And in the process ,COMMA Africa has been stripped of self-initiative .PERIOD 
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses .PERIOD 
But equally ,COMMA it has opportunities and a lot of potential .PERIOD 
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa ,COMMA from a challenge of despair ,COMMA which is called poverty reduction ,COMMA to a challenge of hope .PERIOD 
We frame it as a challenge of hope ,COMMA and that is worth creation .PERIOD 
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty .PERIOD 
It should be a challenge of creating wealth .PERIOD 
Once we change those two things -DASH -DASH if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction ,COMMA you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent ,COMMA with what ?QUESTIONMARK 
Medicines for the poor ,COMMA food relief for those who are hungry ,COMMA and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war .PERIOD 
And in the process ,COMMA none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms ,COMMA not the causes of Africa's fundamental problems .PERIOD 
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA does not create wealth for them .PERIOD 
Wealth is a function of income ,COMMA and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa ,COMMA our second challenge will be ,COMMA who are the wealth-creating agents in any society ?QUESTIONMARK 
They are entrepreneurs .PERIOD [Unclear] told us they are always about four percent of the population ,COMMA but <NUM> percent are imitators .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA where should we be putting the money ?QUESTIONMARK 
We need to put money where it can productively grow .PERIOD 
Support research institutions ,COMMA because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation .PERIOD 
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today ?QUESTIONMARK 
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health ,COMMA for primary education ,COMMA for food relief .PERIOD 
The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair ,COMMA in need of charity .PERIOD 
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA can any one of you tell me a neighbor ,COMMA a friend ,COMMA a relative that you know ,COMMA who became rich by receiving charity ?QUESTIONMARK 
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does any one of you in the audience have that person ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA since I'm not seeing the hand ,COMMA it appears that what I'm stating is true .PERIOD 
Andrew Mwenda :COLON I can see Bono says he knows the country .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD But let me tell you this .PERIOD 
External actors can only present to you an opportunity .PERIOD 
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity .PERIOD 
Africa has received many opportunities .PERIOD 
Many of them we haven't benefited much .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because we lack the internal ,COMMA institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations .PERIOD I'll give you an example .PERIOD 
Under the Cotonou Agreement ,COMMA formerly known as the Lome Convention ,COMMA African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods ,COMMA duty-free ,COMMA to the European Union market .PERIOD 
My own country ,COMMA Uganda ,COMMA has a quota to export <NUM> metric tons of sugar to the European Union market .PERIOD 
We haven't exported one kilogram yet .PERIOD 
We import <NUM> metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA under the beef protocol of that agreement ,COMMA African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market .PERIOD 
None of those countries ,COMMA including Africa's most successful nation ,COMMA Botswana ,COMMA has ever met its quota .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework .PERIOD 
And all forms of intervention need support ,COMMA the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth ,COMMA the kinds of institutions that increase productivity .PERIOD 
How do we begin to do that ,COMMA and why is aid the bad instrument ?QUESTIONMARK 
Aid is the bad instrument ,COMMA and do you know why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because all governments across the world need money to survive .PERIOD 
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order .PERIOD 
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .PERIOD 
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial ,COMMA they need really to have the army clobber the opposition .PERIOD 
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on .PERIOD 
Why should people support their government ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA because it gives them good ,COMMA paying jobs ,COMMA or ,COMMA in many African countries ,COMMA unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption .PERIOD 
The fact is no government in the world ,COMMA with the exception of a few ,COMMA like that of Idi Amin ,COMMA can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .PERIOD 
Many countries in the [unclear] ,COMMA they need legitimacy .PERIOD 
To get legitimacy ,COMMA governments often need to deliver things like primary education ,COMMA primary health ,COMMA roads ,COMMA build hospitals and clinics .PERIOD 
If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people ,COMMA such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion .PERIOD 
It will sit with those who create wealth .PERIOD 
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them .PERIOD 
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa .PERIOD 
Rather than sit with Ugandan -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs ,COMMA Ghanaian businessmen ,COMMA South African enterprising leaders ,COMMA our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank .PERIOD 
I can tell you ,COMMA even if you have ten Ph.Ds. ,COMMA you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -DASH -DASH it requires that you listen to the people ,COMMA the private sector actors in that industry .PERIOD 
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity ,COMMA by the international community ,COMMA to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens ,COMMA and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank ,COMMA and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need .PERIOD 
In the process ,COMMA we ,COMMA the African people ,COMMA have been sidelined from the policy-making ,COMMA policy-orientation ,COMMA and policy- implementation process in our countries .PERIOD 
We have limited input ,COMMA because he who pays the piper calls the tune .PERIOD 
But I want to put a caveat on my argument ,COMMA and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive .PERIOD 
Some aid may have built a hospital ,COMMA fed a hungry village .PERIOD 
It may have built a road ,COMMA and that road may have served a very good role .PERIOD 
The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success ,COMMA generalize them ,COMMA pour billions and trillions of dollars into them ,COMMA and then spread them across the whole world ,COMMA ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village ,COMMA the skills ,COMMA the practices ,COMMA the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -DASH -DASH like in Sauri village ,COMMA in Kenya ,COMMA where Jeffrey Sachs is working -DASH -DASH and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody .PERIOD 
Aid increases the resources available to governments ,COMMA and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have ,COMMA as a person in Africa seeking a career .PERIOD 
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state ,COMMA especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa ,COMMA aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie .PERIOD 
Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA the most enterprising people in Africa cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business .PERIOD 
Governments are not changing it .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government ,COMMA and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid .PERIOD 
I also want to say that it is important for us to note that ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community ,COMMA in the form of technical assistance ,COMMA and financial aid ,COMMA and all other forms of aid .PERIOD 
Between <NUM> and <NUM> ,COMMA our continent received <NUM> billion dollars of aid ,COMMA and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa .PERIOD 
I want to use the example of my own country ,COMMA called Uganda ,COMMA and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there .PERIOD 
In the 2006-2007 budget ,COMMA expected revenue :COLON <NUM> trillion shillings .PERIOD 
The expected foreign aid :COLON <NUM> trillion .PERIOD 
Hand-to-mouth is <NUM> trillion .PERIOD 
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend <NUM> percent of its own revenue ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid ,COMMA who contributes for it .PERIOD 
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments ,COMMA but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure .PERIOD 
Public administration ,COMMA which is largely patronage ,COMMA takes <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
The military ,COMMA <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
Agriculture ,COMMA which employs <NUM> percent of our poverty-stricken citizens ,COMMA takes only <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
Trade and industry takes <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
And let me show you ,COMMA what does public expenditure -DASH -DASH rather ,COMMA public administration expenditure -DASH -DASH in Uganda constitute ?QUESTIONMARK 
There you go .PERIOD <NUM> cabinet ministers ,COMMA <NUM> presidential advisers ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA who never see the president ,COMMA except on television .PERIOD 
And when they see him physically ,COMMA it is at public functions like this ,COMMA and even there ,COMMA it is him who advises them .PERIOD 
We have <NUM> units of local government .PERIOD 
Each local government is organized like the central government -DASH -DASH a bureaucracy ,COMMA a cabinet ,COMMA a parliament ,COMMA and so many jobs for the political hangers-on .PERIOD 
There were <NUM> ,COMMA and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits ,COMMA he had to create <NUM> new districts ,COMMA and now there are <NUM> .PERIOD 
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament .PERIOD 
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament .PERIOD 
One hundred thirty-four commissions and semi-autonomous government bodies ,COMMA all of which have directors and the cars .PERIOD And the final thing ,COMMA this is addressed to Mr .PERIOD Bono .PERIOD In his work ,COMMA he may help us on this .PERIOD 
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are <NUM> four-wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters .PERIOD 
Uganda has <NUM> sub-counties ,COMMA each of them with a dispensary ,COMMA none of which has an ambulance .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers ,COMMA the permanent secretaries ,COMMA the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects ,COMMA while the poor die without ambulances and medicine .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA I want to say that before I came to speak here ,COMMA I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt .PERIOD 
It should be short enough to arouse interest ,COMMA but long enough to cover the subject .PERIOD 
I hope I have achieved that .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
When I was president of the American Psychological Association ,COMMA they tried to media-train me ,COMMA and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today ,COMMA which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic .PERIOD 
We'd like to interview you about that .PERIOD And I said ,COMMA Great .PERIOD 
And she said ,COMMA But this is CNN ,COMMA so you only get a sound bite .PERIOD 
So I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA how many words do I get ?QUESTIONMARK 
And she said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA one .PERIOD 
And cameras rolled ,COMMA and she said ,COMMA Professor Seligman ,COMMA what is the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
Good .PERIOD 
Cut .PERIOD Cut .PERIOD That won't do .PERIOD 
We'd really better give you a longer sound bite .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA how many words do I get this time ?QUESTIONMARK I think ,COMMA well ,COMMA you get two .PERIOD 
Doctor Seligman ,COMMA what is the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not good .PERIOD 
We'd better give you a real sound bite .PERIOD 
This time you can have three words .PERIOD 
Professor Seligman ,COMMA what is the state of psychology today ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want to say why psychology was good ,COMMA why it was not good and how it may become ,COMMA in the next <NUM> years ,COMMA good enough .PERIOD 
And by parallel summary ,COMMA I want to say the same thing about technology ,COMMA about entertainment and design ,COMMA because I think the issues are very similar .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why was psychology good ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA for more than <NUM> years ,COMMA psychology worked within the disease model .PERIOD 
Ten years ago ,COMMA when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate ,COMMA and told them what I did ,COMMA they'd move away from me .PERIOD 
And because ,COMMA quite rightly ,COMMA they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you .PERIOD Spot the loony .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA when I tell people what I do ,COMMA they move toward me .PERIOD 
And what was good about psychology ,COMMA about the <NUM> billion dollar investment NIMH made ,COMMA about working in the disease model ,COMMA about what you mean by psychology ,COMMA is that ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA none of the disorders were treatable -DASH -DASH it was entirely smoke and mirrors .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA <NUM> of the disorders are treatable ,COMMA two of them actually curable .PERIOD 
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed ,COMMA a science of mental illness .PERIOD 
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -DASH -DASH like depression ,COMMA alcoholism -DASH -DASH and measure them with rigor .PERIOD 
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .PERIOD 
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .PERIOD 
We could look across time at the same people -DASH -DASH people ,COMMA for example ,COMMA who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -DASH -DASH and ask what the contribution of mothering ,COMMA of genetics are ,COMMA and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .PERIOD 
And best of all ,COMMA we were able ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments .PERIOD 
And then we were able to test them rigorously ,COMMA in random assignment ,COMMA placebo controlled designs ,COMMA throw out the things that didn't work ,COMMA keep the things that actively did .PERIOD 
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry ,COMMA over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .PERIOD 
And I think that's terrific .PERIOD I'm proud of it .PERIOD 
But what was not good ,COMMA the consequences of that were three things .PERIOD 
The first was moral ,COMMA that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists ,COMMA pathologizers ,COMMA that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble ,COMMA bricks fell on you .PERIOD 
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .PERIOD 
We forgot responsibility .PERIOD That was the first cost .PERIOD 
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .PERIOD 
We forgot about improving normal lives .PERIOD 
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier ,COMMA more fulfilled ,COMMA more productive .PERIOD And genius ,COMMA high-talent ,COMMA became a dirty word .PERIOD 
No one works on that .PERIOD 
And the third problem about the disease model is ,COMMA in our rush to do something about people in trouble ,COMMA in our rush to do something about repairing damage ,COMMA it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier ,COMMA positive interventions .PERIOD 
So that was not good .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff ,COMMA Dan Gilbert ,COMMA Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology ,COMMA which has three aims .PERIOD 
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness .PERIOD 
It should be interested in the best things in life .PERIOD 
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling ,COMMA and with genius ,COMMA with nurturing high talent .PERIOD 
So in the last <NUM> years and the hope for the future ,COMMA we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology ,COMMA a science of what makes life worth living .PERIOD 
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .PERIOD 
And any of you ,COMMA for free ,COMMA can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness .PERIOD 
You can ask ,COMMA how do you stack up for positive emotion ,COMMA for meaning ,COMMA for flow ,COMMA against literally tens of thousands of other people ?QUESTIONMARK 
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities :COLON a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio ,COMMA how they're defined ,COMMA how to diagnose them ,COMMA what builds them and what gets in their way .PERIOD 
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states ,COMMA the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness .PERIOD 
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people ,COMMA and I've asked the question ,COMMA how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it turns out there's one way .PERIOD 
They're not more religious ,COMMA they're not in better shape ,COMMA they don't have more money ,COMMA they're not better looking ,COMMA they don't have more good events and fewer bad events .PERIOD 
The one way in which they differ :COLON they're extremely social .PERIOD 
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning .PERIOD 
They don't spend time alone .PERIOD 
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends .PERIOD 
But watch out here .PERIOD This is merely correlational data ,COMMA not causal ,COMMA and it's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I'm going to talk about :COLON happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer .PERIOD 
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough ,COMMA in just a moment .PERIOD 
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries ,COMMA from the Buddha to Tony Robbins .PERIOD 
About <NUM> interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy .PERIOD 
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them ,COMMA and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?QUESTIONMARK 
In a couple of minutes ,COMMA I'll tell you about some of those results .PERIOD 
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have ,COMMA in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill ,COMMA and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable ,COMMA is can psychology actually make people happier ?QUESTIONMARK 
And to ask that question -DASH -DASH happy is not a word I use very much -DASH -DASH we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy .PERIOD 
And I believe there are three different -DASH -DASH and I call them different because different interventions build them ,COMMA it's possible to have one rather than the other -DASH -DASH three different happy lives .PERIOD 
The first happy life is the pleasant life .PERIOD 
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can ,COMMA and the skills to amplify it .PERIOD 
The second is a life of engagement -DASH -DASH a life in your work ,COMMA your parenting ,COMMA your love ,COMMA your leisure ,COMMA time stops for you .PERIOD 
And third ,COMMA the meaningful life .PERIOD 
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .PERIOD 
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks ,COMMA and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here .PERIOD 
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life ,COMMA your experience of positive emotion ,COMMA is heritable ,COMMA about <NUM> percent heritable ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA not very modifiable .PERIOD 
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are <NUM> to <NUM> percent tricks ,COMMA getting more of it .PERIOD 
Second is that positive emotion habituates .PERIOD It habituates rapidly ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD 
It's all like French vanilla ice cream ,COMMA the first taste is a <NUM> percent ;SEMICOLON by the time you're down to the sixth taste ,COMMA it's gone .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA it's not particularly malleable .PERIOD 
And this leads to the second life .PERIOD 
And I have to tell you about my friend ,COMMA Len ,COMMA to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion ,COMMA more than building pleasure .PERIOD 
By the time he was <NUM> ,COMMA he was an options trader .PERIOD 
By the time he was <NUM> ,COMMA he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company .PERIOD 
Second ,COMMA in play -DASH -DASH he's a national champion bridge player .PERIOD 
But in the third great arena of life ,COMMA love ,COMMA Len is an abysmal failure .PERIOD 
And the reason he was ,COMMA was that Len is a cold fish .PERIOD 
Len is an introvert .PERIOD 
American women said to Len ,COMMA when he dated them ,COMMA You're no fun .PERIOD You don't have positive emotion .PERIOD Get lost .PERIOD 
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst ,COMMA who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him .PERIOD 
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma .PERIOD 
The question is ,COMMA is Len unhappy ?QUESTIONMARK And I want to say not .PERIOD 
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom <NUM> percent of the human race in positive affectivity ,COMMA I think Len is one of the happiest people I know .PERIOD 
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len ,COMMA like most of you ,COMMA is enormously capable of flow .PERIOD 
When the first card is played ,COMMA until <NUM> days later ,COMMA the tournament is over ,COMMA time stops for Len .PERIOD 
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about ,COMMA about flow .PERIOD And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way .PERIOD 
Pleasure has raw feels :COLON you know it's happening .PERIOD It's thought and feeling .PERIOD 
But what Mike told you yesterday -DASH -DASH during flow ,COMMA you can't feel anything .PERIOD 
You're one with the music .PERIOD Time stops .PERIOD 
You have intense concentration .PERIOD 
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life .PERIOD 
And again ,COMMA there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are .PERIOD 
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .PERIOD 
Re-crafting your work ,COMMA your love ,COMMA your play ,COMMA your friendship ,COMMA your parenting .PERIOD 
Hated the job .PERIOD 
She's working her way through college .PERIOD 
But what she did was to take her highest strengths ,COMMA and re-craft work to use them as much as possible .PERIOD 
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds .PERIOD 
You don't giggle a lot .PERIOD What you get is more absorption .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's the second path .PERIOD The first path ,COMMA positive emotion .PERIOD 
The second path is eudaimonian flow .PERIOD 
And the third path is meaning .PERIOD 
This is the most venerable of the happinesses ,COMMA traditionally .PERIOD 
And meaning ,COMMA in this view ,COMMA consists of -DASH -DASH very parallel to eudaimonia -DASH -DASH it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are ,COMMA and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .PERIOD 
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives ,COMMA the pleasant life ,COMMA the good life ,COMMA the meaningful life ,COMMA people are now hard at work on the question ,COMMA are there things that lastingly change those lives ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the answer seems to be yes .PERIOD And I'll just give you some samples of it .PERIOD 
It's being done in a rigorous manner .PERIOD 
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works .PERIOD 
So we do random assignment ,COMMA placebo controlled ,COMMA long-term studies of different interventions .PERIOD 
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect ,COMMA when we teach people about the pleasant life ,COMMA how to have more pleasure in your life ,COMMA one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills ,COMMA the savoring skills ,COMMA and you're assigned to design a beautiful day .PERIOD 
Next Saturday ,COMMA set a day aside ,COMMA design yourself a beautiful day ,COMMA and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures .PERIOD 
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced .PERIOD 
Gratitude visit .PERIOD I want you all to do this with me now ,COMMA if you would .PERIOD 
Close your eyes .PERIOD 
The person has to be alive .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA OK ,COMMA you can open your eyes .PERIOD 
Your assignment ,COMMA when you're learning the gratitude visit ,COMMA is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person ,COMMA call them on the phone in Phoenix ,COMMA ask if you can visit ,COMMA don't tell them why ,COMMA show up at their door ,COMMA you read the testimonial -DASH -DASH everyone weeps when this happens .PERIOD 
And what happens is when we test people one week later ,COMMA a month later ,COMMA three months later ,COMMA they're both happier and less depressed .PERIOD 
Another example is a strength date ,COMMA in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test ,COMMA and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths ,COMMA and we find this is a strengthener of relationships .PERIOD 
And fun versus philanthropy .PERIOD 
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this ,COMMA in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this ,COMMA so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun ,COMMA and to contrast it .PERIOD 
And what you find is when you do something fun ,COMMA it has a square wave walk set .PERIOD 
When you do something philanthropic to help another person ,COMMA it lasts and it lasts .PERIOD 
So those are examples of positive interventions .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have .PERIOD 
And this is really what you're about .PERIOD And that's our target variable .PERIOD 
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives ,COMMA how much life satisfaction do you get ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we ask -DASH -DASH and we've done this in <NUM> replications involving thousands of people -DASH -DASH to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure ,COMMA the pursuit of positive emotion ,COMMA the pleasant life ,COMMA the pursuit of engagement ,COMMA time stopping for you ,COMMA and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction ?QUESTIONMARK 
And our results surprised us ,COMMA but they were backward of what we thought .PERIOD 
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction .PERIOD 
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .PERIOD 
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .PERIOD 
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning ,COMMA then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry .PERIOD 
Which is to say ,COMMA the full life -DASH -DASH the sum is greater than the parts ,COMMA if you've got all three .PERIOD 
Conversely ,COMMA if you have none of the three ,COMMA the empty life ,COMMA the sum is less than the parts .PERIOD 
And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship ,COMMA physical health ,COMMA morbidity ,COMMA how long you live and productivity ,COMMA follow the same relationship ?QUESTIONMARK 
That is ,COMMA in a corporation ,COMMA is productivity a function of positive emotion ,COMMA engagement and meaning ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is health a function of positive engagement ,COMMA of pleasure ,COMMA and of meaning in life ?QUESTIONMARK 
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard ,COMMA and so this was amazing for me .PERIOD I've never been in a gathering like this .PERIOD 
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much ,COMMA which was one of the remarkable things .PERIOD 
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology ,COMMA entertainment and design in the following way .PERIOD 
We all know that technology ,COMMA entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes .PERIOD 
We also know that technology ,COMMA entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important .PERIOD 
I thought ,COMMA when I first became a therapist <NUM> years ago ,COMMA that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed ,COMMA not anxious ,COMMA not angry ,COMMA that I'd make them happy .PERIOD 
And I never found that .PERIOD I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero .PERIOD 
And it turns out the skills of happiness ,COMMA the skills of the pleasant life ,COMMA the skills of engagement ,COMMA the skills of meaning ,COMMA are different from the skills of relieving misery .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness ,COMMA to increase positive emotion ,COMMA and that's typically how they've been used .PERIOD 
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -DASH -DASH not just positive emotion ,COMMA that's not nearly enough -DASH -DASH there's flow in life ,COMMA and there's meaning in life .PERIOD 
As Laura Lee told us ,COMMA design ,COMMA and ,COMMA I believe ,COMMA entertainment and technology ,COMMA can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well .PERIOD 
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion ,COMMA meaning ,COMMA eudaimonia ,COMMA it will be good enough .PERIOD 
And if design can increase positive emotion ,COMMA eudaimonia ,COMMA and flow and meaning ,COMMA what we're all doing together will become good enough .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs .PERIOD 
This is an icon of National Geographic ,COMMA an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry .PERIOD 
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic ,COMMA and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA the wrath of Photoshop .PERIOD 
This is a jet landing at San Francisco ,COMMA by Bruce Dale .PERIOD 
He mounted a camera on the tail .PERIOD 
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy ,COMMA by Sam Abell .PERIOD 
Pygmies in the DRC ,COMMA by Randy Olson .PERIOD 
I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer .PERIOD 
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic ,COMMA by Paul Nicklen .PERIOD 
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth -DASH -DASH they're not very good swimmers -DASH -DASH and we know what's happening to the ice .PERIOD 
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa ,COMMA photographed by Chris Johns .PERIOD 
Shot straight down ,COMMA so these are the shadows of the camels .PERIOD 
This is a rancher in Texas ,COMMA by William Albert Allard ,COMMA a great portraitist .PERIOD 
And Jane Goodall ,COMMA making her own special connection ,COMMA photographed by Nick Nichols .PERIOD 
This is a soap disco in Spain ,COMMA photographed by David Alan Harvey .PERIOD 
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA hey ,COMMA at least it's hygienic .PERIOD 
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance ,COMMA by David Doubilet .PERIOD 
And this is a comet ,COMMA captured by Dr .PERIOD Euan Mason .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA the bow of the Titanic ,COMMA without movie stars ,COMMA photographed by Emory Kristof .PERIOD 
Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated ,COMMA media world ,COMMA because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment .PERIOD 
But I turned away for a moment ,COMMA and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty .PERIOD 
I can stand here right now and see ,COMMA as I go tearing into the water after him ,COMMA the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement .PERIOD 
I can see the rocks are over here .PERIOD 
There's a wave about to crash onto him .PERIOD 
I can see his hands reaching out ,COMMA and I can see his face in terror ,COMMA looking at me ,COMMA saying ,COMMA Help me ,COMMA Dad .PERIOD 
I got him .PERIOD The wave broke over us .PERIOD 
We got back on shore ;SEMICOLON he was fine .PERIOD 
We were a little bit rattled .PERIOD 
But this flashbulb memory ,COMMA as it's called ,COMMA is when all the elements came together to define not just the event ,COMMA but my emotional connection to it .PERIOD 
And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer .PERIOD 
Now I have to tell you ,COMMA I was talking to Kyle last week about this ,COMMA that I was going to tell this story .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA I remember that too !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me .PERIOD 
I thought I was a hero .PERIOD 
This photograph was taken by Dr .PERIOD Euan Mason in New Zealand last year ,COMMA and it was submitted and published in National Geographic .PERIOD 
Last year ,COMMA we added a section to our website called Your Shot ,COMMA where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication .PERIOD 
And it has become a wild success ,COMMA tapping into the enthusiast photography community .PERIOD 
The quality of these amateur photographs can ,COMMA at times ,COMMA be amazing .PERIOD 
And seeing this reinforces ,COMMA for me ,COMMA that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them .PERIOD 
You've got to be able to make them all the time .PERIOD 
But even more importantly ,COMMA you need to know how to create a visual narrative .PERIOD 
You need to know how to tell a story .PERIOD 
So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography .PERIOD 
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad ,COMMA called Zakouma .PERIOD 
The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species ,COMMA of an exotic locale .PERIOD 
And that is what Nick did ,COMMA up to a point .PERIOD 
This is a serval cat .PERIOD 
He's actually taking his own picture ,COMMA shot with what's called a camera trap .PERIOD 
There's an infrared beam that's going across ,COMMA and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph .PERIOD 
These are baboons at a watering hole .PERIOD 
Nick -DASH -DASH the camera ,COMMA again ,COMMA an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this .PERIOD 
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons .PERIOD 
A lion having a late night snack -DASH -DASH notice he's got a broken tooth .PERIOD 
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .PERIOD 
I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail .PERIOD 
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa .PERIOD 
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight ,COMMA something that digital photography has made a big difference for .PERIOD 
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted .PERIOD 
Nick ,COMMA along with researcher Dr .PERIOD Michael Fay ,COMMA collared the matriarch of the herd .PERIOD 
They named her Annie ,COMMA and they began tracking her movements .PERIOD 
The herd was safe within the confines of the park ,COMMA because of this dedicated group of park rangers .PERIOD 
But once the annual rains began ,COMMA the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park .PERIOD 
And that's when they ran into trouble .PERIOD 
For outside the safety of the park were poachers ,COMMA who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks .PERIOD 
The matriarch that they were radio tracking ,COMMA after weeks of moving back and forth ,COMMA in and out of the park ,COMMA came to a halt outside the park .PERIOD 
Annie had been killed ,COMMA along with <NUM> members of her herd .PERIOD 
And they only came for the ivory .PERIOD 
This is actually one of the rangers .PERIOD 
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory ,COMMA because they couldn't leave it there ,COMMA because it's still valuable .PERIOD 
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight ,COMMA Isn't this an amazing world ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now let's go over to India .PERIOD 
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way .PERIOD 
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project .PERIOD 
For the first time in history ,COMMA more people live in urban ,COMMA rather than rural ,COMMA environments .PERIOD 
And most of that growth is not in the cities ,COMMA but in the slums that surround them .PERIOD 
Jonas Bendiksen ,COMMA a very energetic photographer ,COMMA came to me and said ,COMMA We need to document this ,COMMA and here's my proposal .PERIOD 
Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA you know ,COMMA that might be a bit ambitious for our budget .PERIOD 
So instead ,COMMA what we did was we decided to ,COMMA instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story -DASH -DASH where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -DASH -DASH we put Jonas into Dharavi ,COMMA which is part of Mumbai ,COMMA India ,COMMA and let him stay there ,COMMA and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city .PERIOD 
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places .PERIOD 
By staying tightly focused in one place ,COMMA Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community .PERIOD 
And he did it in a beautiful way .PERIOD 
Sometimes ,COMMA though ,COMMA the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture .PERIOD 
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries .PERIOD 
We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject ,COMMA but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA in a photo by Brian ,COMMA a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja .PERIOD 
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch ,COMMA the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species .PERIOD 
But here ,COMMA Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard .PERIOD 
And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom .PERIOD 
Back on land ,COMMA Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa ,COMMA where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals ,COMMA the main parts having already been sent to Europe .PERIOD 
And here in China ,COMMA Randy shot a jellyfish market .PERIOD 
As prime food sources are depleted ,COMMA the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein .PERIOD 
This is called fishing down the food chain .PERIOD 
But there are also glimmers of hope ,COMMA and I think anytime we're doing a big ,COMMA big story on this ,COMMA we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems .PERIOD 
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand ,COMMA where commercial fishing had been banned -DASH -DASH the result being that the overfished species have been restored ,COMMA and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries .PERIOD 
Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial .PERIOD 
James Nachtwey ,COMMA who was honored at last year's TED ,COMMA took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq .PERIOD 
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home ,COMMA on the other .PERIOD 
Jim started in the battlefield .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital .PERIOD 
Here is in the field hospital .PERIOD 
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest ,COMMA as a reminder of home .PERIOD 
From here ,COMMA the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany ,COMMA where they meet up with their families for the first time .PERIOD 
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals ,COMMA such as here in Walter Reed .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA often fitted with high-tech prosthesis ,COMMA they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics .PERIOD 
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals .PERIOD 
They have been rarely photographed ,COMMA partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA a year earlier ,COMMA a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed .PERIOD 
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what leopard seals do mostly is ,COMMA they eat penguins .PERIOD 
You know of The March of the Penguins .PERIOD 
This is sort of the munch of the penguins .PERIOD 
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear .PERIOD 
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out .PERIOD 
But then Paul got in the water .PERIOD 
And he said he was never really afraid of this .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA this one female came up to him .PERIOD 
She's probably -DASH -DASH it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph ,COMMA but she's <NUM> feet long .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA she is pretty significant in size .PERIOD 
And Paul said he was never really afraid ,COMMA because she was more curious about him than threatened .PERIOD 
This mouthing behavior ,COMMA on the right ,COMMA was really her way of saying to him ,COMMA Hey ,COMMA look how big I am !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Or you know ,COMMA My ,COMMA what big teeth you have .PERIOD 
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him .PERIOD 
To her ,COMMA here was this big ,COMMA goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins .PERIOD 
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him ,COMMA alive ,COMMA and put them in front of him .PERIOD 
She dropped them off ,COMMA and then they would swim away .PERIOD 
She'd kind of look at him ,COMMA like What are you doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Go back and get them ,COMMA and then bring them back and drop them in front of him .PERIOD 
And she did this over the course of a couple of days ,COMMA until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head .PERIOD 
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph .PERIOD 
Eventually ,COMMA though ,COMMA Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive .PERIOD 
This is her just puffing out ,COMMA you know ,COMMA snorting out in disgust .PERIOD 
And lost interest with him ,COMMA and went back to what she does best .PERIOD 
Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature ,COMMA and came back with not just a collection of photographs ,COMMA but an amazing experience and a great story .PERIOD 
It is these kinds of stories ,COMMA ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism .PERIOD 
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people ,COMMA and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today .PERIOD 
I don't speak English .PERIOD 
I start speaking English ,COMMA learning English ,COMMA about a year ago .PERIOD 
I speak French and I grew up with French ,COMMA so my English is Franglais .PERIOD 
I'm born in the Western Congo ,COMMA in an area around here ,COMMA and then went to university in Kisangani .PERIOD 
And after I finished ,COMMA I went to this area ,COMMA the Ituri Forest .PERIOD 
But what I've been doing -DASH -DASH when I was about <NUM> ,COMMA I grew in my uncle's house .PERIOD 
What I've been doing from <NUM> to <NUM> was ,COMMA I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk ,COMMA meat and whatever they were killing ,COMMA poaching ,COMMA hunting in the forest ,COMMA bring it in the main city to get access to the market .PERIOD 
But finally ,COMMA I got myself involved .PERIOD 
Around <NUM> to <NUM> years ,COMMA I became ,COMMA myself ,COMMA a poacher .PERIOD 
And I wanted to do it ,COMMA because -DASH -DASH I believed -DASH -DASH to continue my studies .PERIOD 
I wanted to go to university ,COMMA but my father was poor ,COMMA my uncle even .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I did it .PERIOD 
And for three to four years ,COMMA I went to university .PERIOD 
I didn't succeed .PERIOD 
I was having my inscriptions ,COMMA my admission to biology .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA No way ,COMMA I'm not doing it .PERIOD 
My family's poor ,COMMA my area don't have better health care .PERIOD 
I want to be a doctor to serve them .PERIOD 
Three times ,COMMA that means three years ,COMMA and I start getting old .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA Oh ,COMMA no ,COMMA I continue .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I did tropical ecology and plant botany .PERIOD 
When I finished ,COMMA I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship .PERIOD 
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing right up to now -DASH -DASH I'm standing in front of you -DASH -DASH doing botany and wildlife conservation .PERIOD 
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants .PERIOD 
And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number -DASH -DASH I think that is the largest number of elephants we have right now in protected areas in Congo .PERIOD 
It has also chimpanzees .PERIOD 
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature .PERIOD 
That is a forest giraffe .PERIOD 
I think you guys know it quite well .PERIOD 
Here we have savanna giraffes ,COMMA but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in Congo .PERIOD 
It has also some beautiful primates .PERIOD 
Thirteen species -DASH -DASH highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa .PERIOD 
And it has the Ituri Forest itself -DASH -DASH about <NUM> species of plants ,COMMA so far known .PERIOD 
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society ,COMMA working there ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA but I started working with them as a student in <NUM> .PERIOD 
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor .PERIOD 
But I didn't like the way -DASH -DASH the instruction I got was very poor .PERIOD 
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center .PERIOD 
And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it .PERIOD 
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo ,COMMA so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated .PERIOD 
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there ,COMMA so there was a road from Goma ,COMMA somewhere here ,COMMA and coming like this .PERIOD 
So they might go through ,COMMA pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve .PERIOD 
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area ,COMMA and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them .PERIOD 
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve .PERIOD 
On their way ,COMMA they looted everything .PERIOD 
Torture ,COMMA wars -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA my God ,COMMA you can't believe .PERIOD 
Every person was looking his way -DASH -DASH where to go ,COMMA we don't know .PERIOD 
And it was for us ,COMMA the young ,COMMA the first time really we hear the language of war ,COMMA of guns .PERIOD 
And even people who faced the rebellion of <NUM> ,COMMA after our independence ,COMMA they didn't believe what was happening .PERIOD 
They were killing people .PERIOD They were doing whatever they want because they have power .PERIOD 
Who have been doing that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Young children .PERIOD Child soldiers .PERIOD 
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns .PERIOD 
But I was from the west ,COMMA working in the east .PERIOD 
I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili .PERIOD 
And when they came ,COMMA they looted everything .PERIOD 
You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu ,COMMA and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier .PERIOD 
And I was from the same area to him .PERIOD 
I stay .PERIOD If I go ,COMMA I will be killed .PERIOD 
I can't go back to my area -DASH -DASH it's more than <NUM> kilometers [away] .PERIOD 
I stayed after they looted everything .PERIOD 
We have been doing research on botany ,COMMA and we have a small herbarium of <NUM> sheets of plants .PERIOD 
We cut ,COMMA we dry and we packed them ,COMMA we mounted them on a folder .PERIOD 
Purpose :COLON so that we start them for agriculture ,COMMA for medicine ,COMMA for whatever ,COMMA and for science ,COMMA for the study of the flora and the change of the forest .PERIOD 
That is people moving around ,COMMA that's even Pygmies .PERIOD 
And this is a bright guy ,COMMA hard-working person ,COMMA and Pygmy .PERIOD 
I've been working with him about <NUM> years .PERIOD 
And with soldiers ,COMMA they went to the forest for poaching elephants .PERIOD 
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest .PERIOD 
And what I did ,COMMA I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis .PERIOD 
And fortunately ,COMMA I saved his life .PERIOD 
And that was the language of the war .PERIOD 
And what of important things -DASH -DASH I think all of you here have a cell phone .PERIOD 
That mineral has killed a lot :COLON five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo-Tantalite -DASH -DASH they call it Coltan -DASH -DASH that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area ,COMMA all over in Congo .PERIOD Extraction ,COMMA and good ,COMMA big business of the war .PERIOD 
And what I did for the first war ,COMMA after we have lost everything ,COMMA I have to save something ,COMMA even myself ,COMMA my life and life of the staff .PERIOD 
I buried some of our new vehicle engines ,COMMA I buried it to save it .PERIOD 
And some of equipment went with them ,COMMA on the top of the canopy ,COMMA to save it .PERIOD 
He's not collecting plants ,COMMA he's going to save our equipment on the canopy .PERIOD 
And with the material that's left -DASH -DASH because they wanted to destroy it ,COMMA to burn it ,COMMA they didn't understand it ,COMMA they didn't go to school -DASH -DASH I packed it .PERIOD 
And that is me ,COMMA going to ,COMMA hurrying to Uganda ,COMMA to try to save that <NUM> material ,COMMA with people carrying them on the bikes ,COMMA bicycles .PERIOD 
And after that ,COMMA we succeeded .PERIOD 
I housed that <NUM> material at the herbarium of Makerere University .PERIOD 
And after the war ,COMMA I have been able to bring it back home ,COMMA so that we continue our studies .PERIOD 
The second war came while we didn't expect it .PERIOD 
With friends ,COMMA we had been sitting and watching match football ,COMMA and having some good music with WorldSpace radio ,COMMA when it started ,COMMA I think .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it was so bad .PERIOD 
We heard that now from the east again the war started ,COMMA and it's going fast .PERIOD 
This time I think Kabila will go in place of ,COMMA as he did with Mobutu .PERIOD 
And the reserve was a target to the rebels .PERIOD 
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources .PERIOD 
And there was no way to work .PERIOD 
They destroy everything .PERIOD 
Poaching -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA no way .PERIOD 
And that's the powerful men .PERIOD We have to meet and to talk to them .PERIOD 
What's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they can't do what they are doing .PERIOD 
So we went to meet them .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we started talking with them ,COMMA convincing them that we are in a protected area .PERIOD 
There are regulations that it's prohibited to do logging ,COMMA mining and poaching ,COMMA specifically .PERIOD 
But they said ,COMMA You guys ,COMMA you think that soldiers who are dying are not important ,COMMA and your animals you are protecting are most important .PERIOD 
We don't think so .PERIOD 
I say ,COMMA No way ,COMMA you are not going to do it here .PERIOD 
We started talking with them and I was negotiating .PERIOD 
Tried to protect our equipment ,COMMA tried to protect our staff and the villages of about <NUM> people .PERIOD 
And we continued .PERIOD 
But I was doing that ,COMMA negotiating with them .PERIOD 
Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba ,COMMA with Mbusa Nyamwisi ,COMMA with Kabila ,COMMA and I'm there .PERIOD 
Sometimes ,COMMA they talk to my own language ,COMMA that is ,COMMA Lingala .PERIOD 
I hear it and what strategy they are doing ,COMMA what they are planning .PERIOD 
Sometimes ,COMMA they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on .PERIOD 
They used me to carry that ,COMMA and I was doing counting ,COMMA what comes from where ,COMMA and where ,COMMA and where .PERIOD 
I had only this equipment -DASH -DASH my satellite phone ,COMMA my computer and a plastic solar panel -DASH -DASH that I hide it in the forest .PERIOD 
And every time ,COMMA daily ,COMMA after we have meeting ,COMMA what compromise we have ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA I go ,COMMA I write a short email ,COMMA send it .PERIOD 
I don't know how many people I had on my address .PERIOD 
I sent the message :COLON what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do .PERIOD 
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning ,COMMA and the afternoon ,COMMA it's on the news ,COMMA BBC ,COMMA RFI .PERIOD 
Something might be going on .PERIOD 
And one day ,COMMA we went for a meeting .PERIOD 
Sorry .PERIOD 
One day ,COMMA we went to meet the Chief Commander .PERIOD 
He had the same iridium cell phone like me .PERIOD 
And he asked me ,COMMA Do you know how to use this ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA I have never seen it .PERIOD 
I don't know .PERIOD 
And I had mine on my pocket .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it was a chance that they trusted me a lot .PERIOD 
They didn't -DASH -DASH they was not looking on me .PERIOD 
So I was scared .PERIOD 
And when we finished the meeting ,COMMA I went to return it in the forest .PERIOD 
And I was sending news ,COMMA doing whatever ,COMMA reporting daily to the U.N. ,COMMA to UNESCO ,COMMA to our institution in New York ,COMMA what have been going .PERIOD 
And for that ,COMMA they have been having big pressure to leave ,COMMA to free the area .PERIOD 
Because there was no way -DASH -DASH whatever they do ,COMMA it's known the same time .PERIOD 
During the first two rebellions ,COMMA they killed all animals in the zoo .PERIOD 
We have a zoo of <NUM> Okapis ,COMMA and one of them was pregnant .PERIOD 
And during the war ,COMMA after a week of heavy war ,COMMA fighting in the area ,COMMA we succeeded :COLON we had the first Okapi .PERIOD 
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this .PERIOD 
This is not local population ,COMMA this is rebels .PERIOD 
They are now happy sending the news that they have protected the Okapi with the war ,COMMA because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere .PERIOD 
And I was mad .PERIOD 
I oppose it -DASH -DASH that they are now going to dissect it ,COMMA until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander .PERIOD 
And I succeeded .PERIOD 
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks .PERIOD 
What we are doing after that -DASH -DASH that was the situation of the war -DASH -DASH we have to rebuild .PERIOD 
I had some money .PERIOD I was paid <NUM> dollars .PERIOD 
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants .PERIOD 
I started this with <NUM> dollars ,COMMA and start fundraising money to where I've been going .PERIOD 
I had opportunity to go all over ,COMMA where herbarium for my African material is .PERIOD 
And they supported me a bit ,COMMA and I built this .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it's doing work to train young Congolese .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA what one of the speciality we are doing ,COMMA my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity ,COMMA and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon .PERIOD 
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot ,COMMA where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters ,COMMA and we are tracking them .PERIOD 
We have now data of about <NUM> years ,COMMA to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions .PERIOD 
And that is -DASH -DASH I think it's difficult for me .PERIOD 
This is a very embarrassing talk ,COMMA I know .PERIOD 
I don't know where to start ,COMMA where to finish it .PERIOD 
When I was thinking to come here ,COMMA what best title I wanted to say to my talk ,COMMA I didn't find this .PERIOD 
But now I think that I would have titled it ,COMMA The Language of Guns .PERIOD 
Where are you people ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now we are talking about reconstitution ,COMMA rebuild Africa .PERIOD 
I think we see the war like a game -DASH -DASH like soccer ,COMMA football .PERIOD 
Everybody is happy ,COMMA but see what it's doing ,COMMA see what is going in Darfur .PERIOD 
Now we say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA my God .PERIOD 
See what the wars in Rwanda .PERIOD 
That's because of the language of guns .PERIOD 
I don't think that someone may blame Google ,COMMA because it's doing the right things ,COMMA even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google to connect between them .PERIOD 
But it's serving millions for the best .PERIOD 
But what is doing with gun industries ?QUESTIONMARK 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON Thank you ,COMMA thank you .PERIOD 
Just wait over there .PERIOD 
It's an amazing story .PERIOD 
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have .PERIOD 
How can we help you ?QUESTIONMARK 
Corneille Ewango :COLON That's really embarrassing questions .PERIOD 
I think that now I feel nervous .PERIOD 
And I think ,COMMA helping us ,COMMA people are acting sometimes by ignorance .PERIOD 
I did it myself .PERIOD 
If I know when I was young ,COMMA that [by] killing an elephant ,COMMA I'm destroying biodiversity ,COMMA I would not have done it .PERIOD 
Many ,COMMA many of you have seen the talents of Africans ,COMMA but there are few who are going to school .PERIOD 
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics ,COMMA HIV ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA poverty ,COMMA not going to school .PERIOD 
What you can assist us ,COMMA it's by building capacities .PERIOD 
How many have got opportunity like me to go to U.S. ,COMMA do a master's ?QUESTIONMARK 
And go -DASH -DASH now ,COMMA I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D .PERIOD 
But many of them are just here ,COMMA because they don't have money .PERIOD 
They can't even attain the bachelor's degree .PERIOD 
Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa .PERIOD 
They are very important to how we communicate with each other .PERIOD 
As a result ,COMMA we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering ,COMMA in order to believe whether these things are realistic .PERIOD 
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face ,COMMA using some computer graphics technology we've developed ,COMMA and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics .PERIOD 
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien ,COMMA who is right there .PERIOD 
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face .PERIOD 
By the end of the talk ,COMMA we're going to see it move .PERIOD 
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself ,COMMA who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey ,COMMA and sit for a session in Light Stage <NUM> .PERIOD 
This is a face-scanning sphere ,COMMA with <NUM> white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions .PERIOD 
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this .PERIOD 
And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face ,COMMA and different principle directions of light from the light stage ,COMMA to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face .PERIOD 
And in addition ,COMMA we've actually used polarizers on all the lights -DASH -DASH just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road ,COMMA polarizers can block the shine off of the skin ,COMMA so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit ,COMMA we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in ,COMMA and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point .PERIOD 
If you take the difference between these two images here ,COMMA you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin .PERIOD 
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this .PERIOD 
And this is very important light to capture ,COMMA because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin .PERIOD 
It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as a result ,COMMA it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have ,COMMA the things that actually make us look like real humans .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection ,COMMA we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape ,COMMA and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA even more importantly ,COMMA since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture ,COMMA we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon ,COMMA in many different facial poses and facial expressions .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA here you can see her moving her eyes around ,COMMA moving her mouth around .PERIOD 
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character .PERIOD 
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily ,COMMA you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions .PERIOD 
You can see things .PERIOD Not only the face shape changes ,COMMA but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs .PERIOD 
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture .PERIOD 
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there .PERIOD 
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down .PERIOD 
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that .PERIOD 
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry ,COMMA since it's all captured with cameras ,COMMA we've got a great texture map to use for the face .PERIOD 
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination ,COMMA the red and the green and the blue ,COMMA diffuse the light differently ,COMMA we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA instead of looking like a plaster mannequin ,COMMA it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh .PERIOD 
And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged ,COMMA digital version of Emily .PERIOD 
But they basically created a digital puppet of her ,COMMA where you can pull on these various strings ,COMMA and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA in addition to the coarse-scale geometry ,COMMA they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called displacement maps that animate as well .PERIOD 
These are the displacement maps here .PERIOD 
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates .PERIOD 
So the next process was then to animate her .PERIOD 
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques ,COMMA they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer-generated performance .PERIOD 
So what you're going to see now ,COMMA after this ,COMMA is a completely photo-real digital face .PERIOD 
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available .PERIOD 
Emily :COLON Image Metrics is a markerless ,COMMA performance-driven animation company .PERIOD 
We specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films .PERIOD 
Image Metrics is a markerless ,COMMA performance-driven animation company .PERIOD 
We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films .PERIOD 
Paul Debevec :COLON So ,COMMA if we break that down into layers ,COMMA here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide .PERIOD 
Here is the specular component animating .PERIOD 
You can see all the wrinkles happening there .PERIOD 
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh .PERIOD 
And that is Emily herself .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA where are we going with this here ?QUESTIONMARK 
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage <NUM> .PERIOD This is Light Stage <NUM> ,COMMA and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies .PERIOD 
This is Bruce Lawmen ,COMMA one of our researchers in the group ,COMMA who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage .PERIOD 
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce ,COMMA running in a new environment .PERIOD 
First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss .PERIOD 
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing .PERIOD 
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about .PERIOD 
One of the things that's changed here ,COMMA in the last <NUM> years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like ,COMMA is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about .PERIOD 
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity .PERIOD 
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight .PERIOD 
When you go on a thing like this ,COMMA we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months ,COMMA with a team as small as <NUM> or <NUM> ,COMMA to as big as <NUM> .PERIOD 
And a lot of people ask me ,COMMA you know ,COMMA what kind of people do you get for a project like this ?QUESTIONMARK 
While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA ,COMMA it's nonetheless thorough .PERIOD 
We're looking for competence ,COMMA discipline ,COMMA endurance ,COMMA and strength .PERIOD 
In case you're wondering ,COMMA this is our strength test .PERIOD 
But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations .PERIOD 
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance .PERIOD 
From the entrance ,COMMA this is nothing like a commercial cave .PERIOD 
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2 ,COMMA not K2 ,COMMA but J2 .PERIOD 
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse ,COMMA except that you're now running a string of these things down .PERIOD 
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there ,COMMA otherwise in damp ,COMMA moist ,COMMA cold conditions in utterly dark places .PERIOD 
I should mention that everything you're seeing here ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is artificially illuminated at great effort .PERIOD 
The deeper you go ,COMMA the more you run into a conflict with water .PERIOD 
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down .PERIOD 
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice .PERIOD 
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s .PERIOD 
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico .PERIOD 
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous .PERIOD 
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film .PERIOD 
Along that same line ,COMMA I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year ,COMMA we have never seen monsters underground -DASH -DASH at least the kind that eat you .PERIOD 
If there is a monster underground ,COMMA it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance .PERIOD 
We're going to be shooting from minus <NUM> meters -DASH -DASH that's a little over <NUM> feet down -DASH -DASH at <NUM> kilometers from the entrance .PERIOD 
The lead crews will be underground for pushing <NUM> days straight .PERIOD 
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time .PERIOD 
Eventually ,COMMA if you keep going down in these things ,COMMA probability says that you're going to run into a place like this .PERIOD 
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof .PERIOD 
And when you used to find these things ,COMMA they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon .PERIOD 
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons .PERIOD 
Number one ,COMMA it's the name of my rock band ,COMMA and second ,COMMA is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor .PERIOD 
And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this .PERIOD 
This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle .PERIOD 
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of <NUM> meters straight down underwater .PERIOD 
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA .PERIOD 
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space ,COMMA but at much greater distances ,COMMA and at much greater physical peril .PERIOD 
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range ,COMMA away from a safe haven .PERIOD 
Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before .PERIOD 
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet .PERIOD 
To experience it is a privilege .PERIOD 
Bill Stone :COLON That was taken in Wakulla Springs ,COMMA Florida .PERIOD 
Couple of things to note about that movie .PERIOD Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before <NUM> .PERIOD 
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .PERIOD 
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper ,COMMA and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave ,COMMA and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs .PERIOD 
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world .PERIOD 
This is Europa .PERIOD 
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day .PERIOD 
For those who have never seen this story ,COMMA Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago ,COMMA called Aliens of the Deep .PERIOD 
There was a brief clip -DASH -DASH Narrator :COLON A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge .PERIOD 
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light ,COMMA it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle .PERIOD 
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice .PERIOD 
Now we have to get through the ice .PERIOD 
You need a melt probe .PERIOD 
The ice could be anywhere from three to <NUM> miles deep .PERIOD 
Week after week ,COMMA the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice ,COMMA until finally -DASH -DASH Now ,COMMA what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean ?QUESTIONMARK 
You need an AUV ,COMMA an autonomous underwater vehicle .PERIOD 
It needs to be one smart puppy ,COMMA able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean .PERIOD 
What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA I cut through three years of engineering meetings ,COMMA design and system integration ,COMMA and introduced DEPTHX -DASH -DASH Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer .PERIOD 
And as the movie says ,COMMA this is one smart puppy .PERIOD 
It's got <NUM> sensors ,COMMA <NUM> onboard computers ,COMMA <NUM> lines of behavioral autonomy code ,COMMA packs more than <NUM> kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent .PERIOD 
This is the target site ,COMMA the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico .PERIOD 
It's been explored to a depth of <NUM> meters and beyond that nobody knows anything .PERIOD 
This is part of DEPTHX's mission .PERIOD 
There are two primary targets we're doing here .PERIOD 
There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about ,COMMA but basically we drive through the space ,COMMA we populate it with environmental variables -DASH -DASH sulphide ,COMMA halide ,COMMA things like that .PERIOD 
We calculate gradient surfaces ,COMMA and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life .PERIOD 
We move along the wall ,COMMA in what's called proximity operations ,COMMA looking for changes in color .PERIOD 
If we see something that looks interesting ,COMMA we pull it into a microscope .PERIOD 
We either draw in a liquid sample ,COMMA or we can actually take a solid core from the wall .PERIOD 
The real hat trick for this vehicle ,COMMA though ,COMMA is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed ,COMMA known as 3D SLAM ,COMMA for simultaneous localization and mapping .PERIOD 
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball .PERIOD 
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time ,COMMA allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it's gone through already .PERIOD 
What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done .PERIOD 
This May ,COMMA we're going to go from minus <NUM> meters in Zacaton ,COMMA and if we're very lucky ,COMMA DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria .PERIOD 
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then ,COMMA if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go ,COMMA we could potentially launch by <NUM> ,COMMA and by <NUM> we may have the first evidence of life off this planet .PERIOD 
What then of manned space exploration ?QUESTIONMARK 
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by <NUM> .PERIOD 
The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots .PERIOD 
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime .PERIOD 
What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .PERIOD 
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here .PERIOD 
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately .PERIOD 
One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport .PERIOD 
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them .PERIOD 
Go ,COMMA go ,COMMA go .PERIOD 
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit .PERIOD 
Orbital hotels to start with ,COMMA but workshops for the rest of us later on .PERIOD 
The final missing piece ,COMMA the real paradigm-buster ,COMMA is this :COLON a gas station on orbit .PERIOD 
It's not going to look like that .PERIOD 
If it existed ,COMMA it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement ,COMMA I've got to give you the basics of Space <NUM> .PERIOD 
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram .PERIOD 
Anybody drink one of these here this week ?QUESTIONMARK 
You'd pay <NUM> dollars for that in orbit .PERIOD 
The second is more than <NUM> percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant .PERIOD 
Thus ,COMMA every time you'd want to do anything in space ,COMMA you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator .PERIOD 
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ?QUESTIONMARK 
In fact ,COMMA you can get it better -DASH -DASH you can get it at <NUM> times lower if you can find propellant on the moon .PERIOD 
There is a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon ,COMMA <NUM> years ago now ,COMMA called Clementine .PERIOD 
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon .PERIOD 
That signal was so strong ,COMMA it could only have been produced by <NUM> trillion tons of water buried in the sediment ,COMMA collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material .PERIOD 
We can't do that right now .PERIOD 
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground ,COMMA and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces .PERIOD 
We have to beat that .PERIOD 
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics .PERIOD 
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything .PERIOD 
This is an idea that ,COMMA again ,COMMA came out of Livermore back in <NUM> ,COMMA with Dr .PERIOD Lowell Wood's group .PERIOD 
And we can extend that now to just about everything .PERIOD 
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .PERIOD 
We can go much further .PERIOD 
We can build space tugs ,COMMA orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water .PERIOD 
There's another thing .PERIOD 
When you're coming back from the moon ,COMMA you have to deal with orbital mechanics .PERIOD 
It says you're moving <NUM> feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station .PERIOD 
You got two choices .PERIOD 
You can burn rocket fuel to get there ,COMMA or you can do something really incredible .PERIOD 
You can dive into the stratosphere ,COMMA and precisely dissipate that velocity ,COMMA and come back out to the space station .PERIOD 
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride -DASH -DASH better than Disney .PERIOD 
The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency .PERIOD 
If you try to do that for the moon ,COMMA you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there .PERIOD 
But if you send a mining team there ,COMMA without the return propellant ,COMMA first -DASH -DASH Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez ?QUESTIONMARK 
This is not like that .PERIOD I'm much more like Scotty .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA if you were truly bold you could get it there ,COMMA manufacture it ,COMMA and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done .PERIOD 
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and <NUM> years .PERIOD 
That's not true .PERIOD 
In seven years ,COMMA we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit .PERIOD 
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history .PERIOD 
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space .PERIOD 
The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration .PERIOD 
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .PERIOD 
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater ,COMMA to mine the moon for resources ,COMMA and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit .PERIOD 
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing .PERIOD 
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED .PERIOD 
I intend to lead that expedition .PERIOD 
It can be done in seven years with the right backing .PERIOD 
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who ,COMMA had they been here today ,COMMA would have heartily approved .PERIOD 
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier .PERIOD 
We have collectively forgotten that lesson .PERIOD 
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward .PERIOD 
<NUM> years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words ,COMMA I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier ,COMMA in our time ,COMMA for all of us .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
The Value of Nothing :COLON Out of Nothing Comes Something .PERIOD 
That was an essay I wrote when I was <NUM> years old and I got a B+ .PERIOD 
What I'm going to talk about :COLON nothing out of something ,COMMA and how we create .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I also want to explain ,COMMA because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie ,COMMA or not true to universal creativity .PERIOD 
And I've done it this way for half the audience ,COMMA who is scientific .PERIOD 
When I say we ,COMMA I don't mean you ,COMMA necessarily ;SEMICOLON I mean me ,COMMA and my right brain ,COMMA my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong .PERIOD 
And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process ,COMMA which includes a number of things that happened ,COMMA actually -DASH -DASH the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new .PERIOD 
And that includes nature ,COMMA and nurture ,COMMA and what I refer to as nightmares .PERIOD 
Now in the nature area ,COMMA we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something ,COMMA perhaps in our brains ,COMMA some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect .PERIOD 
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means .PERIOD 
And others ,COMMA like my mother ,COMMA would say that I get my material from past lives .PERIOD 
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -DASH -DASH van Gogh syndrome -DASH -DASH that you have a little bit of ,COMMA you know ,COMMA psychosis ,COMMA or depression .PERIOD 
I do have to say ,COMMA somebody -DASH -DASH I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic ,COMMA that he might have had temporal lobe seizures ,COMMA and that might have caused his spurt of creativity ,COMMA and I don't -DASH -DASH I suppose it does something in some part of your brain .PERIOD 
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago ,COMMA but it was during the time I was writing my last book ,COMMA and some people say that book is quite different .PERIOD 
And sometimes you're equipped with skills ,COMMA but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity .PERIOD 
And I had a miniature poodle .PERIOD 
And it wasn't bad ,COMMA but it wasn't really creative .PERIOD 
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way .PERIOD 
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA you look at those scores ,COMMA and it wasn't bad ,COMMA but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .PERIOD 
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had ,COMMA and that is that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA I had expectations placed on me .PERIOD 
That figure right there ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old ,COMMA and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age .PERIOD 
I have some ones that were long lasting :COLON from the age of five to <NUM> ,COMMA this was supposed to be my side occupation ,COMMA and it led to a sense of failure .PERIOD 
But actually ,COMMA there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about <NUM> .PERIOD 
And it was discovered that my brother ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA and then my father ,COMMA six months later ,COMMA had brain tumors .PERIOD 
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong ,COMMA and she was gonna find out what it was ,COMMA and she was gonna fix it .PERIOD 
My father was a Baptist minister ,COMMA and he believed in miracles ,COMMA and that God's will would take care of that .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA of course ,COMMA they ended up dying ,COMMA six months apart .PERIOD 
And after that ,COMMA my mother believed that it was fate ,COMMA or curses -DASH -DASH she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened .PERIOD 
Everything except randomness .PERIOD She did not believe in randomness .PERIOD 
There was a reason for everything .PERIOD 
And one of the reasons ,COMMA she thought ,COMMA was that her mother ,COMMA who had died when she was very young ,COMMA was angry at her .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA I had this notion of death all around me ,COMMA because my mother also believed that I would be next ,COMMA and she would be next .PERIOD 
You become very creative ,COMMA in a survival sense .PERIOD 
And this ,COMMA then ,COMMA led to my big questions .PERIOD 
And they're the same ones that I have today .PERIOD 
And they are :COLON why do things happen ,COMMA and how do things happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the one my mother asked :COLON how do I make things happen ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions ,COMMA when you write a story .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA after all ,COMMA in that framework ,COMMA between page one and <NUM> ,COMMA you have to answer this question of why things happen ,COMMA how things happen ,COMMA in what order they happen .PERIOD What are the influences ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do I ,COMMA as the narrator ,COMMA as the writer ,COMMA also influence that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it's also one that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA many of our scientists have been asking .PERIOD 
It's a kind of cosmology ,COMMA and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe ,COMMA as the creator of that universe .PERIOD 
And you see ,COMMA there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen ,COMMA trying to figure it out -DASH -DASH years and years ,COMMA oftentimes .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when I look at creativity ,COMMA I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress ,COMMA my looking at associations in practically anything in life .PERIOD 
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference ,COMMA almost everything that's been going on .PERIOD 
And so I'm going to use ,COMMA as the metaphor ,COMMA this association :COLON quantum mechanics ,COMMA which I really don't understand ,COMMA but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor .PERIOD 
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .PERIOD 
There's a lot of unknown ,COMMA and you often don't know what it is except by its absence .PERIOD 
But when you make those associations ,COMMA you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story ,COMMA and what you're finding is what matters .PERIOD The meaning .PERIOD 
There is also the uncertainty principle ,COMMA which is part of quantum mechanics ,COMMA as I understand it .PERIOD 
And this happens constantly in the writing .PERIOD 
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect ,COMMA in which you're looking for something ,COMMA and you know ,COMMA things are happening simultaneously ,COMMA and you're looking at it in a different way ,COMMA and you're trying to really look for the about-ness ,COMMA or what is this story about .PERIOD And if you try too hard ,COMMA then you will only write the about .PERIOD 
You won't discover anything .PERIOD 
And what you were supposed to find ,COMMA what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way ,COMMA is no longer there .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe ,COMMA like many of our scientists have .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA I am going to just throw in string theory here ,COMMA and just say that creative people are multidimensional ,COMMA and there are <NUM> levels ,COMMA I think ,COMMA of anxiety .PERIOD 
And they all operate at the same time .PERIOD 
There is also a big question of ambiguity .PERIOD 
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .PERIOD 
And you don't know what is operating ,COMMA but something is operating there .PERIOD 
And ambiguity ,COMMA to me ,COMMA is very uncomfortable in my life ,COMMA and I have it .PERIOD Moral ambiguity .PERIOD 
It is constantly there .PERIOD And ,COMMA just as an example ,COMMA this is one that recently came to me .PERIOD 
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq .PERIOD And she said ,COMMA Save a man from drowning ,COMMA you are responsible to him for life .PERIOD 
A very famous Chinese saying ,COMMA she said .PERIOD 
And that means because we went into Iraq ,COMMA we should stay there until things were solved .PERIOD You know ,COMMA maybe even <NUM> years .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there was another one that I came across ,COMMA and it's saving fish from drowning .PERIOD 
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say ,COMMA because they're not supposed to kill anything .PERIOD 
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning ,COMMA and unfortunately ,COMMA in the process the fish die .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -DASH -DASH actually ,COMMA one of them is my mother's interpretation ,COMMA and it is a famous Chinese saying ,COMMA because she said it to me :COLON save a man from drowning ,COMMA you are responsible to him for life .PERIOD 
And it was a warning -DASH -DASH don't get involved in other people's business ,COMMA or you're going to get stuck .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD I think if somebody really was drowning ,COMMA she'd save them .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA both of these sayings -DASH -DASH saving a fish from drowning ,COMMA or saving a man from drowning -DASH -DASH to me they had to do with intentions .PERIOD 
And all of us in life ,COMMA when we see a situation ,COMMA we have a response .PERIOD 
And then we have intentions .PERIOD 
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do ,COMMA and then we do something .PERIOD 
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .PERIOD 
Maybe things go wrong .PERIOD And so ,COMMA after that ,COMMA what are our responsibilities ?QUESTIONMARK 
What are we supposed to do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do we stay in for life ,COMMA or do we do something else and justify and say ,COMMA well ,COMMA my intentions were good ,COMMA and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it ?QUESTIONMARK 
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me ,COMMA and led me to write a book called Saving Fish From Drowning .PERIOD 
I saw examples of that .PERIOD Once I identified this question ,COMMA it was all over the place .PERIOD 
I got these hints everywhere .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA I knew that they had always been there .PERIOD 
And then writing ,COMMA that's what happens .PERIOD I get these hints ,COMMA these clues ,COMMA and I realize that they've been obvious ,COMMA and yet they have not been .PERIOD 
And what I need ,COMMA in effect ,COMMA is a focus .PERIOD 
And when I have the question ,COMMA it is a focus .PERIOD 
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question ,COMMA and what happens is those particular things become relevant .PERIOD 
And it seems like it's happening all the time .PERIOD 
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on ,COMMA a serendipity ,COMMA in which you're getting all this help from the universe .PERIOD 
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus .PERIOD 
And you are noticing it more often .PERIOD 
But you apply this .PERIOD 
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .PERIOD 
Your brother ,COMMA who's fallen in trouble ,COMMA do you take care of him ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why or why not ?QUESTIONMARK 
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said ,COMMA if I did ,COMMA it would show that I approved of the military regime there .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA after a while ,COMMA I had to ask myself ,COMMA Why do we take on knowledge ,COMMA why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up ,COMMA and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father ,COMMA who was a Baptist minister .PERIOD 
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions ,COMMA and still didn't know that if I went there ,COMMA what the result of that would be ,COMMA if I wrote a book -DASH -DASH and I just would have to face that later ,COMMA when the time came .PERIOD 
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .PERIOD 
We come to this point and say ,COMMA what do I as an individual do ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not all of us can go to Africa ,COMMA or work at hospitals ,COMMA so what do we do ,COMMA if we have this moral response ,COMMA this feeling ?QUESTIONMARK 
Also ,COMMA I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at ,COMMA and we talked about today ,COMMA is genocide .PERIOD 
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable ,COMMA and I consider what my intentions should be ,COMMA I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -DASH -DASH and why am I here ,COMMA and what is the meaning of my life ,COMMA and what is my place in the universe ?QUESTIONMARK 
It seems so obvious ,COMMA and yet it is not .PERIOD 
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense ,COMMA and yet it is also absolutely necessary .PERIOD 
In writing a story ,COMMA it is the place where I begin .PERIOD 
Sometimes I get help from the universe ,COMMA it seems .PERIOD 
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book ,COMMA because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know .PERIOD 
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally ,COMMA from an overdose of opium ,COMMA while having too much of a good time ,COMMA I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself ,COMMA and that actually was the way it happened .PERIOD 
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .PERIOD 
There are also things ,COMMA quite uncanny ,COMMA which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .PERIOD 
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .PERIOD 
And I took down this book ,COMMA and I -DASH -DASH first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting ,COMMA and the time period ,COMMA and the kind of character I needed -DASH -DASH was the Taiping rebellion ,COMMA happening in the area near Guilin ,COMMA outside of that ,COMMA and a character who thought he was the son of God .PERIOD 
You wonder ,COMMA are these things random chance ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA what is random ?QUESTIONMARK What is chance ?QUESTIONMARK What is luck ?QUESTIONMARK 
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain ?QUESTIONMARK 
And that goes into the story ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA again ,COMMA I think that when I am aware of them ,COMMA more of them happen .PERIOD 
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -DASH -DASH I just was with some friends ,COMMA and we drove randomly to a different place ,COMMA and we ended up in this non-tourist location ,COMMA a beautiful village ,COMMA pristine .PERIOD 
And we walked three valleys beyond ,COMMA and the third valley ,COMMA there was something quite mysterious and ominous ,COMMA a discomfort I felt .PERIOD And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book .PERIOD 
And in writing one of the scenes ,COMMA it happened in that third valley .PERIOD 
For some reason I wrote about cairns -DASH -DASH stacks of rocks -DASH -DASH that a man was building .PERIOD 
And I didn't know exactly why I had it ,COMMA but it was so vivid .PERIOD 
I got stuck ,COMMA and a friend ,COMMA when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs ,COMMA that I said ,COMMA sure .PERIOD And about <NUM> minutes later ,COMMA walking along the beach ,COMMA I came across this .PERIOD 
And it was a man ,COMMA a Chinese man ,COMMA and he was stacking these things ,COMMA not with glue ,COMMA not with anything .PERIOD 
And I asked him ,COMMA How is it possible to do this ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I guess with everything in life ,COMMA there's a place of balance .PERIOD 
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .PERIOD 
I had so many examples -DASH -DASH I have so many instances like this ,COMMA when I'm writing a story ,COMMA and I cannot explain it .PERIOD 
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain ,COMMA like the cosmological constant ?QUESTIONMARK 
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .PERIOD 
And as I said ,COMMA my mother did not believe in randomness .PERIOD 
What is the nature of accidents ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are ,COMMA outside of a court of law ?QUESTIONMARK 
I was able to see that in a firsthand way ,COMMA when I went to beautiful Dong village ,COMMA in Guizhou ,COMMA the poorest province of China .PERIOD 
And I saw this beautiful place .PERIOD I knew I wanted to come back .PERIOD 
And I had a chance to do that ,COMMA when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China .PERIOD 
And I said yes ,COMMA about this village of singing people ,COMMA singing minority .PERIOD 
And they agreed ,COMMA and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went ,COMMA there was a terrible accident .PERIOD A man ,COMMA an old man ,COMMA fell asleep ,COMMA and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm .PERIOD 
<NUM> homes were destroyed ,COMMA and <NUM> were damaged .PERIOD 
Responsibility was assigned to the family .PERIOD 
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away ,COMMA in a cowshed .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA as Westerners ,COMMA we say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA it was an accident .PERIOD That's not fair .PERIOD 
It's the son ,COMMA not the father .PERIOD 
When I go on a story ,COMMA I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs .PERIOD 
And so I was there on three occasions ,COMMA different seasons .PERIOD 
And I began to sense something different about the history ,COMMA and what had happened before ,COMMA and the nature of life in a very poor village ,COMMA and what you find as your joys ,COMMA and your rituals ,COMMA your traditions ,COMMA your links with other families .PERIOD And I saw how this had a kind of justice ,COMMA in its responsibility .PERIOD 
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using ,COMMA a ceremony they hadn't used in about <NUM> years .PERIOD And it was to send some men -DASH -DASH a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses .PERIOD 
Now you ,COMMA as Westerners ,COMMA and I ,COMMA as Westerners ,COMMA would say well ,COMMA that's superstition .PERIOD But after being there for a while ,COMMA and seeing the amazing things that happened ,COMMA you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world ,COMMA determining how things happen .PERIOD 
So I remained with them ,COMMA and the more I wrote that story ,COMMA the more I got into those beliefs ,COMMA and I think that's important for me -DASH -DASH to take on the beliefs ,COMMA because that is where the story is real ,COMMA and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life .PERIOD 
Years go by ,COMMA of course ,COMMA and the writing ,COMMA it doesn't happen instantly ,COMMA as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED .PERIOD 
The book comes and it goes .PERIOD When it arrives ,COMMA it is no longer my book .PERIOD 
It is in the hands of readers ,COMMA and they interpret it differently .PERIOD 
But I go back to this question of ,COMMA how do I create something out of nothing ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how do I create my own life ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I think it is by questioning ,COMMA and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths .PERIOD 
I believe in specifics ,COMMA the specifics of story ,COMMA and the past ,COMMA the specifics of that past ,COMMA and what is happening in the story at that point .PERIOD 
I also believe that in thinking about things -DASH -DASH my thinking about luck ,COMMA and fate ,COMMA and coincidences and accidents ,COMMA God's will ,COMMA and the synchrony of mysterious forces -DASH -DASH I will come to some notion of what that is ,COMMA how we create .PERIOD 
I have to think of my role .PERIOD Where I am in the universe ,COMMA and did somebody intend for me to be that way ,COMMA or is it just something I came up with ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I also can find that by imagining fully ,COMMA and becoming what is imagined -DASH -DASH and yet is in that real world ,COMMA the fictional world .PERIOD 
And that is how I find particles of truth ,COMMA not the absolute truth ,COMMA or the whole truth .PERIOD 
And they have to be in all possibilities ,COMMA including those I never considered before .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there are never complete answers .PERIOD 
Or rather ,COMMA if there is an answer ,COMMA it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything ,COMMA and that is good ,COMMA because then I will discover something new .PERIOD 
And if there is a partial answer ,COMMA a more complete answer from me ,COMMA it is to simply imagine .PERIOD 
And to imagine is to put myself in that story ,COMMA until there was only -DASH -DASH there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating .PERIOD 
And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -DASH -DASH in one story -DASH -DASH then I come the closest ,COMMA I think ,COMMA to knowing what compassion is ,COMMA to feeling that compassion .PERIOD 
Because for everything ,COMMA in that question of how things happen ,COMMA it has to do with the feeling .PERIOD 
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .PERIOD 
We've come to the end of the talk ,COMMA and I will reveal what is in the bag ,COMMA and it is the muse ,COMMA and it is the things that transform in our lives ,COMMA that are wonderful and stay with us .PERIOD 
There she is .PERIOD 
Thank you very much !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
I'm going to give you four specific examples -DASH -DASH and I'm going to cover at the end -DASH -DASH about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing ,COMMA how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact ,COMMA to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .PERIOD 
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years ,COMMA a record label I started that had a CD called Sauce .PERIOD 
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread ,COMMA and a guy named Otto Rohwedder .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said ?QUESTIONMARK 
Like the greatest invention since .. .PERIOD the telegraph or something .PERIOD 
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread ,COMMA and he focused ,COMMA like most inventors did ,COMMA on the patent part and the making part .PERIOD 
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -DASH -DASH that for the first <NUM> years after sliced bread was available no one bought it ;SEMICOLON no one knew about it ;SEMICOLON it was a complete and total failure .PERIOD 
That the success of sliced bread ,COMMA like the success of almost everything we've been talking about at this conference ,COMMA is not always about what the patent is like ,COMMA or what the factory is like -DASH -DASH it's about can you get your idea to spread ,COMMA or not .PERIOD 
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want ,COMMA or cause the change that you want to change ,COMMA to happen ,COMMA is that you've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread .PERIOD 
And it doesn't matter to me whether you're running a coffee shop or you're an intellectual ,COMMA or you're in business ,COMMA or you're flying hot air balloons .PERIOD 
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do .PERIOD 
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion .PERIOD 
That people who can spread ideas ,COMMA regardless of what those ideas are ,COMMA win .PERIOD 
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .PERIOD 
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV .PERIOD 
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .PERIOD 
I call it the TV-industrial complex .PERIOD 
The way the TV-industrial complex works ,COMMA is you buy some ads -DASH -DASH interrupt some people -DASH -DASH that gets you distribution .PERIOD 
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .PERIOD 
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .PERIOD 
And it goes around and around and around ,COMMA the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .PERIOD 
And that model of ,COMMA and we heard it yesterday ,COMMA if we could only get onto the homepage of Google ,COMMA if we could only figure out how to get promoted there ,COMMA if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat ,COMMA and tell them about what we want to do .PERIOD 
If we do that then everyone would pay attention ,COMMA and we would win .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting ,COMMA in a way they didn't necessarily want ,COMMA with an ad ,COMMA over and over and over again until they bought it .PERIOD 
And the thing that's happened is ,COMMA they canceled the TV-industrial complex .PERIOD 
That just over the last few years ,COMMA what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to .PERIOD 
This picture is really fuzzy ,COMMA I apologize ;SEMICOLON I had a bad cold when I took it .PERIOD 
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .PERIOD 
Right .PERIOD I go to the deli ;SEMICOLON I'm sick ;SEMICOLON I need to buy some medicine .PERIOD 
The brand manager for that blue product spent <NUM> million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year .PERIOD 
<NUM> million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -DASH -DASH all so I could ignore every single message .PERIOD 
And I'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem ,COMMA because I don't care .PERIOD 
Here's a magazine called Hydrate .PERIOD It's <NUM> pages about water .PERIOD 
Right .PERIOD Articles about water ,COMMA ads about water .PERIOD 
Imagine what the world was like <NUM> years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek .PERIOD 
Now there are magazines about water .PERIOD 
New products from Coke Japan -DASH -DASH water salad .PERIOD 
OK .PERIOD Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks ,COMMA because they have no idea what's going to work and what's not .PERIOD 
I couldn't have written this better myself .PERIOD It came out four days ago -DASH -DASH I circled the important parts so you can see them here .PERIOD 
They've come out .. .PERIOD Arby's is going to spend <NUM> million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold ,COMMA hoping that that will get people to go to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold ,COMMA that would get you to get in your car ,COMMA drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is Copernicus ,COMMA and he was right ,COMMA when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea .PERIOD 
The world revolves around me .PERIOD Me ,COMMA me ,COMMA me ,COMMA me ,COMMA me .PERIOD My favorite person -DASH -DASH me .PERIOD 
I don't want to get email from anybody ;SEMICOLON I want to get memail .PERIOD 
So consumers ,COMMA and I don't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway ;SEMICOLON I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something ,COMMA or people at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the New Yorker who might print your article .PERIOD 
Part of the reason is -DASH -DASH they've got way more choices than they used to ,COMMA and way less time .PERIOD 
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time ,COMMA the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff .PERIOD 
And my parable here is you're driving down the road and you see a cow ,COMMA and you keep driving because you've seen cows before .PERIOD 
Cows are invisible .PERIOD Cows are boring .PERIOD 
Who's going to stop and pull over and say -DASH -DASH oh ,COMMA look ,COMMA a cow .PERIOD Nobody .PERIOD 
But if the cow was purple -DASH -DASH isn't that a great special effect ?QUESTIONMARK 
I could do that again if you want it .PERIOD 
If the cow was purple ,COMMA you'd notice it for a while .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about ,COMMA what gets done ,COMMA what gets changed ,COMMA what gets purchased ,COMMA what gets built ,COMMA is :COLON is it remarkable ?QUESTIONMARK 
And remarkable is a really cool word because we think it just means neat ,COMMA but it also means -DASH -DASH worth making a remark about .PERIOD 
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .PERIOD 
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-dollar giant car ,COMMA big enough to hold a mini in its trunk .PERIOD 
People are paying full price for both ,COMMA and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common .PERIOD 
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .PERIOD 
It's never The Godfather ;SEMICOLON it's never Citizen Kane ;SEMICOLON it's always some third rate movie with some second rate star .PERIOD 
But the reason it's number one is because that's the week it came out .PERIOD 
Because it's new ,COMMA because it's fresh .PERIOD 
Two of the big success stories of the last <NUM> years in retail -DASH -DASH one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box ,COMMA and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .PERIOD 
The only thing they have in common is that they're different .PERIOD 
We're now in the fashion business ,COMMA no matter what we do for a living ,COMMA we're in the fashion business .PERIOD 
But it's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread ,COMMA and which ones don't .PERIOD 
This chair -DASH -DASH they sold a billion dollars' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair .PERIOD 
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought ,COMMA to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .PERIOD 
This guy ,COMMA Lionel Poilane ,COMMA the most famous baker in the world -DASH -DASH he died two and a half months ago ,COMMA and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend .PERIOD 
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned ,COMMA by one baker at a time ,COMMA in a wood-fired oven .PERIOD 
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .PERIOD 
They didn't want to buy his bread .PERIOD It didn't look like French bread .PERIOD 
It wasn't what they expected .PERIOD 
Now he's in London ,COMMA and he ships by FedEx all around the world .PERIOD 
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people .PERIOD 
That's what mass marketing is .PERIOD 
Smooth out the edges ;SEMICOLON go for the center ;SEMICOLON that's the big market .PERIOD 
It was all about going for the center .PERIOD 
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken ,COMMA I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more .PERIOD 
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they're really good at ignoring you .PERIOD 
But market to these people because they care .PERIOD 
These are the people who are obsessed with something .PERIOD 
And when you talk to them they'll listen because they like listening -DASH -DASH it's about them .PERIOD 
And if you're lucky ,COMMA they'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve ,COMMA and it'll spread .PERIOD 
It'll spread to the entire curve .PERIOD 
They have something I call otaku -DASH -DASH it's a great Japanese word .PERIOD 
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say ,COMMA drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place ,COMMA because that's what they do :COLON they get obsessed with it .PERIOD 
Instead ,COMMA you have to find a group that really ,COMMA desperately cares about what it is you have to say .PERIOD 
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .PERIOD 
There's a hot sauce otaku ,COMMA but there's no mustard otaku .PERIOD 
That's why there's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces ,COMMA and not so many kinds of mustard .PERIOD 
Not because it's hard to make interesting mustard -DASH -DASH you can make interesting mustard -DASH -DASH but people don't because no one's obsessed with it ,COMMA and thus no one tells their friends .PERIOD 
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .PERIOD 
This yoyo right here cost <NUM> dollars ,COMMA but it sleeps for <NUM> minutes .PERIOD 
Not everybody wants it but they don't care .PERIOD 
They want to talk to the people who do ,COMMA and maybe it'll spread .PERIOD 
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .PERIOD 
It's as loud as a <NUM> jet .PERIOD You can't get in the car ;SEMICOLON it's got bulletproof glass on the windows because they'll blow out the windshield otherwise .PERIOD 
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car ,COMMA if they've got the otaku or they've heard from someone who does ,COMMA they go ahead and they pick this .PERIOD 
It's really simple -DASH -DASH you sell to the people who are listening ,COMMA and maybe ,COMMA just maybe those people tell their friends .PERIOD 
So when Steve Jobs talks to <NUM> people at his keynote ,COMMA right ,COMMA who are all tuned in from <NUM> countries watching his two-hour commercial -DASH -DASH that's the only thing keeping his company in business -DASH -DASH is that those <NUM> people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial ,COMMA and then tell their friends .PERIOD 
Pearl Jam ,COMMA <NUM> albums released in the last two years .PERIOD 
Every one made a profit .PERIOD How ?QUESTIONMARK 
They only sell them on their website .PERIOD 
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku ,COMMA and then they tell their friends ,COMMA and it spreads and it spreads .PERIOD 
This hospital crib cost <NUM> dollars ,COMMA <NUM> times the standard .PERIOD 
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .PERIOD 
Hard Candy nail polish ,COMMA doesn't appeal to everybody ,COMMA but to the people who love it ,COMMA they talk about it like crazy .PERIOD 
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company ,COMMA making them a fortune .PERIOD It costs <NUM> percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about ,COMMA because it's remarkable .PERIOD 
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product ;SEMICOLON they changed what it meant to build a paint product .PERIOD 
AmIhotornot.com -DASH -DASH everyday <NUM> people go to this site ,COMMA run by two volunteers ,COMMA and I can tell you they are hard graders ,COMMA and they didn't get this way by advertising a lot .PERIOD 
They got this way by being remarkable ,COMMA sometimes a little too remarkable .PERIOD 
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back ,COMMA and you plug it into the wall .PERIOD 
My father has this on his desk ,COMMA and he sees his grandchildren everyday ,COMMA changing constantly .PERIOD 
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk .PERIOD 
And one person at a time ,COMMA the idea spreads .PERIOD 
These are not diamonds ,COMMA not really .PERIOD 
After you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .PERIOD 
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne -DASH -DASH you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this .PERIOD 
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them .PERIOD 
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .PERIOD 
Number two :COLON The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe .PERIOD 
Proctor and Gamble knows this ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people .PERIOD 
That's risky .PERIOD The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes ,COMMA be remarkable .PERIOD 
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do .PERIOD 
Very good is boring .PERIOD Very good is average .PERIOD 
It doesn't matter whether you're making a record album ,COMMA or you're an architect ,COMMA or you have a tract on sociology .PERIOD 
If it's very good ,COMMA it's not going to work ,COMMA because no one's going to notice it .PERIOD 
So my three stories .PERIOD 
Sales tripled .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Milk ,COMMA milk ,COMMA milk ,COMMA milk ,COMMA milk -DASH -DASH not milk .PERIOD 
They didn't triple their sales with advertising ;SEMICOLON they tripled it by doing something remarkable .PERIOD 
That is a remarkable piece of art .PERIOD You don't have to like it ,COMMA but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable .PERIOD 
Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum ;SEMICOLON he changed an entire city's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA at countless meetings at ,COMMA you know ,COMMA the Portland City Council ,COMMA or who knows where ,COMMA they said ,COMMA we need an architect -DASH -DASH can we get Frank Gehry ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because he did something that was at the fringes .PERIOD 
And my big failure ?QUESTIONMARK I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -DASH -DASH this remarkable new format -DASH -DASH and I marketed it straight to people with <NUM> ,COMMA 000-dollar stereos .PERIOD 
People with <NUM> ,COMMA 000-dollar stereos don't like new music .PERIOD 
So what you need to do is figure out who does care .PERIOD 
Who is going to raise their hand and say ,COMMA I want to hear what you're doing next ,COMMA and sell something to them .PERIOD 
The last example I want to give you .PERIOD 
This is a map of Soap Lake ,COMMA Washington .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA if that's nowhere ,COMMA it's in the middle of it .PERIOD 
But they do have a lake .PERIOD 
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake .PERIOD 
They don't anymore .PERIOD So the founding fathers said ,COMMA We've got some money to spend .PERIOD 
What can we build here ?QUESTIONMARK And like most committees ,COMMA they were going to build something pretty safe .PERIOD 
And then an artist came to them -DASH -DASH this is a true artist's rendering -DASH -DASH he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town .PERIOD 
That's a purple cow ;SEMICOLON that's something worth noticing .PERIOD 
I don't know about you but if they build it ,COMMA that's where I'm going to go .PERIOD 
Thank you very much for your attention .PERIOD 
I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine .PERIOD 
I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child .PERIOD 
And after even <NUM> years of doing this ,COMMA after <NUM> years of exploring the ocean ,COMMA I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea .PERIOD 
But more and more frequently these days I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well ,COMMA things that I don't think most people realize .PERIOD 
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story .PERIOD 
I want people to see what's happening underwater ,COMMA both the horror and the magic .PERIOD 
The first story that I did for National Geographic ,COMMA where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage ,COMMA was a story I proposed on harp seals .PERIOD 
The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St .PERIOD Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship ,COMMA mating and to have their pups .PERIOD 
And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide .PERIOD 
And because I'm an underwater photographer ,COMMA I wanted to do this story from both above and below ,COMMA to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water .PERIOD 
But as I got more involved in the story ,COMMA I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore .PERIOD 
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted ,COMMA killed with hakapiks at about eight ,COMMA <NUM> days old .PERIOD 
It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet ,COMMA with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year .PERIOD 
But as disturbing as that is ,COMMA I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming .PERIOD 
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St .PERIOD Lawrence during harp seal season .PERIOD 
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture ,COMMA there's a lot of water as well ,COMMA which wasn't there historically .PERIOD 
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms .PERIOD 
They only need <NUM> days from the moment they're born until they're on their own .PERIOD 
But if they don't get <NUM> days ,COMMA they can fall into the ocean and die .PERIOD 
This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old -DASH -DASH still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -DASH -DASH that has fallen in because of the thin ice ,COMMA and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase .PERIOD 
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there .PERIOD 
I read that last year the pup mortality rate was <NUM> percent in parts of the Gulf of St .PERIOD Lawrence .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA this species has a lot of problems going forward .PERIOD 
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic .PERIOD 
And it received quite a bit of attention .PERIOD 
And with that ,COMMA I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems .PERIOD 
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis ,COMMA in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last <NUM> years ,COMMA but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that <NUM> percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last <NUM> or <NUM> years .PERIOD 
When I read that ,COMMA I was blown away by those numbers .PERIOD 
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet ,COMMA but it really wasn't ,COMMA so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story .PERIOD 
I wanted it to be more like war photography ,COMMA where I was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .PERIOD 
The first component of the story that I thought was essential ,COMMA however ,COMMA was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA I think people go into a restaurant ,COMMA and somebody orders a steak ,COMMA and we all know where steak comes from ,COMMA and somebody orders a chicken ,COMMA and we know what a chicken is ,COMMA but when they're eating bluefin sushi ,COMMA do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming ?QUESTIONMARK 
These are the lions and tigers of the sea .PERIOD 
In reality ,COMMA these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ;SEMICOLON they're unique in the world .PERIOD 
These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year .PERIOD 
If we weren't so efficient at catching them ,COMMA because they grow their entire life ,COMMA would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton .PERIOD 
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago .PERIOD 
And every single day these tuna ,COMMA bluefin like this ,COMMA are stacked up like cordwood ,COMMA just warehouse after warehouse .PERIOD 
As I wandered around and made these pictures ,COMMA it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
We can't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .PERIOD 
I also ,COMMA with the story ,COMMA wanted to show readers how fish are caught ,COMMA some of the methods that are used to catch fish ,COMMA like a bottom trawler ,COMMA which is one of the most common methods in the world .PERIOD 
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp ,COMMA but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .PERIOD 
You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .PERIOD 
And as this assembly is towed through the water ,COMMA the doors meet resistance with the ocean ,COMMA and it opens the mouth of the net ,COMMA and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom .PERIOD 
And this just drags over the bottom ,COMMA in this case to catch shrimp .PERIOD 
But as you can imagine ,COMMA it's catching everything else in its path as well .PERIOD 
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom ,COMMA things like sponges and corals ,COMMA that critical habitat for other animals .PERIOD 
This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour .PERIOD 
So he had a handful of shrimp ,COMMA maybe seven or eight shrimp ,COMMA and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch .PERIOD 
These are animals that died in the process ,COMMA but have no commercial value .PERIOD 
And to make that point even more visual ,COMMA I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death ,COMMA you know ,COMMA animals like guitarfish ,COMMA bat rays ,COMMA flounder ,COMMA pufferfish ,COMMA that only an hour before ,COMMA were on the bottom of the ocean ,COMMA alive ,COMMA but now being thrown back as trash .PERIOD 
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net .PERIOD 
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible ,COMMA it struck me as sort of a crucifixion ,COMMA if you will .PERIOD 
This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic .PERIOD 
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of <NUM> million sharks .PERIOD 
And because I love sharks -DASH -DASH I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks -DASH -DASH I wanted to do another ,COMMA more celebratory ,COMMA story about sharks ,COMMA as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .PERIOD 
So I went to the Bahamas because there're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days ,COMMA but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy ,COMMA largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago .PERIOD 
And I wanted to show several species that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .PERIOD 
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .PERIOD 
But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters .PERIOD 
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary .PERIOD 
And with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet ,COMMA probably 14-feet ,COMMA I guess ,COMMA female tiger shark ,COMMA I sort of think I got to that goal ,COMMA where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose ,COMMA and my strobe created a shadow on her face .PERIOD 
And I think it's a gentler picture ,COMMA a little less threatening ,COMMA a little more respectful of the species .PERIOD 
It's a very solitary creature .PERIOD 
But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we know almost nothing about them .PERIOD 
We don't know where they migrate to or from ,COMMA where they mate ,COMMA where they have their pups ,COMMA and yet ,COMMA hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about <NUM> percent in the last <NUM> to <NUM> years .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them .PERIOD 
This is the oceanic whitetip shark ,COMMA an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species ,COMMA if you pay attention to such lists .PERIOD 
But it's an animal that's about <NUM> percent in decline throughout most of its range .PERIOD 
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water ,COMMA and because we weren't working on the bottom ,COMMA I brought along a shark cage here ,COMMA and my friend ,COMMA shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage .PERIOD 
You'll see that the photographer ,COMMA of course ,COMMA was not inside the cage here ,COMMA so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess .PERIOD 
And lastly with this story ,COMMA I also wanted to focus on baby sharks ,COMMA shark nurseries .PERIOD 
And I went to the island of Bimini ,COMMA in the Bahamas ,COMMA to work with lemon shark pups .PERIOD 
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup ,COMMA and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves .PERIOD 
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .PERIOD 
It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA here we see a shark that's maybe <NUM> or <NUM> inches long swimming in about a foot of water .PERIOD 
After I left Bimini ,COMMA I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .PERIOD 
And other recent stories have looked at single ,COMMA flagship species ,COMMA if you will ,COMMA that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats .PERIOD 
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle .PERIOD 
This is the largest ,COMMA widest-ranging ,COMMA deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species .PERIOD 
Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad .PERIOD 
These are animals whose lineage dates back about <NUM> million years .PERIOD 
And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by .PERIOD 
And today ,COMMA they crawl out and see condominiums .PERIOD 
But despite this amazing longevity ,COMMA they're now considered critically endangered .PERIOD 
In the Pacific ,COMMA where I made this photograph ,COMMA their stocks have declined about <NUM> percent in the last <NUM> years .PERIOD 
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey .PERIOD 
Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity .PERIOD 
But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore .PERIOD 
Nature has learned to compensate with that ,COMMA and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds .PERIOD 
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses ,COMMA human things ,COMMA like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net .PERIOD 
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale .PERIOD 
And essentially ,COMMA the story is this with right whales ,COMMA that about a million years ago ,COMMA there was one species of right whale on the planet ,COMMA but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated ,COMMA the species sort of separated ,COMMA and today we have essentially two distinct stocks .PERIOD 
We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers ,COMMA but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they're located in places farther away from human activity .PERIOD 
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ;SEMICOLON they live along the east coast of North America ,COMMA United States and Canada ,COMMA and they have to deal with all these urban ills .PERIOD 
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida .PERIOD 
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean ,COMMA and maybe even affecting their reproduction .PERIOD 
They also get entangled in fishing gear .PERIOD 
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale .PERIOD 
And those white markings are not natural markings .PERIOD 
These are entanglement scars .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of the population has such scars ,COMMA but most don't shed the gear ,COMMA things like lobster traps and crab pots .PERIOD 
They hold on to them ,COMMA and it eventually kills them .PERIOD 
And the other problem is they get hit by ships .PERIOD 
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia ,COMMA Canada being towed in ,COMMA where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death ,COMMA which was indeed a ship strike .PERIOD 
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low .PERIOD 
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population ,COMMA I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about <NUM> years ago in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand ,COMMA a place called the Auckland Islands .PERIOD 
And I got in the water with them ,COMMA and I was amazed at how curious they were .PERIOD 
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about <NUM> feet and one of these amazingly beautiful ,COMMA 45-foot ,COMMA 70-ton whales ,COMMA like a city bus just swimming up ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
They were in perfect condition ,COMMA very fat and healthy ,COMMA robust ,COMMA no entanglement scars ,COMMA the way they're supposed to look .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA I read that the pilgrims ,COMMA when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in <NUM> ,COMMA wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales .PERIOD 
And we can't go back and see that today ,COMMA but maybe we can preserve what we have left .PERIOD 
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope ,COMMA a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing ,COMMA the global fish crisis story .PERIOD 
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive ,COMMA and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean .PERIOD 
And I really wanted this story to be about three things :COLON I wanted it to be about abundance ,COMMA about diversity and about resilience .PERIOD 
And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand .PERIOD 
What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in <NUM> ,COMMA they hoped and expected that certain things might happen .PERIOD 
And they did come back .PERIOD What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen .PERIOD 
For example ,COMMA these fish predate on sea urchins ,COMMA and when the fish were all gone ,COMMA all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .PERIOD 
So when the fish control the urchin population ,COMMA the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA this is probably how the ocean looked here one or <NUM> years ago ,COMMA but nobody was around to tell us .PERIOD 
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well ,COMMA in beautiful ,COMMA fragile ,COMMA protected areas like in Fiordland ,COMMA where this sea pen colony was found .PERIOD 
In the northern part of New Zealand ,COMMA I dove in the blue water ,COMMA where the water's a little warmer ,COMMA and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon .PERIOD 
Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy ,COMMA from tiny ,COMMA little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .PERIOD 
And I wanted to finish with this photograph ,COMMA a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me .PERIOD 
And I was in a place that had only been protected about <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years ,COMMA and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s .PERIOD 
And that's because it's been protected ,COMMA that it has come back .PERIOD 
So I think the message is clear .PERIOD 
I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea ,COMMA and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it ,COMMA and I don't think it's too late .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I used to be a Malthusian .PERIOD 
This was my mental model of the world :COLON exploding population ,COMMA small planet ;SEMICOLON it's going to lead to ugly things .PERIOD 
Here's why .PERIOD 
This is the U.N.'s population data ,COMMA you may have seen ,COMMA for the world .PERIOD 
And after that ,COMMA most likely it's going to begin to decline .PERIOD 
So what then ?QUESTIONMARK 
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth .PERIOD 
So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation ,COMMA maybe depression .PERIOD 
But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects .PERIOD 
One :COLON fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet .PERIOD 
In the cities ,COMMA a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value .PERIOD 
Take away land speculation ,COMMA price of land drops .PERIOD 
And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor .PERIOD 
Number two :COLON a declining population means scarce labor .PERIOD 
Scarce labor drives wages .PERIOD 
As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class .PERIOD 
Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death .PERIOD 
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward ,COMMA romanticizing the past .PERIOD 
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden ,COMMA and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future .PERIOD 
So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days .PERIOD 
But I think we're in for another change ,COMMA about two generations after the top of that curve ,COMMA once the effects of a declining population start to settle in .PERIOD 
At that point ,COMMA we'll start romanticizing the future again ,COMMA instead of the nasty ,COMMA brutish past .PERIOD 
So why does this matter ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why talk about social-economic movements that may be more than a century away ?QUESTIONMARK 
When land owners start to lose money ,COMMA and labor demands more pay ,COMMA there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future .PERIOD 
If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn ,COMMA instead of careening off a cliff .PERIOD 
If we can make it through the next <NUM> years ,COMMA I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus .PERIOD 
And instead ,COMMA they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I've ever seen .PERIOD 
There was a very sick orangutan baby ,COMMA my first encounter .PERIOD 
That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard uhh ,COMMA uhh ,COMMA and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA the cage was salvaged .PERIOD 
I took up the little baby ,COMMA massaged her ,COMMA forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally .PERIOD 
This is Uce .PERIOD 
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain ,COMMA and this is Matahari ,COMMA her second son ,COMMA which ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued ,COMMA Dodoy .PERIOD 
That changed my life quite dramatically ,COMMA and as of today ,COMMA I have almost <NUM> babies in my two centers .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD No .PERIOD No .PERIOD Wrong .PERIOD 
It's horrible .PERIOD It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild .PERIOD 
It's not good .PERIOD 
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing .PERIOD 
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together ,COMMA just now like victims for every baby ,COMMA six have disappeared from the forest .PERIOD 
The deforestation ,COMMA especially for oil palm ,COMMA to provide biofuel for Western countries is what's causing these problems .PERIOD 
And those are the peat swamp forests on <NUM> meters of peat ,COMMA the largest accumulation of organic material in the world .PERIOD 
When you open this for growing oil palms you're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world ,COMMA after China and the United States .PERIOD 
And we don't have any industry at all -DASH -DASH it's only because of this deforestation .PERIOD 
And these are horrible images .PERIOD 
I'm not going to talk too long about it ,COMMA but there are so many of the family of Uce ,COMMA which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest ,COMMA that still have to go through that process .PERIOD 
And I don't know anymore where to put them .PERIOD 
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests ,COMMA to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing ,COMMA in that way ,COMMA the loss of habitat and all those victims .PERIOD 
So I created the place Samboja Lestari ,COMMA and the idea was ,COMMA if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left ,COMMA no one will have an excuse to say ,COMMA Yeah ,COMMA but .. .PERIOD 
No .PERIOD Everyone should be able to follow this .PERIOD 
As you can see there's only yellow terrain .PERIOD 
There's nothing left -DASH -DASH just a bit of grass there .PERIOD 
In <NUM> we had about <NUM> percent of the people jobless there .PERIOD 
There was a huge amount of crime .PERIOD 
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water .PERIOD 
There was no agricultural productivity left .PERIOD 
This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife .PERIOD 
This was like a biological desert .PERIOD 
When I stood there in the grass ,COMMA it's hot -DASH -DASH not even the sound of insects -DASH -DASH just this waving grass .PERIOD 
Still ,COMMA four years later we have created jobs for about <NUM> people .PERIOD 
The climate has changed .PERIOD I will show you :COLON no more flooding ,COMMA no more fires .PERIOD 
It's no longer the poorest district ,COMMA and there is a huge development of biodiversity .PERIOD 
We've got over <NUM> species .PERIOD We have <NUM> bird species as of today .PERIOD 
We have <NUM> species of reptiles .PERIOD 
So what happened here ?QUESTIONMARK We created a huge economic failure in this forest .PERIOD 
So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm .PERIOD 
But we saw the same thing .PERIOD 
We had slash and burn agriculture ;SEMICOLON people cannot afford the fertilizer ,COMMA so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there ;SEMICOLON the fires become more frequent ,COMMA and after a while you're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left .PERIOD 
There are no trees left .PERIOD 
Still ,COMMA in this place ,COMMA in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill ,COMMA four years later ,COMMA there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface .. .PERIOD 
And there are all these animals ,COMMA and all these people happy ,COMMA and there's this economic value .PERIOD 
So how's this possible ?QUESTIONMARK 
It was quite simple .PERIOD If you'll look at the steps :COLON we bought the land ,COMMA we dealt with the fire ,COMMA and then only ,COMMA we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry .PERIOD 
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary .PERIOD 
But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that .PERIOD 
The people would become the defenders of that forest .PERIOD 
So we do the people ,COMMA profit ,COMMA planet principles ,COMMA but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -DASH -DASH because if the forest belongs to the state ,COMMA people say ,COMMA It belongs to me ,COMMA it belongs to everyone .PERIOD 
And then we apply all these other principles like transparency ,COMMA professional management ,COMMA measurable results ,COMMA scalability ,COMMA [unclear] ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control ,COMMA whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice .PERIOD 
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out .PERIOD 
Now in this recipe you also have the cost .PERIOD 
You also know how much labor is needed .PERIOD 
If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil ,COMMA on a clay soil ,COMMA on a steep slope ,COMMA on flat soil ,COMMA you put those different recipes ;SEMICOLON if you combine them ,COMMA out of that comes a business plan ,COMMA comes a work plan ,COMMA and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have ,COMMA and you can do it .PERIOD 
This is how it looks like in practice .PERIOD We have this grass we want to get rid of .PERIOD 
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots .PERIOD 
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate ,COMMA to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses .PERIOD 
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -DASH -DASH that is ,COMMA if you can preserve it in the right way ,COMMA which we can do with bamboo peels .PERIOD 
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible .PERIOD 
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again .PERIOD 
So we plant it later ,COMMA along the waterways to filter the water ,COMMA provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available .PERIOD 
So the idea is :COLON how to integrate these flows in space ,COMMA over time and with the limited means you have .PERIOD 
So we plant the trees ,COMMA we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between ,COMMA to reduce the competition for the trees ,COMMA the crop fertilizer .PERIOD Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops ,COMMA for the people ,COMMA but also helps the trees .PERIOD The farmers have free land ,COMMA the system yields early income ,COMMA the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money .PERIOD 
So beautiful .PERIOD What a theory .PERIOD 
But is it really that easy ?QUESTIONMARK 
Not really ,COMMA because if you looked at what happened in <NUM> ,COMMA the fire started .PERIOD 
This is an area of about <NUM> million hectares .PERIOD 
January .PERIOD 
February .PERIOD 
March .PERIOD 
April .PERIOD 
May .PERIOD 
We lost <NUM> million hectares in just a matter of a few months .PERIOD 
This is because we have <NUM> of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States .PERIOD 
So how to break that cycle ?QUESTIONMARK 
Fire is the biggest problem .PERIOD 
For three months ,COMMA the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark .PERIOD 
So these fires are really the first things to work on .PERIOD 
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands ,COMMA once they start burning .. .PERIOD It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -DASH -DASH going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there .PERIOD 
So you have to do it with the local people .PERIOD 
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution .PERIOD 
So what we did is ,COMMA we created a ring of sugar palms around the area .PERIOD 
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -DASH -DASH also flood-resistant ,COMMA by the way -DASH -DASH and they provide a lot of income for local people .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like :COLON the people have to tap them twice a day -DASH -DASH just a millimeter slice -DASH -DASH and the only thing you harvest is sugar water ,COMMA carbon dioxide ,COMMA rain fall and a little bit of sunshine .PERIOD 
In principle ,COMMA you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells .PERIOD 
And you can create so much energy from this -DASH -DASH they produce three times more energy per hectare per year ,COMMA because you can tap them on a daily basis .PERIOD 
You don't need to harvest [unclear] or any other of the crops .PERIOD 
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics ,COMMA which is still unexploited ,COMMA and doing it in combination with technology .PERIOD 
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order .PERIOD 
So we bought that land ,COMMA and here is where we started our project -DASH -DASH in the middle of nowhere .PERIOD 
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil ,COMMA and we were actually monitoring ,COMMA measuring every single tree in these <NUM> hectares ,COMMA <NUM> acres .PERIOD 
And this forest is quite different .PERIOD 
What I really did was I just followed nature ,COMMA and nature doesn't know monocultures ,COMMA but a natural forest is multilayered .PERIOD 
That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light ,COMMA it can store more carbon in the system ,COMMA it can provide more functions .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA it's more complicated .PERIOD It's not that simple ,COMMA and you have to work with the people .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA just like nature ,COMMA we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that ,COMMA we grow the slower growing ,COMMA primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light .PERIOD Then ,COMMA what is just as important :COLON get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves ,COMMA bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
And they become like nutrient pumps .PERIOD 
And then we started planting -DASH -DASH only <NUM> trees a day .PERIOD 
We could have planted many ,COMMA many more ,COMMA but we didn't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable .PERIOD 
We didn't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation .PERIOD 
And we do a lot of work here .PERIOD 
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types ,COMMA or what vegetables will grow ,COMMA or what trees will grow here .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like in reality ;SEMICOLON you have this irregular ring around it ,COMMA with strips of <NUM> meters wide ,COMMA with sugar palms that can provide income for <NUM> families .PERIOD 
It's only a small part of the area .PERIOD 
The nursery ,COMMA in here ,COMMA is quite different .PERIOD 
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA from the Urals up to England ,COMMA you know how many ?QUESTIONMARK 
<NUM> .PERIOD 
In this nursery ,COMMA we're going to grow <NUM> times more than the number of species .PERIOD 
Can you imagine ?QUESTIONMARK 
You do need to know what you are working with ,COMMA but it's that diversity which makes it work .PERIOD 
That you can go from this zero situation ,COMMA by planting the vegetables and the trees ,COMMA or directly ,COMMA the trees in the lines in that grass there ,COMMA putting up the buffer zone ,COMMA producing your compost ,COMMA and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used .PERIOD 
And then slowly ,COMMA the trees start taking over ,COMMA bringing in produce from the fruits ,COMMA from the timber ,COMMA from the fuel wood .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income .PERIOD 
On the top left ,COMMA underneath those green stripes ,COMMA you see some white dots -DASH -DASH those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space .PERIOD 
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before .PERIOD 
So this is after one year .PERIOD 
And this is after two years .PERIOD 
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas ,COMMA the papayas ,COMMA all the crops for the local people ,COMMA but the trees are growing up fast in between as well .PERIOD 
And three years later ,COMMA <NUM> species of birds are living here .PERIOD 
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius .PERIOD 
Cloud cover -DASH -DASH I'm going to show it to you -DASH -DASH is up .PERIOD 
Rainfall is up .PERIOD 
And all these species and income .PERIOD 
This ecolodge that I built here ,COMMA three years before ,COMMA was an empty ,COMMA yellow field .PERIOD 
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -DASH -DASH it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture .PERIOD 
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon ,COMMA how the forest is developing ,COMMA and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation .PERIOD 
We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology .PERIOD 
We actually have it already with Google Earth .PERIOD 
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks ,COMMA and use Google Earth in combination with that ,COMMA you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced ,COMMA which company is stealing the timber ,COMMA and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here .PERIOD 
So this is the Samboja Lestari area .PERIOD 
You measure how the trees grow back ,COMMA but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back .PERIOD 
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced ,COMMA how many medicines can be kept here .PERIOD 
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain .PERIOD 
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water ;SEMICOLON it's <NUM> percent surrounded by seawater ,COMMA and we have now a lot of intrusion there .PERIOD 
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest ;SEMICOLON we looked at the reforestation area ,COMMA the semi-open area and the open area .PERIOD 
And look at these images .PERIOD 
I'll just run them very quickly through .PERIOD 
In the tropics ,COMMA raindrops are not formed from ice crystals ,COMMA which is the case in the temperate zones ,COMMA you need the trees with [unclear] ,COMMA chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops .PERIOD 
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate ,COMMA and you have the trees to initiate the rain .PERIOD 
And look ,COMMA there's now <NUM> percent more clouds -DASH -DASH already ,COMMA after three years .PERIOD 
If you look at rainfall ,COMMA it was already up <NUM> percent at that time .PERIOD 
Let's look at the next year ,COMMA and you can see that that trend is continuing .PERIOD 
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall ,COMMA that cap is now widening and getting higher .PERIOD 
And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari ,COMMA it used to be the driest place ,COMMA but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there .PERIOD 
So you can actually change the climate .PERIOD 
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears ,COMMA but afterwards ,COMMA as soon as the wind stabilizes ,COMMA you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area .PERIOD 
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do ,COMMA because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies .PERIOD 
And it's nice to have the science ,COMMA but it still depends mostly upon the people ,COMMA on your education .PERIOD 
We have our farmer schools .PERIOD 
But the real success of course ,COMMA is our band -DASH -DASH because if a baby is born ,COMMA we will play ,COMMA so everyone's our family and you don't make trouble with your family .PERIOD 
This is how it looks .PERIOD 
We have this road going around the area ,COMMA which brings the people electricity and water from our own area .PERIOD 
We have the zone with the sugar palms ,COMMA and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -DASH -DASH that we provide with a place to live in the middle -DASH -DASH and the people apart .PERIOD 
And inside ,COMMA we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive ,COMMA because for the last <NUM> years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared .PERIOD 
All the seeds get eaten .PERIOD 
So now we do the monitoring on the inside -DASH -DASH from towers ,COMMA satellites ,COMMA ultralights .PERIOD 
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -DASH -DASH you have the shade trees planted in year one ,COMMA then you underplanted with the sugar palms ,COMMA and you plant this thorny fence .PERIOD 
And after a few years ,COMMA you can remove some of those shade trees .PERIOD 
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel ,COMMA and they can build a house ,COMMA they have some fuel wood to cook with .PERIOD 
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like .PERIOD 
They have enough income for three families .PERIOD 
But whatever you do in that program ,COMMA it has to be fully supported by the people ,COMMA meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local ,COMMA cultural values .PERIOD 
There is no simple one recipe for one place .PERIOD 
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -DASH -DASH that it's transparent .PERIOD 
Like here ,COMMA in Samboja Lestari ,COMMA we divide that ring in groups of <NUM> families .PERIOD 
If the group doesn't take action ,COMMA the other <NUM> groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them .PERIOD 
In summary ,COMMA if you look at it ,COMMA in year one the people can sell their land to get income ,COMMA but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation ,COMMA the working with the orangutans ,COMMA and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft .PERIOD 
They also get free land in between the trees ,COMMA where they can grow their crops .PERIOD 
They get building material for houses ,COMMA a contract for selling the sugar ,COMMA so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally .PERIOD 
They get all these other benefits :COLON environmentally ,COMMA money ,COMMA they get education -DASH -DASH it's a great deal .PERIOD 
And everything is based upon that one thing -DASH -DASH make sure that forest remains there .PERIOD 
So if we want to help the orangutans -DASH -DASH what I actually set out to do -DASH -DASH we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit .PERIOD 
I hope -DASH -DASH if you want to know more ,COMMA you can read more .PERIOD 
I hope you'll understand my English .PERIOD 
In the mornings it is terrible ,COMMA and the afternoon is worst .PERIOD 
During many years ,COMMA I made some speeches starting with this saying :COLON City is not a problem ,COMMA it's a solution .PERIOD 
And more and more ,COMMA I'm convinced that it's not only a solution for a country ,COMMA but it's a solution for the problem of climate change .PERIOD 
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities .PERIOD 
I'm working in cities for almost <NUM> years ,COMMA and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big ,COMMA or the other mayors say ,COMMA We don't have financial resources ,COMMA I would like to say from the experience I had :COLON every city in the world can be improved in less than three years .PERIOD 
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility and also a design .PERIOD 
So to start ,COMMA I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers .PERIOD 
The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together .PERIOD 
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura ,COMMA and can we imagine ,COMMA if we cut the casque of the turtle ,COMMA how sad she's going to be ?QUESTIONMARK 
And that's what we're doing in our cities :COLON living here ,COMMA working here ,COMMA having leisure here .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the other character is Otto ,COMMA the automobile .PERIOD 
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking ,COMMA and he drinks a lot .PERIOD 
And he coughs a lot .PERIOD Very egotistical :COLON he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure .PERIOD 
Freeways .PERIOD 
And on the other hand ,COMMA Accordion ,COMMA the friendly bus ,COMMA he carries <NUM> people -DASH -DASH <NUM> in Sweden ;SEMICOLON <NUM> Brazilians .PERIOD 
Speaking about the design :COLON every city has its own design .PERIOD 
Curitiba ,COMMA my city :COLON three million in the metropolitan area ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> people in the city itself .PERIOD 
Curitiba ,COMMA Rio :COLON it's like two birds kissing themselves .PERIOD 
Oaxaca ,COMMA San Francisco -DASH -DASH it's very easy :COLON Market Street ,COMMA Van Ness and the waterfront .PERIOD 
And every city has its own design .PERIOD 
But to make it happen ,COMMA sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design -DASH -DASH an idea that everyone ,COMMA or the large majority ,COMMA will help you to make it happen .PERIOD 
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba .PERIOD 
And it's an example of living and working together .PERIOD 
And this is where we have more density ;SEMICOLON it's where we have more public transport .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this system started in '<NUM> .PERIOD We started with <NUM> passengers a day ,COMMA now it's <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> passengers a day .PERIOD 
And it took <NUM> years until another city .. .PERIOD 
which is Bogota ,COMMA and they did a very good job .PERIOD 
And now there's <NUM> cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba .PERIOD 
And one thing :COLON it's important not for only your own city ;SEMICOLON every city ,COMMA besides its normal problems ,COMMA they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity .PERIOD 
That means mostly two main issues -DASH -DASH mobility and sustainability -DASH -DASH are becoming very important for the cities .PERIOD 
And this is an articulated bus ,COMMA double-articulated .PERIOD 
And we are very close to my house .PERIOD 
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there .PERIOD 
And that's the evolution of the system .PERIOD 
What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes :COLON the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway .PERIOD 
That's why ,COMMA I'm trying to say ,COMMA it's like metro-nizing the bus .PERIOD 
This is the design of the bus ,COMMA and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding .PERIOD 
And for handicapped ,COMMA they can use this as a normal system .PERIOD 
What I'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars -DASH -DASH more than <NUM> percent -DASH -DASH so when we depend only on cars ,COMMA it's .. .PERIOD 
 -DASH -DASH that's why when we're talking about sustainability ,COMMA it's not enough ,COMMA green buildings .PERIOD 
It's not enough ,COMMA a new materials .PERIOD 
It's not enough ,COMMA new sources of energy .PERIOD 
It's the concept of the city ,COMMA the design of the city ,COMMA that's also important ,COMMA too .PERIOD And also ,COMMA how to teach the children .PERIOD 
I'll speak on this later on .PERIOD 
Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems .PERIOD 
We started in '<NUM> ,COMMA proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus .PERIOD 
The subway was against ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
And <NUM> years after ,COMMA they called us to develop -DASH -DASH we're developing this idea .PERIOD 
And you can understand how different it's going to be ,COMMA the image of Rio with the system -DASH -DASH one-minute frequency .PERIOD 
And it's not Shanghai ,COMMA it's not being colored during the day ,COMMA only at night it will look this way .PERIOD 
And before you say it's a Norman Foster design ,COMMA we designed this in '<NUM> .PERIOD 
And this is the model ,COMMA how it's going to work .PERIOD So ,COMMA it's the same system ;SEMICOLON the vehicle is different .PERIOD And that's the model .PERIOD 
What I'm trying to say is ,COMMA I'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better .PERIOD 
I'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems ,COMMA and with one condition :COLON never -DASH -DASH if you have a subway ,COMMA if you have surface systems ,COMMA if you have any kind of system -DASH -DASH never compete in the same space .PERIOD 
And coming back to the car ,COMMA I always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law :COLON you have to have good relationship with her ,COMMA but she cannot command your life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law ,COMMA you have a problem .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA all the ideas about how to transform through design -DASH -DASH old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -DASH -DASH all of it's related to how we teach the children .PERIOD 
And the children ,COMMA we teach during six months how to separate their garbage .PERIOD 
And after ,COMMA the children teach their parents .PERIOD 
And now we have <NUM> percent -DASH -DASH since <NUM> years ,COMMA it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world .PERIOD 
Seven zero .PERIOD 
So teach the children .PERIOD 
I would like to say ,COMMA if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what's said ,COMMA but don't forget the cities and the children .PERIOD 
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city ,COMMA because you cannot have empty places during <NUM> hours a day .PERIOD 
You should have always a structure of living and working together .PERIOD 
Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
Another issue is ,COMMA a city's like our family portrait .PERIOD 
We don't rip our family portrait ,COMMA even if we don't like the nose of our uncle ,COMMA because this portrait is you .PERIOD 
And these are the references that we have in any city .PERIOD 
This is the main pedestrian mall ;SEMICOLON we did it in <NUM> hours .PERIOD Yes ,COMMA you have to be fast .PERIOD 
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution .PERIOD 
This is the Italian portal ,COMMA the Ukrainian park ,COMMA the Polish park ,COMMA the Japanese square ,COMMA the German park .PERIOD 
All of a sudden ,COMMA the Soviet Union ,COMMA they split .PERIOD 
And since we have people from Uzbekistan ,COMMA Kazakhstan ,COMMA Tajikistan ,COMMA [unclear] ,COMMA we have to stop the program .PERIOD 
Don't forget :COLON creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget .PERIOD 
If you cut two zeros ,COMMA it's much better .PERIOD 
And this is the Wire Opera theater .PERIOD We did it in two months .PERIOD 
Quarries once made the nature ,COMMA and sometimes we took this and we transformed .PERIOD 
And every part can be transformed ;SEMICOLON every frog can be transformed in a prince .PERIOD 
Planning takes time .PERIOD And I'm proposing urban acupuncture .PERIOD 
That means me ,COMMA with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning .PERIOD 
And this is an acupuncture note -DASH -DASH or I.M .PERIOD Pei's .PERIOD Some small ones can make the city better .PERIOD 
The smallest park in New York ,COMMA the most beautiful :COLON <NUM> meters .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -DASH -DASH new sustainable materials -DASH -DASH but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end ,COMMA because we don't have the whole time to plan .PERIOD 
And I think creativity ,COMMA innovation is starting .PERIOD 
So when you start -DASH -DASH and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers -DASH -DASH it's important starting and having the contribution from people ,COMMA and they could teach you if you're not in the right track .PERIOD 
At the end ,COMMA I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song .PERIOD 
OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
Please ,COMMA allow me just two minutes .PERIOD 
You're going to make the music and the rhythm .PERIOD

I was here four years ago ,COMMA and I remember ,COMMA at the time ,COMMA that the talks weren't put online .PERIOD 
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box ,COMMA a box set of DVDs ,COMMA which they put on their shelves ,COMMA where they are now .PERIOD 
And actually ,COMMA Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk and he said ,COMMA We're going to start putting them online .PERIOD 
Can we put yours online ?QUESTIONMARK And I said ,COMMA Sure .PERIOD 
And four years later ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA it's been seen by four .. .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it's been downloaded four million times .PERIOD 
So I suppose you could multiply that by <NUM> or something to get the number of people who've seen it .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA as Chris says ,COMMA there is a hunger for videos of me .PERIOD 
.. .PERIOD don't you feel ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you ,COMMA so here it is .PERIOD 
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .PERIOD 
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk .PERIOD 
So I want to pick up from there because I only had <NUM> minutes ,COMMA frankly .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as I was saying.. .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA there is a major climate crisis ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA and I think if people don't believe it ,COMMA they should get out more .PERIOD 
But I believe there's a second climate crisis ,COMMA which is as severe ,COMMA which has the same origins ,COMMA and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .PERIOD 
And I mean by this -DASH -DASH and you may say ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA Look ,COMMA I'm good .PERIOD 
I have one climate crisis ;SEMICOLON I don't really need the second one .PERIOD 
But this is a crisis of ,COMMA not natural resources -DASH -DASH though I believe that's true -DASH -DASH but a crisis of human resources .PERIOD 
I believe fundamentally ,COMMA as many speakers have said during the past few days ,COMMA that we make very poor use of our talents .PERIOD 
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be ,COMMA or if they have any to speak of .PERIOD 
I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything .PERIOD 
Actually ,COMMA I kind of divide the world into two groups now .PERIOD 
Jeremy Bentham ,COMMA the great utilitarian philosopher ,COMMA once spiked this argument .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I do .PERIOD 
I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do .PERIOD 
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .PERIOD 
They get no great pleasure from what they do .PERIOD 
They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend .PERIOD 
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else .PERIOD 
Because it isn't what they do ,COMMA it's who they are .PERIOD They say ,COMMA But this is me ,COMMA you know .PERIOD 
It would be foolish for me to abandon this ,COMMA because it speaks to my most authentic self .PERIOD 
And it's not true of enough people .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA on the contrary ,COMMA I think it's still true of a minority of people .PERIOD 
I think there are many possible explanations for it .PERIOD 
And high among them is education ,COMMA because education ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA dislocates very many people from their natural talents .PERIOD 
And human resources are like natural resources ;SEMICOLON they're often buried deep .PERIOD 
You have to go looking for them ,COMMA they're not just lying around on the surface .PERIOD 
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens ,COMMA but too often it's not .PERIOD 
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough .PERIOD 
Reform is no use anymore ,COMMA because that's simply improving a broken model .PERIOD 
What we need -DASH -DASH and the word's been used many times during the course of the past few days -DASH -DASH is not evolution ,COMMA but a revolution in education .PERIOD 
This has to be transformed into something else .PERIOD 
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .PERIOD 
Innovation is hard because it means doing something that people don't find very easy ,COMMA for the most part .PERIOD 
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense ;SEMICOLON things that people think ,COMMA Well ,COMMA it can't be done any other way because that's the way it's done .PERIOD 
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln ,COMMA who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point .PERIOD 
We don't teach American history in Britain .PERIOD 
We suppress it .PERIOD You know ,COMMA this is our policy .PERIOD 
But he said this :COLON The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present .PERIOD 
The occasion is piled high with difficulty ,COMMA and we must rise with the occasion .PERIOD 
I love that .PERIOD 
Not rise to it ,COMMA rise with it .PERIOD 
As our case is new ,COMMA so we must think anew and act anew .PERIOD 
We must disenthrall ourselves ,COMMA and then we shall save our country .PERIOD 
I love that word ,COMMA disenthrall .PERIOD 
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to ,COMMA which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things ,COMMA the way things are .PERIOD 
And many of our ideas have been formed ,COMMA not to meet the circumstances of this century ,COMMA but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA doing this is easier said than done .PERIOD 
It's very hard to know ,COMMA by the way ,COMMA what it is you take for granted .PERIOD 
And the reason is that you take it for granted .PERIOD 
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .PERIOD 
How many of you here are over the age of <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's not what I think you take for granted ,COMMA I'm sure you're familiar with that already .PERIOD 
Are there any people here under the age of <NUM> ?QUESTIONMARK 
Great .PERIOD Now ,COMMA those over <NUM> ,COMMA could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now that's a great deal of us ,COMMA isn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .PERIOD 
I don't mean they can't or they're not allowed to ,COMMA they just often choose not to .PERIOD 
And the reason is ,COMMA you see ,COMMA that we were brought up in a pre-digital culture ,COMMA those of us over <NUM> .PERIOD 
And so for us ,COMMA if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it .PERIOD 
Kids now live in a world which is digitized ,COMMA and the time ,COMMA for them ,COMMA is everywhere .PERIOD 
They see no reason to do this .PERIOD 
And by the way ,COMMA you don't need to do it either ;SEMICOLON it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it .PERIOD 
My daughter never wears a watch ,COMMA my daughter Kate ,COMMA who's <NUM> .PERIOD 
As she says ,COMMA It's a single function device .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA how lame is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I say ,COMMA No ,COMMA no ,COMMA it tells the date as well .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you see ,COMMA there are things we're enthralled to in education .PERIOD 
Let me give you a couple of examples .PERIOD 
One of them is the idea of linearity :COLON that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right ,COMMA you will end up set for the rest of your life .PERIOD 
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have become obsessed with this linear narrative .PERIOD 
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college .PERIOD 
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .PERIOD 
Certain sorts of college .PERIOD 
Maybe they go later ,COMMA not right away .PERIOD 
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing .PERIOD 
There was this guy buying a book ,COMMA he was in his 30s .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA What do you do ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA I'm a fireman .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA How long have you been a fireman ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA Always .PERIOD I've always been a fireman .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA when did you decide ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA As a kid .PERIOD He said ,COMMA Actually ,COMMA it was a problem for me at school ,COMMA because at school ,COMMA everybody wanted to be a fireman .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA But I wanted to be a fireman .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA When I got to the senior year of school ,COMMA my teachers didn't take it seriously .PERIOD 
This one teacher didn't take it seriously .PERIOD 
He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it ;SEMICOLON that I should go to college ,COMMA I should become a professional person ,COMMA that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful .PERIOD 
But it's what I wanted ,COMMA and as soon as I left school ,COMMA I applied to the fire service and I was accepted .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA I was thinking about that guy recently ,COMMA just a few minutes ago when you were speaking ,COMMA about this teacher ,COMMA he said ,COMMA because six months ago ,COMMA I saved his life .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA He was in a car wreck ,COMMA and I pulled him out ,COMMA gave him CPR ,COMMA and I saved his wife's life as well .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA I think he thinks better of me now .PERIOD 
And at the heart of our challenges -DASH -DASH At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence .PERIOD 
This linearity thing is a problem .PERIOD 
When I arrived in L.A .PERIOD 
about nine years ago ,COMMA I came across a policy statement -DASH -DASH very well-intentioned -DASH -DASH which said ,COMMA College begins in kindergarten .PERIOD 
No ,COMMA it doesn't .PERIOD 
It doesn't .PERIOD 
If we had time ,COMMA I could go into this ,COMMA but we don't .PERIOD 
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .PERIOD 
A friend of mine once said ,COMMA You know ,COMMA a three year-old is not half a six year-old .PERIOD 
They're three .PERIOD 
But as we just heard in this last session ,COMMA there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -DASH -DASH to get to the right kindergarten -DASH -DASH that people are being interviewed for it at three .PERIOD 
You've been around for <NUM> months ,COMMA and this is it ?QUESTIONMARK 
You've achieved nothing -DASH -DASH commit .PERIOD 
Spent the first six months breastfeeding ,COMMA the way I can see it .PERIOD 
See ,COMMA it's outrageous as a conception ,COMMA but it [unclear] .PERIOD 
The other big issue is conformity .PERIOD 
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food .PERIOD 
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .PERIOD 
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .PERIOD 
One is fast food ,COMMA where everything is standardized .PERIOD 
The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants ,COMMA where everything is not standardized ,COMMA they're customized to local circumstances .PERIOD 
And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education ,COMMA and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies .PERIOD 
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .PERIOD 
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .PERIOD 
People have very different aptitudes .PERIOD 
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it worked out for Eric ,COMMA that's all I'm saying .PERIOD 
In a way ,COMMA it did not for me .PERIOD 
I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it .PERIOD 
It just wouldn't work .PERIOD 
But it's not only about that .PERIOD 
It's about passion .PERIOD 
Often ,COMMA people are good at things they don't really care for .PERIOD 
It's about passion ,COMMA and what excites our spirit and our energy .PERIOD 
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do ,COMMA that you're good at ,COMMA time takes a different course entirely .PERIOD 
My wife's just finished writing a novel ,COMMA and I think it's a great book ,COMMA but she disappears for hours on end .PERIOD 
You know this ,COMMA if you're doing something you love ,COMMA an hour feels like five minutes .PERIOD 
If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit ,COMMA five minutes feels like an hour .PERIOD 
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit ,COMMA it doesn't feed their energy or their passion .PERIOD 
So I think we have to change metaphors .PERIOD 
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education ,COMMA a manufacturing model ,COMMA which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people .PERIOD 
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .PERIOD 
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ;SEMICOLON it's an organic process .PERIOD 
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .PERIOD 
All you can do ,COMMA like a farmer ,COMMA is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish .PERIOD 
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it ,COMMA it isn't like cloning a system .PERIOD 
There are great ones ,COMMA like KIPP's ;SEMICOLON it's a great system .PERIOD 
There are many great models .PERIOD 
It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching .PERIOD 
And doing that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution ;SEMICOLON it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions ,COMMA but with external support based on a personalized curriculum .PERIOD 
Now in this room ,COMMA there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business ,COMMA in multimedia ,COMMA in the Internet .PERIOD 
These technologies ,COMMA combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers ,COMMA provide an opportunity to revolutionize education .PERIOD 
And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital ,COMMA not just to ourselves ,COMMA but to the future of our children .PERIOD 
But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model ,COMMA where each school can be flourishing tomorrow .PERIOD 
That's where children experience life .PERIOD 
Or at home ,COMMA if that's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends .PERIOD 
There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days .PERIOD 
And I wanted to just very quickly .. .PERIOD 
I wanted to read you a quick ,COMMA very short poem from W .PERIOD B .PERIOD Yeats ,COMMA who some of you may know .PERIOD 
He wrote this to his love ,COMMA Maud Gonne ,COMMA and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him .PERIOD 
And he says ,COMMA I've got something else ,COMMA but it may not be for you .PERIOD 
He says this :COLON Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths ,COMMA Enwrought with gold and silver light ,COMMA The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light ,COMMA I would spread the cloths under your feet :COLON But I ,COMMA being poor ,COMMA have only my dreams ;SEMICOLON I have spread my dreams under your feet ;SEMICOLON Tread softly because you tread on my dreams .PERIOD 
And every day ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA our children spread their dreams beneath our feet .PERIOD 
And we should tread softly .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Believe me or not ,COMMA I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem ,COMMA with the requisite focus on climate .PERIOD 
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind ,COMMA and the resulting decline of the biosphere .PERIOD 
That culprit is business and industry ,COMMA which happens to be where I have spent the last <NUM> years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in <NUM> .PERIOD 
As an industrial engineer ,COMMA cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur .PERIOD 
After founding my company ,COMMA Interface ,COMMA from scratch in <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago ,COMMA to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets ,COMMA and shepherding it through start-up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field ,COMMA I read Paul Hawken's book ,COMMA The Ecology of Commerce ,COMMA the summer of <NUM> .PERIOD 
In his book ,COMMA Paul charges business and industry as ,COMMA one ,COMMA the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere ,COMMA and ,COMMA two ,COMMA the only institution that is large enough ,COMMA and pervasive enough ,COMMA and powerful enough ,COMMA to really lead humankind out of this mess .PERIOD 
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth .PERIOD 
And I then challenged the people of Interface ,COMMA my company ,COMMA to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability ,COMMA which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum-intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth ,COMMA naturally and rapidly -DASH -DASH not another fresh drop of oil -DASH -DASH and to do no harm to the biosphere .PERIOD 
Take nothing :COLON do no harm .PERIOD 
I simply said ,COMMA If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead ,COMMA who will lead business and industry ?QUESTIONMARK 
Unless somebody leads ,COMMA nobody will .PERIOD 
And thanks to the people of Interface ,COMMA I have become a recovering plunderer .PERIOD 
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .PERIOD 
And that became the headline of a Fortune article .PERIOD 
From plunderer to recovering plunderer ,COMMA to America's greenest CEO in five years -DASH -DASH that ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Asked later in the Canadian documentary ,COMMA The Corporation ,COMMA what I meant by the go to jail remark ,COMMA I offered that theft is a crime .PERIOD 
But I realized ,COMMA for that to be true -DASH -DASH for theft of our children's future to be a crime -DASH -DASH there must be a clear ,COMMA demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization ,COMMA and is the major culprit ,COMMA stealing our children's future ,COMMA by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -DASH -DASH in short ,COMMA digging up the earth and converting it to pollution .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA impact is generated by people ,COMMA what they consume in their affluence ,COMMA and how it is produced .PERIOD 
And though the equation is largely subjective ,COMMA you can perhaps quantify people ,COMMA and perhaps quantify affluence ,COMMA but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify .PERIOD 
So the equation is conceptual .PERIOD 
Still it works to help us understand the problem .PERIOD 
So we set out at Interface ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA to create an example :COLON to transform the way we made carpet ,COMMA a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy ,COMMA and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact ,COMMA rather than multiplied it .PERIOD 
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the mathematically-minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -DASH -DASH a bad thing -DASH -DASH but T in the denominator decreases impact .PERIOD 
So I ask ,COMMA What would move T ,COMMA technology ,COMMA from the numerator -DASH -DASH call it T1 -DASH -DASH where it increases impact ,COMMA to the denominator -DASH -DASH call it T2 -DASH -DASH where it reduces impact ?QUESTIONMARK 
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution ,COMMA T1 ,COMMA as we practiced it at Interface ,COMMA and it had the following characteristics .PERIOD 
Extractive :COLON taking raw materials from the earth .PERIOD 
Linear :COLON take ,COMMA make ,COMMA waste .PERIOD 
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy .PERIOD 
Wasteful :COLON abusive and focused on labor productivity .PERIOD 
More carpet per man-hour .PERIOD 
Thinking it through ,COMMA I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator .PERIOD 
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ;SEMICOLON linear by cyclical ;SEMICOLON fossil fuel energy by renewable energy ,COMMA sunlight ;SEMICOLON wasteful by waste-free ;SEMICOLON and abusive by benign ;SEMICOLON and labor productivity by resource productivity .PERIOD 
And that became the Interface plan in <NUM> ,COMMA and has been the plan ever since .PERIOD 
We have measured our progress very rigorously .PERIOD 
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing <NUM> years .PERIOD 
Net greenhouse gas emissions down <NUM> percent in absolute tonnage .PERIOD 
Over the same span of time sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled .PERIOD 
So an <NUM> percent absolute reduction translates into a <NUM> percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales .PERIOD 
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by <NUM> to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -DASH -DASH so the scientists are telling us .PERIOD 
The cheapest ,COMMA most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies .PERIOD 
Water usage is down <NUM> percent in our worldwide carpet tile business .PERIOD 
Renewable or recyclable materials are <NUM> percent of the total ,COMMA and growing rapidly .PERIOD 
Renewable energy is <NUM> percent of our total ,COMMA going for <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold <NUM> million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since <NUM> ,COMMA meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain ,COMMA from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -DASH -DASH independent third-party certified .PERIOD 
We call it Cool Carpet .PERIOD 
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator ,COMMA increasing sales and profits .PERIOD 
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home ,COMMA under the brand Flor ,COMMA misspelled F-L-O-R .PERIOD 
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days .PERIOD 
It is practical ,COMMA and pretty too .PERIOD 
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal :COLON zero impact ,COMMA zero footprint .PERIOD 
We've set <NUM> as our target year for zero ,COMMA for reaching the top ,COMMA the summit of Mount Sustainability .PERIOD 
We call this Mission Zero .PERIOD 
And this is perhaps the most important facet :COLON we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business .PERIOD 
A better business model ,COMMA a better way to bigger profits .PERIOD 
Here is the business case for sustainability .PERIOD 
From real life experience ,COMMA costs are down ,COMMA not up ,COMMA reflecting some <NUM> million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste -DASH -DASH the first face of Mount Sustainability .PERIOD 
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface .PERIOD 
And this dispels a myth too ,COMMA this false choice between the environment and the economy .PERIOD 
Our products are the best they've ever been ,COMMA inspired by design for sustainability ,COMMA an unexpected wellspring of innovation .PERIOD 
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose .PERIOD 
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together .PERIOD 
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing .PERIOD 
No amount of advertising ,COMMA no clever marketing campaign ,COMMA at any price ,COMMA could have produced or created this much goodwill .PERIOD 
It is a better business model .PERIOD 
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits .PERIOD 
There is a dip there ,COMMA from <NUM> to <NUM> :COLON a dip when our sales ,COMMA over a three-year period ,COMMA were down <NUM> percent .PERIOD 
We literally gained market share .PERIOD 
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability .PERIOD 
If every business were pursuing Interface plans ,COMMA would that solve all our problems ?QUESTIONMARK 
I don't think so .PERIOD 
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation ,COMMA I equals P times A divided by T2 .PERIOD 
That A is a capital A ,COMMA suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .PERIOD 
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ?QUESTIONMARK 
And what if we made A a lowercase 'a ,COMMA ' suggesting that it is a means to an end ,COMMA and that end is happiness -DASH -DASH more happiness with less stuff .PERIOD 
You know that would reframe civilization itself -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH and our whole system of economics ,COMMA if not for our species ,COMMA then perhaps for the one that succeeds us :COLON the sustainable species ,COMMA living on a finite earth ,COMMA ethically ,COMMA happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations ,COMMA or <NUM> generations -DASH -DASH that is to say ,COMMA into the indefinite future .PERIOD 
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well maybe so .PERIOD But I don't think so .PERIOD 
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable ,COMMA zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence by <NUM> .PERIOD 
And now the challenge is in execution .PERIOD 
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says ,COMMA If something exists ,COMMA it must be possible .PERIOD 
If we can actually do it ,COMMA it must be possible .PERIOD 
If we ,COMMA a petro-intensive company can do it ,COMMA anybody can .PERIOD 
And if anybody can ,COMMA it follows that everybody can .PERIOD 
Hawken fulfilled business and industry ,COMMA leading humankind away from the abyss because ,COMMA with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere ,COMMA a very dear person is at risk here -DASH -DASH frankly ,COMMA an unacceptable risk .PERIOD 
Not you .PERIOD Not I .PERIOD 
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here .PERIOD 
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb .PERIOD 
On a Tuesday morning in March of <NUM> ,COMMA I was talking to people ,COMMA as I did at every opportunity back then ,COMMA bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting .PERIOD 
But about five days later back in Atlanta ,COMMA I received an email from Glenn Thomas ,COMMA one of my people in the California meeting .PERIOD 
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together .PERIOD 
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life .PERIOD 
Because it told me ,COMMA by God ,COMMA one person got it .PERIOD 
Here is what Glenn wrote .PERIOD And here is that person ,COMMA most at risk .PERIOD 
Please meet Tomorrow's Child .PERIOD 
Without a name ,COMMA an unseen face ,COMMA and knowing not your time or place ,COMMA Tomorrow's child ,COMMA though yet unborn ,COMMA I met you first last Tuesday morn .PERIOD 
A wise friend introduced us two .PERIOD 
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see ,COMMA a day for you but not for me .PERIOD 
Knowing you has changed my thinking .PERIOD 
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday ,COMMA somehow threaten you .PERIOD 
Tomorrow's child ,COMMA my daughter ,COMMA son ,COMMA I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good ,COMMA though always having known I should .PERIOD 
Begin ,COMMA I will .PERIOD 
The way the cost of what I squander ,COMMA what is lost ,COMMA if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA every day of my life since ,COMMA Tomorrow's Child has spoken to me with one simple but profound message ,COMMA which I presume to share with you .PERIOD 
We are ,COMMA each and every one ,COMMA a part of the web of life .PERIOD 
The continuum of humanity ,COMMA sure ,COMMA but in a larger sense ,COMMA the web of life itself .PERIOD 
And we have a choice to make during our brief ,COMMA brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet :COLON to hurt it or to help it .PERIOD 
For you ,COMMA it's your call .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I am a cultural omnivore ,COMMA one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod -DASH -DASH an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart ,COMMA pop diva Christina Aguilera ,COMMA country singer Josh Turner ,COMMA gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin ,COMMA concerti ,COMMA symphonies and more and more .PERIOD 
I'm a voracious reader ,COMMA a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer .PERIOD 
I have read the Twilight tetralogy .PERIOD 
And one who lives for my home theater ,COMMA a home theater where I devour DVDs ,COMMA video-on-demand and a lot of television .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA Law and Order :COLON SVU ,COMMA Tine Fey and <NUM> Rock and Judge Judy -DASH -DASH The people are real ,COMMA the cases are real ,COMMA the rulings are final .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions ,COMMA especially my passion for Judge Judy ,COMMA and you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us ,COMMA but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life ,COMMA a passion for the live professional performing arts ,COMMA performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire ,COMMA yes ,COMMA but jazz as well ,COMMA modern dance ,COMMA opera ,COMMA theater and more and more and more .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology .PERIOD 
While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems ,COMMA we now realize that the Internet is ,COMMA if anything ,COMMA too effective in that regard .PERIOD 
Depending on who you read ,COMMA an arts organization or an artist ,COMMA who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer ,COMMA now competes with between three and <NUM> different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day .PERIOD 
We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time .PERIOD 
Five years ago ,COMMA Gen-X'ers spent <NUM> hours online and TV ,COMMA the majority on TV .PERIOD 
Gen-Y'ers spent even more -DASH -DASH <NUM> hours ,COMMA the majority online .PERIOD 
And now ,COMMA a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent <NUM> hours online and an additional <NUM> hours playing video games -DASH -DASH a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined .PERIOD 
Moreover ,COMMA we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption .PERIOD 
Thanks to the Internet ,COMMA we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it ,COMMA delivered to our own doorstep .PERIOD 
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ,COMMA ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body-types .PERIOD 
Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -DASH -DASH which have set curtain times ,COMMA set venues ,COMMA attendant inconveniences of travel ,COMMA parking and the like -DASH -DASH simply cannot meet .PERIOD 
These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain .PERIOD 
But as particular as they feel to us ,COMMA we know we're not alone .PERIOD 
All of us are engaged in a seismic ,COMMA fundamental realignment of culture and communications ,COMMA a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry ,COMMA the magazine industry ,COMMA the book and publishing industry and more .PERIOD 
Saddled in the performing arts as we are ,COMMA by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming ,COMMA locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues ,COMMA where we charge exorbitant prices .PERIOD 
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves ,COMMA Are we next ?QUESTIONMARK 
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich ,COMMA who ,COMMA in Dreams of a Common Language ,COMMA wrote ,COMMA We are out in a country that has no language ,COMMA no laws .PERIOD 
Whatever we do together is pure invention .PERIOD 
The maps they gave us are out of date by years .PERIOD 
And for those of you who love the arts ,COMMA aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation ,COMMA I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation ,COMMA a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century .PERIOD 
Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion ,COMMA internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models .PERIOD 
And at heart ,COMMA both reformations ,COMMA I think were asking the questions :COLON who's entitled to practice ?QUESTIONMARK 
How are they entitled to practice ?QUESTIONMARK 
And indeed ,COMMA do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ?QUESTIONMARK 
Chris Anderson ,COMMA someone I trust you all know ,COMMA editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail ,COMMA really was the first -DASH -DASH for me -DASH -DASH to nail a lot of this .PERIOD 
He wrote a long time ago ,COMMA you know ,COMMA thanks to the invention of the Internet ,COMMA web technology ,COMMA mini-cams and more ,COMMA the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history .PERIOD 
In the 1930s ,COMMA if any of you wanted to make a movie ,COMMA you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ?QUESTIONMARK 
And now who in this room doesn't know a <NUM> year-old hard at work on her second ,COMMA third ,COMMA or fourth movie ?QUESTIONMARK 
Similarly ,COMMA the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA in the '30s ,COMMA Warner Brothers ,COMMA RKO did that for you .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA go to YouTube ,COMMA Facebook ;SEMICOLON you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom .PERIOD 
This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market ,COMMA a time when anyone is a potential author .PERIOD 
Frankly ,COMMA what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time ,COMMA when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting .PERIOD 
But the number of arts participants ,COMMA people who write poetry ,COMMA who sing songs ,COMMA who perform in church choirs ,COMMA is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations .PERIOD 
You see them on YouTube ,COMMA in dance competitions ,COMMA film festivals and more .PERIOD 
They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary ,COMMA while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions .PERIOD 
Ultimately ,COMMA we now live in a world defined not by consumption ,COMMA but by participation .PERIOD 
They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -DASH -DASH not opulence -DASH -DASH of dignity .PERIOD 
And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home .PERIOD 
But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is ,COMMA by far ,COMMA too short-sighted .PERIOD 
And indeed ,COMMA while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional ,COMMA the single most exciting development in the last five to <NUM> years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist ,COMMA the professional artist who works ,COMMA not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage ;SEMICOLON but most frequently around women's rights ,COMMA or human rights ,COMMA or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more -DASH -DASH not out of economic necessity ,COMMA but out of a deep ,COMMA organic conviction that the work that she or he ,COMMA is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment .PERIOD 
Today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada ,COMMA but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange -DASH -DASH a multi-generational ,COMMA professional dance company ,COMMA whose dancers range in age from <NUM> to <NUM> ,COMMA and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN .PERIOD 
Today's professional theater community is defined ,COMMA not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals ,COMMA but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles -DASH -DASH a collective of artists that after <NUM>/<NUM> ,COMMA brought together <NUM> different religious communities -DASH -DASH the Bahia ,COMMA the Catholic ,COMMA the Muslim ,COMMA the Jewish ,COMMA even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith ,COMMA helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play ,COMMA where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross-community healing .PERIOD 
Today's performers ,COMMA like Rhodessa Jones ,COMMA work in women's prisons ,COMMA helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration ,COMMA while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we've said for a long time ,COMMA we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town .PERIOD 
And absolutely -DASH -DASH I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy ,COMMA dollars spent in restaurants or on parking ,COMMA at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes ,COMMA the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more .PERIOD 
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward ,COMMA especially in industries we can't even imagine yet ,COMMA just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries ,COMMA which few ,COMMA if any of us come have foreseen <NUM> to <NUM> years ago .PERIOD 
Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence ,COMMA the ability to listen deeply ,COMMA to have empathy ,COMMA to articulate change ,COMMA to motivate others -DASH -DASH the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter .PERIOD 
Especially now ,COMMA as we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation ,COMMA uninformed by social conscience ;SEMICOLON we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters ,COMMA and especially characters of the young people ,COMMA who all too often ,COMMA are subjected to bombardment of sensation ,COMMA rather than digested experience .PERIOD 
Ultimately ,COMMA especially now in this world ,COMMA where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws ,COMMA in reality TV that thrives on humiliation ,COMMA and in a context of analysis ,COMMA where the thing we hear most repeatedly ,COMMA day-in ,COMMA day-out in the United States ,COMMA in every train station ,COMMA every bus station ,COMMA every plane station is ,COMMA Ladies and gentlemen ,COMMA please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you ,COMMA when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion .PERIOD 
The arts ,COMMA whatever they do ,COMMA whenever they call us together ,COMMA invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity .PERIOD 
God knows ,COMMA if we ever needed that capacity in human history ,COMMA we need it now .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we're bound together ,COMMA not ,COMMA I think by technology ,COMMA entertainment and design ,COMMA but by common cause .PERIOD 
We work to promote healthy vibrant societies ,COMMA to ameliorate human suffering ,COMMA to promote a more thoughtful ,COMMA substantive ,COMMA empathic world order .PERIOD 
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come .PERIOD 
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon .PERIOD 
Thank you ,COMMA and godspeed .PERIOD 
Angella Ahn :COLON Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you so much .PERIOD 
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen ,COMMA sharing our music with you .PERIOD 
What an exciting and inspiring event .PERIOD 
What you just heard is Skylife by David Balakrishnan .PERIOD 
We want to play you one more selection .PERIOD 
It's by Astor Piazzolla ,COMMA an Argentine composer .PERIOD 
And we talk about different ideas -DASH -DASH he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart .PERIOD 
This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart ,COMMA beautiful music ,COMMA wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world .PERIOD 
It was more atonal and twelve-tone .PERIOD 
And he insisted on beautiful music .PERIOD 
So this is Oblivion by Astor Piazzolla .PERIOD 
It's a great honor to be here with you .PERIOD 
The good news is I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar .PERIOD 
And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech ,COMMA but I have a box of slides .PERIOD 
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living .PERIOD 
I've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words ,COMMA and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes .PERIOD 
The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh ,COMMA Pennsylvania ,COMMA in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead .PERIOD 
And on a Wednesday afternoon ,COMMA I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business .PERIOD And there was this artist teaching ,COMMA who made a great big old ceramic vessel ,COMMA and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room -DASH -DASH and if you've ever seen clay done ,COMMA it's magic -DASH -DASH and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I walked in the art room and I said ,COMMA What is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA Ceramics .PERIOD And who are you ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I said ,COMMA I'm Bill Strickland .PERIOD I want you to teach me that .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here ,COMMA and I'll teach it to you .PERIOD 
And so for the remaining two years of my high school ,COMMA I cut all my classes .PERIOD 
But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made ,COMMA and they gave me passing grades .PERIOD 
And that's how I got out of high school .PERIOD 
And Mr .PERIOD Ross said ,COMMA You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience ,COMMA so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me .PERIOD 
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I'm now a trustee of the university ,COMMA and at my installation ceremony I said ,COMMA I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation .PERIOD 
Don't give up on the poor kids ,COMMA because you never know what's going to happen to those children in life .PERIOD 
What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate .PERIOD 
One is called Bidwell Training Center ;SEMICOLON it is a vocational school for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers .PERIOD 
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA we don't make any steel anymore ,COMMA and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it .PERIOD 
And I rebuild them and give them new life .PERIOD 
I was adopted by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots ,COMMA and he donated a row house .PERIOD And in that row house I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild ,COMMA and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians ,COMMA there's money in very close proximity .PERIOD 
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid .PERIOD 
And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life .PERIOD 
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright ,COMMA the architect ,COMMA and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh .PERIOD 
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport .PERIOD 
And when you come to Pittsburgh -DASH -DASH and you're all invited -DASH -DASH you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building .PERIOD 
That's the building .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA it has a fountain in the courtyard .PERIOD 
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook ,COMMA so I bought one and put it there .PERIOD 
At a reception in their courtyard ,COMMA I noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain .PERIOD 
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -DASH -DASH water is life and water of human possibility -DASH -DASH and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA from that fountain I built this building .PERIOD 
As you can see ,COMMA it has world class art ,COMMA and it's all my taste because I raised all the money .PERIOD 
I said to my boy ,COMMA When you raise the money ,COMMA we'll put your taste on the wall .PERIOD 
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns ,COMMA there's something beautiful looking back at you ,COMMA that's deliberate .PERIOD 
That's intentional .PERIOD 
In my view ,COMMA it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people .PERIOD 
We also created a boardroom ,COMMA and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto ,COMMA Japan ,COMMA and commissioned him to do <NUM> pieces of furniture for our building .PERIOD 
We have since spun him off into his own business .PERIOD 
He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people .PERIOD 
And I got <NUM> pieces out of it for my school because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day .PERIOD 
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech .PERIOD 
We even have flowers in the hallway ,COMMA and they're not plastic .PERIOD 
Those are real and they're in my building every day .PERIOD 
And now that I've given lots of speeches ,COMMA we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Strickland ,COMMA what an extraordinary story and what a great school .PERIOD 
And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there .PERIOD 
You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids .PERIOD 
What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life .PERIOD 
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge .PERIOD 
And so in my building ,COMMA which is full of sunlight and full of flowers ,COMMA we believe in hope and human possibilities .PERIOD 
That happens to be at Christmas time .PERIOD 
And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company -DASH -DASH you've heard of them ?QUESTIONMARK 
They did all right in the ketchup business .PERIOD 
And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz ,COMMA who was our U.S .PERIOD senator -DASH -DASH who was tragically killed in a plane accident -DASH -DASH he had heard about my desire to build a new building ,COMMA because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site .PERIOD 
And he said ,COMMA But we've heard about you .PERIOD 
We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers ,COMMA and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .PERIOD 
And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program .PERIOD 
Because back then ,COMMA we were building a trades program .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Senator ,COMMA I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about ,COMMA but I promise you that if you'll support my school ,COMMA I'll get it built and in a couple of years ,COMMA I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire .PERIOD 
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what would your reaction be if I said I'd give you a million dollars ?QUESTIONMARK 
I said ,COMMA Senator ,COMMA it appears that we're going into the food training business .PERIOD 
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks .PERIOD 
And most importantly ,COMMA he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company .PERIOD 
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America ,COMMA which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools ,COMMA and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And we've never looked back .PERIOD 
I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen .PERIOD 
That happens to be our cafeteria line .PERIOD 
That's puff pastry day .PERIOD Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day .PERIOD 
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food .PERIOD 
That good food's not for rich people -DASH -DASH good food's for everybody on the planet ,COMMA and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it .PERIOD 
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center .PERIOD 
We have students who sit together ,COMMA black kids and white kids ,COMMA and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment ,COMMA because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .PERIOD 
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program .PERIOD 
No sophistication ,COMMA no class ,COMMA no dignity ,COMMA no history .PERIOD 
What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they don't have any money ,COMMA which happens to be a curable condition .PERIOD 
It's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior .PERIOD 
That was done by a student after seven months in the program ,COMMA done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef .PERIOD 
They have no calories .PERIOD 
That's our dining room .PERIOD 
It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America .PERIOD 
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated ,COMMA particularly once they have been pushed aside .PERIOD 
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry ,COMMA we train medical technicians for the medical industry ,COMMA and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon .PERIOD 
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh -DASH -DASH and you're all invited -DASH -DASH you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators <NUM> months from enrolling in the program .PERIOD 
There is absolutely no reason why poor people can't learn world class technology .PERIOD 
What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music ,COMMA and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .PERIOD 
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry .PERIOD 
We even teach people how to read .PERIOD 
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -DASH -DASH he's now an instructor .PERIOD 
And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read .PERIOD 
And so you must ask yourself the question :COLON how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands ?QUESTIONMARK 
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end ,COMMA not the children who read .PERIOD 
I can take these children and in <NUM> weeks ,COMMA demonstrated aptitude ;SEMICOLON I can get them high school equivalent .PERIOD 
No big deal .PERIOD 
That's our library with more handcrafted furniture .PERIOD 
And this is the arts program I started in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood ,COMMA the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm ,COMMA you can bring them right back to life .PERIOD 
I have <NUM> kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education .PERIOD 
And these are children who are flunking out of public school .PERIOD 
And last year I put <NUM> percent of those kids in college and I've averaged over <NUM> percent for <NUM> years .PERIOD 
We've made a fascinating discovery :COLON there's nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie's music can't cure .PERIOD 
For that I won a big old plaque -DASH -DASH Man of the Year in Education .PERIOD 
I beat out all the Ph.D.'s because I figured that if you treat children like human beings ,COMMA it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way .PERIOD 
And why we can't institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me .PERIOD 
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging .PERIOD 
And these are all kids with no artistic ability ,COMMA no talent ,COMMA no imagination .PERIOD And we bring in the world's greatest artists -DASH -DASH Gordon Parks has been there ,COMMA Chester Higgins has been there -DASH -DASH and what we've learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican ,COMMA an African-American woman who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques ,COMMA and let me show you what they did with the work .PERIOD 
These were children who the whole world had given up on ,COMMA who were flunking out of public school ,COMMA and that's what they're capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .PERIOD 
We teach photography .PERIOD 
And these are examples of some of the kids' work .PERIOD 
That boy won a four-year scholarship on the strength of that photograph .PERIOD 
This is our gallery .PERIOD 
We have smoked salmon at the art openings ,COMMA we have a formal printed invitation ,COMMA and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come .PERIOD 
I couldn't buy a parent <NUM> years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time .PERIOD 
He was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Bill ,COMMA I want to hire you ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit ,COMMA but keep the enthusiasm .PERIOD 
I can't get these parents to come to the school .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA I'll get them to come to the school .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I came to give you a ride .PERIOD 
And he got <NUM> parents and then <NUM> parents .PERIOD 
At the last show that we did ,COMMA <NUM> parents showed up and we didn't pick up one parent .PERIOD 
Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild because people think you're bad parents .PERIOD 
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated ,COMMA every time ,COMMA every town ,COMMA every city .PERIOD 
I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets .PERIOD 
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school ,COMMA they've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it's all up here .PERIOD 
You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior .PERIOD 
And it's worked out pretty good up to this day .PERIOD 
I even stuck another room on the building ,COMMA which I'd like to show you .PERIOD 
This is brand new .PERIOD 
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference .PERIOD 
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right .PERIOD 
And the woman came out of the audience ,COMMA she said ,COMMA That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation .PERIOD 
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA what do you do for a living ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I said ,COMMA You're in the computer business ,COMMA is that right ?QUESTIONMARK 
She said ,COMMA Yes ,COMMA sir .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America .PERIOD 
And that's the room that's initiating the relationship .PERIOD 
We got it just done in time to show you ,COMMA so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center .PERIOD 
I only have a couple more slides ,COMMA and this is where the story gets kind of interesting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it .PERIOD 
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here ,COMMA Marty Ashby .PERIOD 
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA Dizzy ,COMMA why would you come to a black-run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that doesn't even have a reputation in music ?QUESTIONMARK 
And now that I have ,COMMA I want to give you a gift .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA You're the gift .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA No ,COMMA sir .PERIOD You're the gift .PERIOD 
And I'm going to allow you to record the concert and I'm going to give you the music ,COMMA and if you ever choose to sell it ,COMMA you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school .PERIOD 
And I recorded Dizzy .PERIOD And he died a year later ,COMMA but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing .PERIOD 
And he showed up and said ,COMMA Dizzy talking about you all over the country ,COMMA man ,COMMA and I want to help you .PERIOD 
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up .PERIOD 
Then a bass player named Ray Brown ,COMMA and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine ,COMMA and a piano player named Herbie Hancock ,COMMA and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra ,COMMA and a fellow named Tito Puente ,COMMA and a guy named Gary Burton ,COMMA and Shirley Horn ,COMMA and Betty Carter ,COMMA and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that ,COMMA with their permission ,COMMA I have now accumulated <NUM> recordings of the greatest artists in the world ,COMMA including Joe Williams ,COMMA who died ,COMMA but not before his last recording was done at my school .PERIOD 
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said ,COMMA God's picked you ,COMMA man ,COMMA to do this work .PERIOD 
And I want my music to be with you .PERIOD 
And that worked out all right .PERIOD 
When the Basie band came ,COMMA the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music .PERIOD 
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy .PERIOD 
And like a fool ,COMMA I didn't go to the ceremony because I didn't think we were going to win .PERIOD 
Then the U.N .PERIOD Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've become one of the hot ,COMMA young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate .PERIOD 
That's the place all filled up with Republicans .PERIOD 
If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room ,COMMA you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there .PERIOD 
Including my mother and father ,COMMA who lived long enough to see their kid build that building .PERIOD 
And there's Dizzy ,COMMA just like I told you .PERIOD He was there .PERIOD 
And he was there ,COMMA Tito Puente .PERIOD 
And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us .PERIOD 
We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing and that's where we recorded the first Grammy .PERIOD 
And this is our new facility ,COMMA which is all video technology .PERIOD 
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson ,COMMA who recorded that album at our school last Christmas .PERIOD 
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day ,COMMA he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpts from this album ,COMMA the rights to which she donated to our school .PERIOD 
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell <NUM> CDs .PERIOD 
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts ,COMMA right behind Tony Bennett .PERIOD 
And I think we're going to be fine .PERIOD 
This was burned out during the riots -DASH -DASH this is next to my building -DASH -DASH and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again .PERIOD 
And that's the building ,COMMA and that's the model ,COMMA and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle's the medical technology building .PERIOD 
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done .PERIOD 
It's also full of anchor tenants at <NUM> dollars a foot -DASH -DASH triple that in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And there's the fountain .PERIOD 
Every building has a fountain .PERIOD 
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants and they took half the building ,COMMA and we now train medical technicians through all their system .PERIOD 
And Mellon Bank's a tenant .PERIOD 
And I love them because they pay the rent on time .PERIOD 
And as a result of the association ,COMMA I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus .PERIOD 
And this is in the process of being built as we speak .PERIOD 
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that's going to open in October this year because we're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And we're going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all <NUM> stores in six states .PERIOD 
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu ,COMMA California ,COMMA who are Hispanic .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city .PERIOD 
And I told my United States senator that there was a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this ,COMMA we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal ,COMMA to which he readily agreed .PERIOD 
And we got the funding and we open in the fall .PERIOD 
And you ought to come and see it -DASH -DASH it's going to be a hell of a story .PERIOD 
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake .PERIOD 
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park -DASH -DASH which is less than <NUM> feet from the riverfront -DASH -DASH for four million dollars and I didn't do it .PERIOD 
And I built the first building ,COMMA and guess what happened ?QUESTIONMARK 
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year ,COMMA and said ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Strickland ,COMMA you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award because you've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations .PERIOD 
Thank you very much for that .PERIOD 
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams ,COMMA just in case they do come true .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA there's this picture .PERIOD 
And the reason this picture's in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit ,COMMA and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA Man ,COMMA that's a great story .PERIOD 
I want one of those .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I'm very flattered .PERIOD What do you do for a living ?QUESTIONMARK 
He says ,COMMA I run the city of San Francisco .PERIOD 
My name's Willie Brown .PERIOD 
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind .PERIOD 
And that weekend ,COMMA I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night -DASH -DASH first time I'd met him .PERIOD 
And he walked in and he says ,COMMA What is this ?QUESTIONMARK 
And he said ,COMMA As God as my witness ,COMMA I've had a center like this in my mind for <NUM> years and you've built it .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA where would you build this thing ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA San Francisco .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Any chance you know Willie Brown ?QUESTIONMARK 
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown ,COMMA and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago ,COMMA and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth .PERIOD 
And Willie Brown said ,COMMA As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco ,COMMA I'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city .PERIOD 
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board ,COMMA and our friends from HP ,COMMA and our friends from Steelcase ,COMMA and our friends from Cisco ,COMMA and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech .PERIOD 
And along the way ,COMMA I met this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley .PERIOD 
He came up to me afterwards ,COMMA he said ,COMMA Man ,COMMA that's a fabulous story .PERIOD 
I want to help you .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA thank you very much for that .PERIOD 
What do you do for a living ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I built a company called eBay .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's very nice .PERIOD 
Thanks very much ,COMMA and give me your card and sometime we'll talk .PERIOD 
I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano ,COMMA but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Hey man ,COMMA what is eBay ?QUESTIONMARK 
He said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA that's the electronic commerce network .PERIOD 
I said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I called him up on the phone and I said ,COMMA Mr .PERIOD Skoll ,COMMA I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and I'd like to become your friend .PERIOD 
And Jeff and I did become friends ,COMMA and he's organized a team of people and we're going to build this center .PERIOD 
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point ,COMMA and I said ,COMMA The mayor sent me down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you ,COMMA but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it .PERIOD 
And all I've got is a box of slides .PERIOD 
And so I stood up in front of <NUM> very angry ,COMMA very disappointed people on a summer night ,COMMA and the air conditioner had broken and it was <NUM> degrees outside ,COMMA and I started showing these pictures .PERIOD 
And after about <NUM> pictures they all settled down .PERIOD 
And I ran the story and I said ,COMMA What do you think ?QUESTIONMARK 
And in the back of the room ,COMMA a woman stood up and she said ,COMMA In <NUM> years of living in this God forsaken place ,COMMA you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity .PERIOD 
I'm going with you ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
And she turned that audience around on a pin .PERIOD 
And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh .PERIOD 
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way and I showed him the box of slides .PERIOD 
And Quincy said ,COMMA I want to help you ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
Let's do one in L.A .PERIOD 
And so he's assembled a group of people .PERIOD 
And I've fallen in love with him ,COMMA as I have with Herbie and with his music .PERIOD 
And Quincy said ,COMMA Where did the idea for centers like this come from ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I said ,COMMA It came from your music ,COMMA man .PERIOD 
Because Mr .PERIOD Ross used to bring in your albums when I was <NUM> years old in the pottery class ,COMMA when the world was all dark ,COMMA and your music got me to the sunlight .PERIOD 
And if that's not true ,COMMA how did I get here ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want you all to know that I think the world is a place that's worth living .PERIOD 
I believe in you .PERIOD 
I believe in your hopes and your dreams ,COMMA I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm .PERIOD 
And I'm tired of living like this ,COMMA going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be ,COMMA their spirits damaged .PERIOD 
We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around .PERIOD 
In Pennsylvania it costs <NUM> dollars to keep people in jail ,COMMA most of whom look like me .PERIOD 
It's <NUM> dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School .PERIOD 
It's <NUM> dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail .PERIOD 
Do the math -DASH -DASH it will never work .PERIOD 
I am banking on you and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something .PERIOD 
And I want to do this in my lifetime ,COMMA in every city and in every town .PERIOD 
I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we're spending on prisons .PERIOD 
And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope .PERIOD 
In my business it's very difficult work .PERIOD 
You're always fighting upstream like a salmon -DASH -DASH never enough money ,COMMA too much need -DASH -DASH and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work .PERIOD 
And so I've figured out ,COMMA over time ,COMMA the solution to the depression :COLON you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely .PERIOD 
And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight .PERIOD 
And thanks for listening to what I had to say .PERIOD 
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth .PERIOD 
They've been here for billions of years ,COMMA and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms .PERIOD 
So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA .PERIOD 
They have very few genes ,COMMA and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .PERIOD 
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment ,COMMA they grow to twice their size ,COMMA they cut themselves down in the middle ,COMMA and one cell becomes two ,COMMA and so on and so on .PERIOD 
They just grow and divide ,COMMA and grow and divide -DASH -DASH so a kind of boring life ,COMMA except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters .PERIOD 
I know you guys think of yourself as humans ,COMMA and this is sort of how I think of you .PERIOD 
This man is supposed to represent a generic human being ,COMMA and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .PERIOD 
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do ,COMMA but you have <NUM> trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .PERIOD 
And of course it's the DNA that counts ,COMMA so here's all the A ,COMMA T ,COMMA Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code ,COMMA and give you all your charming characteristics .PERIOD 
You have about <NUM> genes .PERIOD 
Well it turns out you have <NUM> times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .PERIOD 
I know you think of yourself as human beings ,COMMA but I think of you as <NUM> or <NUM> percent bacterial .PERIOD 
These bacteria are not passive riders ,COMMA these are incredibly important ,COMMA they keep us alive .PERIOD 
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy .PERIOD 
They digest our food ,COMMA they make our vitamins ,COMMA they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .PERIOD 
So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive ,COMMA and they never get any press for that .PERIOD 
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time ,COMMA and if they are ,COMMA they make you incredibly sick .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do ,COMMA or all the bad things that bacteria do .PERIOD 
The question we had is how could they do anything at all ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean they're incredibly small ,COMMA you have to have a microscope to see one .PERIOD 
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide ,COMMA and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms .PERIOD 
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .PERIOD 
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium ,COMMA and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri .PERIOD 
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light ,COMMA so it makes bioluminescence ,COMMA like fireflies make light .PERIOD 
We're not doing anything to the cells here .PERIOD 
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light ,COMMA but when the bacteria made light .PERIOD 
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone ,COMMA so when they were in dilute suspension ,COMMA they made no light .PERIOD 
What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other ,COMMA and they talk with a chemical language .PERIOD 
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .PERIOD 
When it's alone it doesn't make any light .PERIOD 
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones ,COMMA and these are the red triangles ,COMMA and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light .PERIOD 
But when the bacteria grow and double and they're all participating in making these molecules ,COMMA the molecule -DASH -DASH the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number .PERIOD 
And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are ,COMMA they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony .PERIOD 
That's how bioluminescence works -DASH -DASH they're talking with these chemical words .PERIOD 
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA another plug for the animals in the ocean ,COMMA Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .PERIOD 
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid ,COMMA and it's been turned on its back ,COMMA and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells ,COMMA they live in there ,COMMA at high cell number that molecule is there ,COMMA and they're making light .PERIOD 
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light .PERIOD 
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii ,COMMA just in sort of shallow knee-deep water .PERIOD 
The squid is nocturnal ,COMMA so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps ,COMMA but then at night it has to come out to hunt .PERIOD 
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in ,COMMA since it's just in those couple feet of water .PERIOD 
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria .PERIOD 
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back .PERIOD 
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -DASH -DASH which is made by the bacterium -DASH -DASH exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back ,COMMA so the squid doesn't make a shadow .PERIOD 
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can't see its shadow ,COMMA calculate its trajectory ,COMMA and eat it .PERIOD 
But then if you think about it ,COMMA the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying ,COMMA thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that .PERIOD 
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep ,COMMA it buries itself in the sand ,COMMA and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm ,COMMA and when the sun comes up it pumps out like <NUM> percent of the bacteria .PERIOD 
Now the bacteria are dilute ,COMMA that little hormone molecule is gone ,COMMA so they're not making light -DASH -DASH but of course the squid doesn't care .PERIOD It's asleep in the sand .PERIOD 
And as the day goes by the bacteria double ,COMMA they release the molecule ,COMMA and then light comes on at night ,COMMA exactly when the squid wants it .PERIOD 
First we figured out how this bacterium does this ,COMMA but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what's the mechanism .PERIOD 
And what we found -DASH -DASH so this is now supposed to be ,COMMA again ,COMMA my bacterial cell -DASH -DASH is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -DASH -DASH that's the red box -DASH -DASH it's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule ,COMMA the red triangle .PERIOD 
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule .PERIOD 
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .PERIOD 
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -DASH -DASH which says something about the number of cells -DASH -DASH it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .PERIOD 
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous ,COMMA glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -DASH -DASH all bacteria have systems like this .PERIOD 
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .PERIOD 
They make chemical words ,COMMA they recognize those words ,COMMA and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .PERIOD 
We have a fancy name for this :COLON we call it quorum sensing .PERIOD 
They vote with these chemical votes ,COMMA the vote gets counted ,COMMA and then everybody responds to the vote .PERIOD 
What's important for today's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .PERIOD 
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -DASH -DASH you're enormous ,COMMA that would have no effect on you .PERIOD You're huge .PERIOD 
What they do ,COMMA we now understand ,COMMA is they get in you ,COMMA they wait ,COMMA they start growing ,COMMA they count themselves with these little molecules ,COMMA and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together ,COMMA they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host .PERIOD 
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .PERIOD 
That's how it works .PERIOD 
We also then went to look at what are these molecules -DASH -DASH these were the red triangles on my slides before .PERIOD 
This is the word that it talks with .PERIOD 
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related .PERIOD 
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .PERIOD 
So these are private ,COMMA secret conversations .PERIOD 
These conversations are for intraspecies communication .PERIOD 
Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors .PERIOD 
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don't live by themselves ,COMMA they live in incredible mixtures ,COMMA with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria .PERIOD 
And that's depicted on this slide .PERIOD This is your skin .PERIOD 
So this is just a picture -DASH -DASH a micrograph of your skin .PERIOD 
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria ,COMMA and it's about counting your neighbors ,COMMA it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species .PERIOD 
There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population .PERIOD 
So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria ,COMMA and what we've found now is that in fact ,COMMA bacteria are multilingual .PERIOD 
They all have a species-specific system -DASH -DASH they have a molecule that says me .PERIOD 
But then ,COMMA running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered ,COMMA that's generic .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor ,COMMA and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria .PERIOD 
It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication .PERIOD 
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you .PERIOD 
They take that information inside ,COMMA and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population .PERIOD 
Then again we turn to chemistry ,COMMA and we figured out what this generic molecule is -DASH -DASH that was the pink ovals on my last slide ,COMMA this is it .PERIOD 
It's a very small ,COMMA five-carbon molecule .PERIOD 
What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule .PERIOD 
So they're all using this molecule for interspecies communication .PERIOD 
This is the bacterial Esperanto .PERIOD 
Once we got that far ,COMMA we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .PERIOD 
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well .PERIOD 
I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors ,COMMA they communicate with these molecules .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA I've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing .PERIOD 
We thought ,COMMA what if we made these bacteria so they can't talk or they can't hear ?QUESTIONMARK 
Of course ,COMMA you've just heard and you already know that we're running out of antibiotics .PERIOD 
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now ,COMMA and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .PERIOD 
They either pop the bacterial membrane ,COMMA they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA .PERIOD 
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .PERIOD 
We thought ,COMMA well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications ,COMMA just make these bacteria so they can't talk ,COMMA they can't count ,COMMA and they don't know to launch virulence .PERIOD 
And so that's exactly what we've done ,COMMA and we've sort of taken two strategies .PERIOD 
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -DASH -DASH which you saw -DASH -DASH but they're a little bit different .PERIOD 
And so they lock into those receptors ,COMMA and they jam recognition of the real thing .PERIOD 
By targeting the red system ,COMMA what we are able to do is to make species-specific ,COMMA or disease-specific ,COMMA anti-quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD 
We've also done the same thing with the pink system .PERIOD 
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .PERIOD 
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria .PERIOD 
To finish I'll just show you the strategy .PERIOD 
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule ,COMMA but the logic is exactly the same .PERIOD 
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal ,COMMA in this case ,COMMA a mouse ,COMMA it doesn't initiate virulence right away .PERIOD 
It gets in ,COMMA it starts growing ,COMMA it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .PERIOD 
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they're going to launch their attack ,COMMA and the animal dies .PERIOD 
What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections ,COMMA but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -DASH -DASH so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing ,COMMA but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide .PERIOD 
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium -DASH -DASH a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium -DASH -DASH in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA the animal lives .PERIOD 
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it's going to get us around ,COMMA at least initially ,COMMA this big problem of resistance .PERIOD 
What I hope you think ,COMMA is that bacteria can talk to each other ,COMMA they use chemicals as their words ,COMMA they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we're just now starting to learn about .PERIOD 
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .PERIOD 
So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together because it makes a difference .PERIOD 
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors ,COMMA and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .PERIOD 
What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity .PERIOD 
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years ;SEMICOLON humans ,COMMA couple hundred thousand .PERIOD 
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .PERIOD 
We think ,COMMA by studying bacteria ,COMMA we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .PERIOD 
We know that the principles and the rules ,COMMA if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms ,COMMA the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .PERIOD 
By using these two molecules they can say me and they can say you .PERIOD 
Again of course that's what we do ,COMMA both in a molecular way ,COMMA and also in an outward way ,COMMA but I think about the molecular stuff .PERIOD 
It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day ,COMMA and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on ,COMMA these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is ,COMMA and what their tasks should be .PERIOD 
Again ,COMMA we think that bacteria invented that ,COMMA and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles ,COMMA but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study .PERIOD 
The final thing is ,COMMA again just to reiterate that there's this practical part ,COMMA and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .PERIOD 
What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you ,COMMA in the hopes of making you more healthy ,COMMA making those conversations better ,COMMA so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton ,COMMA New Jersey .PERIOD 
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture .PERIOD 
I hope when you learn things ,COMMA like about how the natural world works -DASH -DASH I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .PERIOD 
Science is done by that demographic .PERIOD 
All of those people are between <NUM> and <NUM> years old ,COMMA and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country .PERIOD 
It's a really lucky demographic to work with .PERIOD 
I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age ,COMMA and it's just a crazy delightful job .PERIOD 
I want to thank you for inviting me here .PERIOD 
It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD 
I study how the brain processes information .PERIOD That is ,COMMA how it takes information in from the outside world ,COMMA and converts it into patterns of electrical activity ,COMMA and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -DASH -DASH to see ,COMMA hear ,COMMA to reach for an object .PERIOD 
It's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness .PERIOD 
So let me start in on that problem .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> million people in the U.S .PERIOD 
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina ,COMMA diseases like macular degeneration ,COMMA and there's little that can be done for them .PERIOD 
There are some drug treatments ,COMMA but they're only effective on a small fraction of the population .PERIOD And so ,COMMA for the vast majority of patients ,COMMA their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices .PERIOD 
The problem is that current prosthetics don't work very well .PERIOD They're still very limited in the vision that they can provide .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA for example ,COMMA with these devices ,COMMA patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges ,COMMA not very much more ,COMMA so nothing close to normal vision has been possible .PERIOD 
So what I'm going to tell you about today is a device that we've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference ,COMMA to be much more effective ,COMMA and what I wanted to do is show you how it works .PERIOD Okay ,COMMA so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .PERIOD 
Here you have a retina .PERIOD 
So you have an image ,COMMA a retina ,COMMA and a brain .PERIOD 
So when you look at something ,COMMA like this image of this baby's face ,COMMA it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina ,COMMA on the front-end cells here ,COMMA the photoreceptors .PERIOD 
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry ,COMMA the middle part ,COMMA goes to work on it ,COMMA and what it does is it performs operations on it ,COMMA it extracts information from it ,COMMA and it converts that information into a code .PERIOD 
And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain ,COMMA and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code .PERIOD And when I say code ,COMMA I do literally mean code .PERIOD 
Anyway ,COMMA you get the idea .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA in real life ,COMMA it's all dynamic ,COMMA meaning that it's changing all the time ,COMMA so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you're looking at is changing all the time too .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it's sort of a complicated thing .PERIOD You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you're seeing .PERIOD 
So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ?QUESTIONMARK What happens is is that ,COMMA the front-end cells die ,COMMA the photoreceptors die ,COMMA and over time ,COMMA all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them ,COMMA they die too .PERIOD 
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here ,COMMA the output cells ,COMMA the ones that send the signals to the brain ,COMMA but because of all that degeneration they aren't sending any signals anymore .PERIOD 
They aren't getting any input ,COMMA so the person's brain no longer gets any visual information -DASH -DASH that is ,COMMA he or she is blind .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA a solution to the problem ,COMMA then ,COMMA would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina's output cells ,COMMA and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .PERIOD 
So it consists of two parts ,COMMA what we call an encoder and a transducer .PERIOD 
And so the encoder does just what I was saying :COLON it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -DASH -DASH so it takes images in and converts them into the retina's code .PERIOD 
And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain ,COMMA and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .PERIOD 
So no other device has been able to do this .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it's doing ,COMMA because it's really the key part and it's sort of interesting and kind of cool .PERIOD 
I'm not sure cool is really the right word ,COMMA but you know what I mean .PERIOD 
So what it's doing is ,COMMA it's replacing the retinal circuitry ,COMMA really the guts of the retinal circuitry ,COMMA with a set of equations ,COMMA a set of equations that we can implement on a chip .PERIOD So it's just math .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA we're not literally replacing the components of the retina .PERIOD 
It's not like we're making a little mini-device for each of the different cell types .PERIOD 
We've just abstracted what the retina's doing with a set of equations .PERIOD 
And so ,COMMA in a way ,COMMA the equations are serving as sort of a codebook .PERIOD An image comes in ,COMMA goes through the set of equations ,COMMA and out comes streams of electrical pulses ,COMMA just like a normal retina would produce .PERIOD 
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output ,COMMA and what the implications of this are .PERIOD 
Here are three sets of firing patterns .PERIOD The top one is from a normal animal ,COMMA the middle one is from a blind animal that's been treated with this encoder-transducer device ,COMMA and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .PERIOD 
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art device that's out there right now ,COMMA which is basically made up of light detectors ,COMMA but no encoder .PERIOD So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things -DASH -DASH people ,COMMA babies ,COMMA park benches ,COMMA you know ,COMMA regular things happening -DASH -DASH and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals .PERIOD 
Now just to orient you ,COMMA each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells ,COMMA and just as in the previous slides ,COMMA each row is a different cell ,COMMA and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data .PERIOD 
So as you can see ,COMMA the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -DASH -DASH and it's not perfect ,COMMA but it's pretty good -DASH -DASH and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic ,COMMA the responses really don't .PERIOD 
How important is this ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's the potential impact on a patient's ability to see ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I'm just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this ,COMMA and of course I've got a lot of other data ,COMMA so if you're interested I'm happy to show more .PERIOD So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment .PERIOD 
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked ,COMMA what was the retina seeing at that moment ?QUESTIONMARK 
Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .PERIOD 
So let me show you ,COMMA and I'm going to start with the standard method first .PERIOD 
So you can see that it's pretty limited ,COMMA and because the firing patterns aren't in the right code ,COMMA they're very limited in what they can tell you about what's out there .PERIOD So you can see that there's something there ,COMMA but it's not so clear what that something is ,COMMA and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning ,COMMA that with the standard method ,COMMA patients can see high-contrast edges ,COMMA they can see light ,COMMA but it doesn't easily go further than that .PERIOD So what was the image ?QUESTIONMARK It was a baby's face .PERIOD 
So what about with our approach ,COMMA adding the code ?QUESTIONMARK And you can see that it's much better .PERIOD Not only can you tell that it's a baby's face ,COMMA but you can tell that it's this baby's face ,COMMA which is a really challenging task .PERIOD 
So on the left is the encoder alone ,COMMA and on the right is from an actual blind retina ,COMMA so the encoder and the transducer .PERIOD 
But the key one really is the encoder alone ,COMMA because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .PERIOD 
I just wanted to say something about the standard method .PERIOD 
When this first came out ,COMMA it was just a really exciting thing ,COMMA the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all .PERIOD 
But there was this limiting factor ,COMMA the issue of the code ,COMMA and how to make the cells respond better ,COMMA produce normal responses ,COMMA and so this was our contribution .PERIOD 
Now I just want to wrap up ,COMMA and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you're interested ,COMMA but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language ,COMMA and the potential power of being able to do that .PERIOD 
And then the last thing I wanted to say ,COMMA really ,COMMA is to emphasize that the idea generalizes .PERIOD 
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas ,COMMA for example ,COMMA the auditory system and the motor system ,COMMA so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .PERIOD 
So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's output cells ,COMMA we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve ,COMMA or jump over damaged areas in the cortex ,COMMA in the motor cortex ,COMMA to bridge the gap produced by a stroke .PERIOD 
I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really ,COMMA really important ,COMMA and if we can understand the code ,COMMA the language of the brain ,COMMA things become possible that didn't seem obviously possible before .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
One thing the world needs ,COMMA one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates .PERIOD 
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .PERIOD 
If you think about the arguments we have ,COMMA most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ,COMMA ideological food fights on the floor of Congress .PERIOD 
I have a suggestion .PERIOD 
Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care ,COMMA over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street ,COMMA over the gap between rich and poor ,COMMA over affirmative action and same-sex marriage .PERIOD 
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments ,COMMA with passions raging on all sides ,COMMA are big questions of moral philosophy ,COMMA big questions of justice .PERIOD 
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics .PERIOD 
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality ,COMMA give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens ,COMMA Aristotle's theory of justice ,COMMA and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA are you ready for the lecture ?QUESTIONMARK 
According to Aristotle ,COMMA justice means giving people what they deserve .PERIOD 
That's it ;SEMICOLON that's the lecture .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA you may say ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's obvious enough .PERIOD 
The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why .PERIOD 
Take the example of flutes .PERIOD 
Suppose we're distributing flutes .PERIOD 
Who should get the best ones ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's see what people -DASH -DASH What would you say ?QUESTIONMARK 
Who should get the best flute ?QUESTIONMARK 
Michael Sandel :COLON At random .PERIOD You would do it by lottery .PERIOD 
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .PERIOD 
The best flute players .PERIOD 
How many say the best flute players ?QUESTIONMARK 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
But here's a harder question .PERIOD 
Why do you think ,COMMA those of you who voted this way ,COMMA that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ?QUESTIONMARK 
We'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players .PERIOD 
That's Peter ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA it's a good reason .PERIOD 
We'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music .PERIOD 
But Peter ,COMMA Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason .PERIOD 
That's all right .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA that's what flutes are for -DASH -DASH to be played well .PERIOD 
He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing ,COMMA we have to reason about ,COMMA and sometimes argue about ,COMMA the purpose of the thing ,COMMA or the social activity -DASH -DASH in this case ,COMMA musical performance .PERIOD 
It'll be a happy byproduct that we'll all benefit .PERIOD 
But when we think about justice ,COMMA Aristotle says ,COMMA what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing .PERIOD 
One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy ,COMMA but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA flutes may seem .. .PERIOD the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case .PERIOD 
Let's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .PERIOD 
It had to do with golf .PERIOD 
Casey Martin -DASH -DASH a few years ago ,COMMA Casey Martin -DASH -DASH did any of you hear about him ?QUESTIONMARK 
He was a very good golfer ,COMMA but he had a disability .PERIOD 
He had a bad leg ,COMMA a circulatory problem ,COMMA that made it very painful for him to walk the course .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it carried risk of injury .PERIOD 
He asked the PGA ,COMMA the Professional Golfers' Association ,COMMA for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA No .PERIOD 
Now that would give you an unfair advantage .PERIOD 
He sued ,COMMA and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court ,COMMA believe it or not ,COMMA the case over the golf cart ,COMMA because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated ,COMMA provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity .PERIOD 
He says ,COMMA I'm a great golfer .PERIOD 
I want to compete .PERIOD 
But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next .PERIOD 
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how many say ,COMMA no ,COMMA he doesn't ?QUESTIONMARK 
All right ,COMMA let's take a poll ,COMMA show of hands .PERIOD 
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ?QUESTIONMARK 
And how many would not ?QUESTIONMARK How many would say he doesn't ?QUESTIONMARK 
All right ,COMMA we have a good division of opinion here .PERIOD 
Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart ,COMMA what would be your reason ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would be your reason ?QUESTIONMARK 
It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .PERIOD 
All right ,COMMA those of you ,COMMA I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage .PERIOD 
What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart ?QUESTIONMARK 
How would you answer the objection ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes ,COMMA all right .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON The cart's not part of the game .PERIOD 
What's your name ?QUESTIONMARK 
Charlie says -DASH -DASH We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply .PERIOD 
Tell us ,COMMA Charlie ,COMMA why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ?QUESTIONMARK 
Charlie :COLON The cart's not part of the game .PERIOD 
But what about walking from hole to hole ?QUESTIONMARK 
Charlie :COLON It doesn't matter ;SEMICOLON it's not part of the game .PERIOD 
Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ?QUESTIONMARK 
Charlie :COLON Not in my book ,COMMA it isn't .PERIOD 
All right .PERIOD Stay there ,COMMA Charlie .PERIOD 
Who has an answer for Charlie ?QUESTIONMARK 
All right ,COMMA who has an answer for Charlie ?QUESTIONMARK 
What would you say ?QUESTIONMARK 
Audience :COLON The endurance element is a very important part of the game ,COMMA walking all those holes .PERIOD 
Walking all those holes ?QUESTIONMARK 
What's your name ?QUESTIONMARK 
Warren .PERIOD 
Charley :COLON I'll stick to my original thesis .PERIOD 
Warren ,COMMA are you a golfer ?QUESTIONMARK 
Charley :COLON And I am .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA it's interesting .PERIOD 
In the case ,COMMA in the lower court ,COMMA they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue .PERIOD 
Is walking the course essential to the game ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer .PERIOD 
And what do you suppose they all said ?QUESTIONMARK 
Yes .PERIOD They agreed with Warren .PERIOD 
They said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA walking the course is strenuous physical exercise .PERIOD 
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf .PERIOD 
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA notice ,COMMA something interesting -DASH -DASH Well ,COMMA I should tell you about the Supreme Court first .PERIOD 
The Supreme Court decided .PERIOD 
What do you suppose they said ?QUESTIONMARK 
They said yes ,COMMA that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart .PERIOD 
Seven to two ,COMMA they ruled .PERIOD 
What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right ,COMMA the justice ,COMMA of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf .PERIOD 
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question .PERIOD 
And Justice Stevens ,COMMA writing for the majority ,COMMA said he had read all about the history of golf ,COMMA and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible ,COMMA and that walking was not essential ,COMMA but incidental .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there were two dissenters ,COMMA one of whom was Justice Scalia .PERIOD 
It's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion .PERIOD 
He said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .PERIOD 
Here's how he put it .PERIOD 
To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object .PERIOD 
So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion .PERIOD 
Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons .PERIOD 
If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary ,COMMA rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring ,COMMA we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game .PERIOD 
It's also objectionable on a second ground .PERIOD 
But if fairness were the only thing at stake ,COMMA there would have been an easy and obvious solution .PERIOD 
What would it be ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .PERIOD 
Then the fairness objection goes away .PERIOD 
But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been ,COMMA I suspect ,COMMA more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA ,COMMA even than making an exception for Casey Martin .PERIOD 
Why ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf ,COMMA but ,COMMA relatedly ,COMMA the question :COLON What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let me put the point as delicately as possible :COLON Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game .PERIOD 
After all ,COMMA there's no running or jumping ,COMMA and the ball stands still .PERIOD 
That illustrates that with golf ,COMMA as with flutes ,COMMA it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires ,COMMA without grappling with the question ,COMMA What is the essential nature of the activity in question ,COMMA and what qualities ,COMMA what excellences connected with that activity ,COMMA are worthy of honor and recognition ?QUESTIONMARK 
Let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate :COLON same-sex marriage .PERIOD 
There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman ,COMMA and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage .PERIOD 
And how many favor the second ,COMMA same-sex marriage ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA put it this way :COLON What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ?QUESTIONMARK 
The opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA is procreation ,COMMA and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging .PERIOD 
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no ,COMMA procreation is not the only purpose of marriage ;SEMICOLON what about a lifelong ,COMMA mutual ,COMMA loving commitment ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's really what marriage is about .PERIOD 
So with flutes ,COMMA with golf carts ,COMMA and even with a fiercely contested question like same-sex marriage ,COMMA Aristotle has a point .PERIOD 
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition .PERIOD 
So let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve ,COMMA elevate ,COMMA the terms of political discourse in the United States ,COMMA and for that matter ,COMMA around the world .PERIOD 
There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics ,COMMA that's a recipe for disagreement ,COMMA and for that matter ,COMMA a recipe for intolerance and coercion .PERIOD 
So better to shy away from ,COMMA to ignore ,COMMA the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life .PERIOD 
It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite ,COMMA that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life ,COMMA rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter .PERIOD 
That ,COMMA it seems to me ,COMMA is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Thanks .PERIOD Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris .PERIOD 
Thanks ,COMMA Chris .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON From flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage -DASH -DASH that was a genius link .PERIOD 
Now look ,COMMA you're a pioneer of open education .PERIOD 
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big .PERIOD 
What's your vision for the next phase of this ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA I think that it is possible .PERIOD 
In the classroom ,COMMA we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .PERIOD 
And I think we can do that in public life more generally .PERIOD 
And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we've created of the course -DASH -DASH it's available now ,COMMA online ,COMMA free for everyone anywhere in the world -DASH -DASH and to see whether we can partner with institutions ,COMMA at universities in China ,COMMA in India ,COMMA in Africa ,COMMA around the world ,COMMA to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate .PERIOD 
So you picture ,COMMA at some point ,COMMA live ,COMMA in real time ,COMMA you could have this kind of conversation ,COMMA inviting questions ,COMMA but with people from China and India joining in ?QUESTIONMARK 
Right .PERIOD We did a little bit of it here with <NUM> people in Long Beach ,COMMA and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about <NUM> students .PERIOD 
Wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing ,COMMA engaging seriously with big moral questions ,COMMA exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup ,COMMA students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge ,COMMA Massachusetts and create a global classroom .PERIOD 
That's what I would love to do .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor .PERIOD 
Michael Sandel .PERIOD Thank you so much .PERIOD 
<NUM> minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit ,COMMA so I'm going to dive straight in ,COMMA right at the point where I get this thing to work .PERIOD 
Here we go .PERIOD I'm going to talk about five different things .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well ,COMMA of course .PERIOD 
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging .PERIOD 
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong ,COMMA namely ,COMMA by actually doing something about it .PERIOD 
I'm going to do that in two steps .PERIOD 
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -DASH -DASH which I'm going to define as <NUM> years ,COMMA applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -DASH -DASH to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .PERIOD 
Namely ,COMMA essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -DASH -DASH or indeed ,COMMA to get sick in the first place .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step ,COMMA that point of maybe <NUM> years life extension .PERIOD 
So I'm going to start with why we should .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I want to ask a question .PERIOD 
Hands up :COLON anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK .PERIOD So we all think malaria is a bad thing .PERIOD 
That's very good news ,COMMA because I thought that was what the answer would be .PERIOD 
Now the thing is ,COMMA I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .PERIOD 
And here is that characteristic .PERIOD 
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA I like in an audience ,COMMA in Britain especially ,COMMA to talk about the comparison with foxhunting ,COMMA which is something that was banned after a long struggle ,COMMA by the government not very many months ago .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here ,COMMA but ,COMMA as we know ,COMMA a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .PERIOD 
And this is actually a rather good comparison ,COMMA it seems to me .PERIOD 
It's a traditional part of the way of life ,COMMA and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .PERIOD 
It's ecologically sound ;SEMICOLON it stops the population explosion of foxes .PERIOD 
But ultimately ,COMMA the government prevailed in the end ,COMMA because the majority of the British public ,COMMA and certainly the majority of members of Parliament ,COMMA came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .PERIOD 
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .PERIOD 
What part of this do people not understand ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's not just about life ,COMMA of course -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH it's about healthy life ,COMMA you know -DASH -DASH getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun ,COMMA whether or not dying may be fun .PERIOD 
So really ,COMMA this is how I would like to describe it .PERIOD 
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA I mean ,COMMA OK ,COMMA I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless .PERIOD 
There are some good points to be made here ,COMMA things that we ought to be thinking about ,COMMA forward planning so that nothing goes too -DASH -DASH well ,COMMA so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .PERIOD 
But these are completely crazy ,COMMA when you actually remember your sense of proportion .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA these are arguments ;SEMICOLON these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about .PERIOD 
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning <NUM> people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?QUESTIONMARK 
You know ,COMMA if you haven't got an argument that's that strong ,COMMA then just don't waste my time ,COMMA is what I say .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong ,COMMA and here it is .PERIOD 
And therefore ,COMMA we're not going to be able to have many kids ,COMMA and kids are really important to most people .PERIOD 
And that's true .PERIOD 
And you know ,COMMA a lot of people try to fudge this question ,COMMA and give answers like this .PERIOD 
I don't agree with those answers .PERIOD I think they basically don't work .PERIOD 
I think it's true ,COMMA that we will face a dilemma in this respect .PERIOD 
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate ,COMMA or a high death rate .PERIOD 
A high death rate will ,COMMA of course ,COMMA arise from simply rejecting these therapies ,COMMA in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA I say that that's fine -DASH -DASH the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .PERIOD 
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .PERIOD 
If we vacillate ,COMMA hesitate ,COMMA and do not actually develop these therapies ,COMMA then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -DASH -DASH who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies ,COMMA but will not be ,COMMA because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -DASH -DASH we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span ,COMMA and I consider that that is immoral .PERIOD 
That's my answer to the overpopulation question .PERIOD 
Right .PERIOD So the next thing is ,COMMA now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?QUESTIONMARK 
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .PERIOD 
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .PERIOD 
Aging is ghastly ,COMMA but it's inevitable ,COMMA so ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds ,COMMA and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do ,COMMA to do that .PERIOD 
Like ,COMMA for example ,COMMA making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .PERIOD 
But of course ,COMMA that only works when we have both of these components .PERIOD 
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -DASH -DASH and we might be in range of doing something about aging -DASH -DASH this becomes part of the problem .PERIOD 
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -DASH -DASH evangelize ,COMMA I will go so far as to say ,COMMA quite a lot -DASH -DASH in order to get people's attention ,COMMA and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard .PERIOD 
So that's all I'm going to say about that .PERIOD 
I'm now going to talk about feasibility .PERIOD 
And the fundamental reason ,COMMA I think ,COMMA why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here .PERIOD 
A very simple definition .PERIOD 
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place ,COMMA which is to say ,COMMA metabolism .PERIOD 
This is not a completely tautological statement ;SEMICOLON it's a reasonable statement .PERIOD 
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars ,COMMA and it also happens to us ,COMMA despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms ,COMMA because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect .PERIOD 
So basically ,COMMA metabolism ,COMMA which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next ,COMMA has side effects .PERIOD 
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .PERIOD 
That's a fine definition .PERIOD So we can put it this way :COLON we can say that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we have this chain of events .PERIOD 
And there are really two games in town ,COMMA according to most people ,COMMA with regard to postponing aging .PERIOD 
They're what I'm calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrics approach .PERIOD 
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day ,COMMA when pathology is becoming evident ,COMMA and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time ,COMMA and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA it's a very short-term-ist strategy ;SEMICOLON it's a losing battle ,COMMA because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on .PERIOD 
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface ,COMMA because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA prevention is better than cure .PERIOD 
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -DASH -DASH even cells we're not really too good on yet .PERIOD 
We've discovered things like ,COMMA for example ,COMMA RNA interference only a few years ago ,COMMA and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .PERIOD 
Basically ,COMMA gerontology is a fine approach in the end ,COMMA but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention .PERIOD 
So then ,COMMA what do we do about that ?QUESTIONMARK 
I mean ,COMMA that's a fine logic ,COMMA that sounds pretty convincing ,COMMA pretty ironclad ,COMMA doesn't it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Before I tell you why it isn't ,COMMA I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two .PERIOD 
Just suppose ,COMMA as I said ,COMMA that we do acquire -DASH -DASH let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -DASH -DASH the ability to confer <NUM> extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age ,COMMA let's say <NUM> .PERIOD 
I'm going to call that robust human rejuvenation .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -DASH -DASH or equivalently ,COMMA of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -DASH -DASH would actually live ?QUESTIONMARK 
In order to answer that question -DASH -DASH you might think it's simple ,COMMA but it's not simple .PERIOD 
We can't just say ,COMMA Well ,COMMA if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies ,COMMA then they'll live <NUM> years longer .PERIOD 
That's the wrong answer .PERIOD 
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress .PERIOD 
There are two sorts of technological progress really ,COMMA for this purpose .PERIOD 
There are fundamental ,COMMA major breakthroughs ,COMMA and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames .PERIOD 
Fundamental breakthroughs :COLON very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .PERIOD 
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun ,COMMA and it took us until <NUM> to actually work out how to do it .PERIOD 
But after that ,COMMA things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .PERIOD 
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .PERIOD 
We can think ,COMMA really ,COMMA that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one ,COMMA if you like .PERIOD 
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .PERIOD 
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .PERIOD 
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .PERIOD 
Computers :COLON you can look at a more or less parallel time line ,COMMA happening of course a bit later .PERIOD 
You can look at medical care .PERIOD I mean ,COMMA hygiene ,COMMA vaccines ,COMMA antibiotics -DASH -DASH you know ,COMMA the same sort of time frame .PERIOD 
So I think that actually step two ,COMMA that I called a step a moment ago ,COMMA isn't a step at all .PERIOD 
That in fact ,COMMA the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension ,COMMA even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive ,COMMA will be at some sort of cusp .PERIOD 
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further <NUM> or maybe <NUM> years .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA they will be staying ahead of the game .PERIOD 
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .PERIOD 
This is a very important point for me to get across .PERIOD 
Because ,COMMA you know ,COMMA most people ,COMMA when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to <NUM> or more ,COMMA they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to <NUM> or more .PERIOD 
I'm not saying that at all .PERIOD 
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .PERIOD 
They'll never be perfect ,COMMA but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of ,COMMA before we have any 200-year-olds .PERIOD 
And the same for <NUM> and <NUM> and so on .PERIOD 
I decided to give this a little name ,COMMA which is longevity escape velocity .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it seems to get the point across .PERIOD 
If you're already <NUM> ,COMMA or even if you're <NUM> -DASH -DASH and an average 80-year-old ,COMMA we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies ,COMMA because you're too close to death's door for the really initial ,COMMA experimental therapies to be good enough for you .PERIOD 
You won't be able to withstand them .PERIOD 
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to ,COMMA that the first 150-year-old -DASH -DASH we don't know how old that person is today ,COMMA because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies .PERIOD 
But irrespective of that age ,COMMA I'm claiming that the first person to live to <NUM> -DASH -DASH subject of course ,COMMA to ,COMMA you know ,COMMA global catastrophes -DASH -DASH is actually ,COMMA probably ,COMMA only about <NUM> years younger than the first 150-year-old .PERIOD 
Alright ,COMMA so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk ,COMMA my last seven-and-a-half minutes ,COMMA on step one ;SEMICOLON namely ,COMMA how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?QUESTIONMARK 
And in order to do that ,COMMA I need to talk about mice a little bit .PERIOD 
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .PERIOD 
I'm calling it robust mouse rejuvenation ,COMMA not very imaginatively .PERIOD 
And this is what it is .PERIOD 
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse ,COMMA which basically means mice that live about three years on average .PERIOD 
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old .PERIOD 
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them ,COMMA and with those therapies ,COMMA we get them to live ,COMMA on average ,COMMA to their fifth birthday .PERIOD 
The question then is ,COMMA what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ?QUESTIONMARK 
Which we can now ,COMMA as I've explained ,COMMA equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .PERIOD 
Secondly ,COMMA what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things ,COMMA starting from the time we get the mice ?QUESTIONMARK 
And thirdly ,COMMA the question is ,COMMA what will it do to actually how much people want it ?QUESTIONMARK 
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question ,COMMA and it's extremely hard to answer .PERIOD 
One has to be very speculative ,COMMA and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation ,COMMA that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .PERIOD 
I say that's nonsense .PERIOD 
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .PERIOD 
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame ,COMMA in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I say that we have a <NUM>/<NUM> chance of reaching this RHR milestone ,COMMA robust human rejuvenation ,COMMA within <NUM> years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .PERIOD 
<NUM> years from the robust mouse .PERIOD 
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that .PERIOD 
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .PERIOD 
So they'll probably think it's five years away .PERIOD 
They'll be wrong ,COMMA but that actually won't matter too much .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA of course ,COMMA I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier ,COMMA the coping strategy .PERIOD 
That will be history at this point ,COMMA because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans ,COMMA since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice .PERIOD 
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice ,COMMA I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging .PERIOD 
I'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology .PERIOD 
But it is not part of metabolism itself .PERIOD 
And this turns out to be useful .PERIOD 
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .PERIOD 
We can say that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .PERIOD 
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment .PERIOD 
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .PERIOD 
So there's a third approach ,COMMA if we look at it this way .PERIOD 
We can call it the engineering approach ,COMMA and I claim that the engineering approach is within range .PERIOD 
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .PERIOD 
It does not intervene in this process or this one .PERIOD 
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle ,COMMA and it's something that we are within range of being able to do ,COMMA because it doesn't involve improving on evolution .PERIOD 
The engineering approach simply says ,COMMA Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -DASH -DASH not necessarily repair them completely ,COMMA but repair them quite a lot ,COMMA so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist ,COMMA that causes it to be pathogenic .PERIOD 
We know that this threshold exists ,COMMA because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age ,COMMA even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .PERIOD 
Why do I say that we're in range ?QUESTIONMARK Well ,COMMA this is basically it .PERIOD 
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .PERIOD 
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging ,COMMA we will be here all night ,COMMA because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .PERIOD 
This list is just for illustration ;SEMICOLON it is incomplete .PERIOD 
The list on the right is also incomplete .PERIOD 
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related ,COMMA and it's just an incomplete list .PERIOD 
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -DASH -DASH this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage ,COMMA side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end ,COMMA or that might cause pathology .PERIOD 
And there are only seven of them .PERIOD 
They're categories of things ,COMMA of course ,COMMA but there's only seven of them .PERIOD 
Cell loss ,COMMA mutations in chromosomes ,COMMA mutations in the mitochondria and so on .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .PERIOD 
Of course one can make a biological argument .PERIOD 
One can say ,COMMA OK ,COMMA what are we made of ?QUESTIONMARK 
We're made of cells and stuff between cells .PERIOD 
What can damage accumulate in ?QUESTIONMARK 
The answer is :COLON long-lived molecules ,COMMA because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage ,COMMA but then the molecule is destroyed -DASH -DASH like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -DASH -DASH then the damage is gone ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
It's got to be long-lived molecules .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA it's better than that ;SEMICOLON we actually know how to fix them all ,COMMA in mice ,COMMA in principle -DASH -DASH and what I mean by in principle is ,COMMA we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .PERIOD 
Some of them are partially implemented already ,COMMA the ones at the top .PERIOD 
I haven't got time to go through them at all ,COMMA but my conclusion is that ,COMMA if we can actually get suitable funding for this ,COMMA then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only <NUM> years ,COMMA but we do need to get serious about it .PERIOD 
We do need to really start trying .PERIOD 
So of course ,COMMA there are some biologists in the audience ,COMMA and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .PERIOD 
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk ,COMMA but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .PERIOD 
I've published a great deal on this ;SEMICOLON I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based ,COMMA and there's quite a lot of detail there .PERIOD 
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here .PERIOD 
So if you think that I'm wrong ,COMMA you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong .PERIOD 
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because ,COMMA as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you've got to actually do your homework ,COMMA in order to understand whether this is true .PERIOD 
And we'll just end with a few things .PERIOD 
One thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time ,COMMA and everyone said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA it's obviously impossible .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you know ,COMMA this does happen .PERIOD 
We have various strategies -DASH -DASH there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize ,COMMA which is basically an incentive to innovate ,COMMA and to do what you think is going to work ,COMMA and you get money for it if you win .PERIOD 
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute .PERIOD 
This is what's going to take a bit of money .PERIOD 
Not very long .PERIOD OK .PERIOD 
It's got to be philanthropic ,COMMA because profits distract biotech ,COMMA but it's basically got a <NUM> percent chance ,COMMA I think ,COMMA of succeeding in this .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
Chris Anderson :COLON OK .PERIOD I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it ,COMMA why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?QUESTIONMARK 
Because I am an old man .PERIOD I am actually <NUM> .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA as far as I know ,COMMA all the species have evolved to actually die ,COMMA so when cells divide ,COMMA the telomerase get shorter ,COMMA and eventually species die .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA why does -DASH -DASH evolution has -DASH -DASH seems to have selected against immortality ,COMMA when it is so advantageous ,COMMA or is evolution just incomplete ?QUESTIONMARK 
Brilliant .PERIOD Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer .PERIOD 
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question ,COMMA which I happen to agree with ,COMMA which is that ,COMMA no ,COMMA aging is not a product of selection ,COMMA evolution ;SEMICOLON [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect .PERIOD 
In other words ,COMMA we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging ;SEMICOLON you need more genetic pathways ,COMMA more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly ,COMMA and that carries on being true the longer you push it out .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA to the extent that evolution doesn't matter ,COMMA doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals ,COMMA living a long time or by procreation ,COMMA there's a certain amount of modulation of that ,COMMA which is why different species have different lifespans ,COMMA but that's why there are no immortal species .PERIOD 
The genes don't care but we do ?QUESTIONMARK 
That's right .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON Hello .PERIOD I read somewhere that in the last <NUM> years ,COMMA the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by <NUM> years .PERIOD 
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-year-old ?QUESTIONMARK 
If you lose a bit of weight .PERIOD 
Your numbers are a bit out .PERIOD 
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's not quite as good as you might think ,COMMA you might hope .PERIOD 
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .PERIOD 
Audience :COLON I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo ,COMMA and that the brain cells last <NUM> years or so .PERIOD 
If that is indeed true ,COMMA biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?QUESTIONMARK 
If there are cells in my body that live all <NUM> years ,COMMA as opposed to a typical ,COMMA you know ,COMMA couple of months ?QUESTIONMARK 
There are technical implications certainly .PERIOD 
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate ,COMMA especially neurons ,COMMA but we don't want to replace them any faster than that -DASH -DASH or not much faster anyway ,COMMA because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function .PERIOD 
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .PERIOD 
There are species that have no aging -DASH -DASH Hydra for example -DASH -DASH but they do it by not having a nervous system -DASH -DASH and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells .PERIOD 
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland ,COMMA because until a couple of years ago ,COMMA people knew hardly anything about us ,COMMA and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us .PERIOD 
But in the last couple of years we've become infamous for a couple of things .PERIOD 
First ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the economic meltdown .PERIOD 
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay .PERIOD 
By the way ,COMMA the pronunciation is Eyjafjallajokull .PERIOD 
None of your media got it right .PERIOD 
But I'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly .PERIOD 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone .PERIOD 
And I'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country .PERIOD 
But I can surely tell you that in my country ,COMMA much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere ,COMMA men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector ,COMMA and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems .PERIOD 
So we decided ,COMMA a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn't sustainable ,COMMA to found a financial services firm based on our values ,COMMA and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance .PERIOD 
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland .PERIOD 
We weren't known as the typical women women in Iceland up until then .PERIOD 
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then .PERIOD 
And we got a great group of people to join us -DASH -DASH principled people with great skills ,COMMA and investors with a vision and values to match ours .PERIOD 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients .PERIOD 
And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -DASH -DASH and also there's a factor of luck and timing -DASH -DASH we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .PERIOD 
So let me share with you our values .PERIOD 
We believe in risk awareness .PERIOD 
What does that mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking ,COMMA and we will not invest in things we don't understand .PERIOD 
Not a complicated thing .PERIOD 
But in <NUM> ,COMMA at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures ,COMMA it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market .PERIOD 
We also believe in straight-talking ,COMMA telling it as it is ,COMMA using simple language that people understand ,COMMA telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides ,COMMA and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter ,COMMA like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA although we do work in the financial sector ,COMMA where Excel is king ,COMMA we believe in emotional capital .PERIOD 
It is actually people that make money and lose money ,COMMA not Excel spreadsheets .PERIOD 
Last ,COMMA but not least ,COMMA we believe in profit with principles .PERIOD 
We care how we make our profit .PERIOD 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers ,COMMA we are willing to do it with a long-term view ,COMMA and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter .PERIOD 
But it wasn't just about the values ,COMMA although we are convinced that they matter .PERIOD 
It was also about a business opportunity .PERIOD 
It's the female trend ,COMMA and it's the sustainability trend ,COMMA that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come .PERIOD 
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ;SEMICOLON it is actually about women being different from men ,COMMA bringing different values and different ways to the table .PERIOD 
So what do you get ?QUESTIONMARK You get better decision-making ,COMMA and you get less herd behavior ,COMMA and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results .PERIOD 
But one has to wonder ,COMMA now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -DASH -DASH and by the way ,COMMA Europe looks pretty bad right now ,COMMA and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well .PERIOD 
Will government change ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this .PERIOD 
I have days that I believe ,COMMA but I have days that I'm full of doubt .PERIOD 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?QUESTIONMARK 
Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -DASH -DASH to do the same things over and over again ,COMMA hoping for a different outcome .PERIOD 
So I guess the world is insane ,COMMA because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again ,COMMA hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us .PERIOD 
Like TED ,COMMA I believe in people .PERIOD 
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious ,COMMA and they are going to start voting with their wallets ,COMMA and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside ,COMMA if they don't do it from the inside .PERIOD 
But I'm more of the revolutionary ,COMMA and I should be ;SEMICOLON I'm from Iceland .PERIOD 
We have a long history of strong ,COMMA courageous ,COMMA independent women ,COMMA ever since the Viking age .PERIOD 
And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society ,COMMA I was seven -DASH -DASH it happened to be my mother's birthday -DASH -DASH October <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> .PERIOD 
Women in Iceland took the day off .PERIOD 
From work or from home ,COMMA they took the day off ,COMMA and nothing worked in Iceland .PERIOD 
They marched into the center of Reykjavik ,COMMA and they put women's issues onto the agenda .PERIOD 
And some say this was the start of a global movement .PERIOD 
Five years later ,COMMA Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -DASH -DASH first female to become head of state ,COMMA single mom ,COMMA a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed .PERIOD 
And at one of the campaign sessions ,COMMA she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she couldn't become president -DASH -DASH she was a woman ,COMMA and even half a woman .PERIOD 
That night she won the election ,COMMA because she came back -DASH -DASH not just because of his crappy behavior -DASH -DASH but she came back and said ,COMMA Well ,COMMA I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation ;SEMICOLON I'm going to lead it .PERIOD 
So I've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today .PERIOD 
But in spite of that ,COMMA I went through the first <NUM> or <NUM> years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman .PERIOD 
Started in corporate America ,COMMA and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual ,COMMA that women and men would have just the same opportunities .PERIOD 
But I've come to conclude lately that it isn't like that .PERIOD 
We are not the same ,COMMA and it's great .PERIOD Because of our differences ,COMMA we create and sustain life .PERIOD 
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge .PERIOD 
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I'm fed up with this tyranny of either/or choices in life -DASH -DASH either it's men or it's women .PERIOD 
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance .PERIOD 
So let's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there ,COMMA and let's start thinking about doing good business .PERIOD 
That's how we change the world .PERIOD That's the only sustainable future .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
It's very ,COMMA very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this ,COMMA because everyone has spoken .PERIOD Everything has been said .PERIOD 
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here ,COMMA and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away ,COMMA and take forward and work on .PERIOD 
That's what I'd like to try and do .PERIOD 
We came here saying we want to talk about Africa :COLON the Next Chapter .PERIOD 
But we are talking about Africa :COLON the Next Chapter because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -DASH -DASH that we're looking at ,COMMA and saying it's not such a good thing .PERIOD 
The picture I showed you before ,COMMA and this picture ,COMMA of drought ,COMMA death and disease is what we usually see .PERIOD 
What we want to look at is Africa :COLON the Next Chapter ,COMMA and that's this :COLON a healthy ,COMMA smiling ,COMMA beautiful African .PERIOD 
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through the conference right from the first day ,COMMA where I heard that all the important statistics have been given -DASH -DASH about where we are now ,COMMA about how the continent is doing much better .PERIOD 
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on .PERIOD 
So I'm not going to spend too much time -DASH -DASH just to show you ,COMMA refresh your memories that we are here for Africa :COLON the Next Chapter because for the first time there really is a platform to build on .PERIOD 
We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen .PERIOD 
After decades of <NUM> percent ,COMMA we are now at <NUM> percent ,COMMA and it's going to -DASH -DASH projected -DASH -DASH <NUM> and <NUM> percent even .PERIOD 
And inflation has come down .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA from almost <NUM> billion down to about <NUM> or <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
Now this is a huge achievement .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA we've built up reserves .PERIOD Why is that important ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's because it shows off our economies ,COMMA shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build ,COMMA including businesses .PERIOD 
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased .PERIOD 
I want to remind you again -DASH -DASH I know you saw these statistics before -DASH -DASH from almost <NUM> billion we are now at about <NUM> billion .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA remittances -DASH -DASH I just took one country ,COMMA Nigeria skyrocketing -DASH -DASH skyrocketing is too dramatic ,COMMA but increasing dramatically .PERIOD 
And in many other countries this is happening .PERIOD 
Why is this important ?QUESTIONMARK Because it shows confidence .PERIOD 
People are now confident to bring -DASH -DASH if your people in the diaspora bring their money back ,COMMA it shows other people that ,COMMA look ,COMMA there is emerging confidence in your country .PERIOD 
And instead of an outflow ,COMMA you are now getting a net inflow .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA why is all this important ,COMMA to have to go really fast ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's important that we build this platform ,COMMA that we have the president ,COMMA Kikwete ,COMMA and others of our leaders who are saying ,COMMA Look ,COMMA we must do something different .PERIOD 
<NUM> percent of our population is below the age of <NUM> .PERIOD 
What does this mean ?QUESTIONMARK 
This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives .PERIOD 
You have to focus on how to create jobs ,COMMA make sure they don't fall into disease ,COMMA and that they get an education .PERIOD 
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life ,COMMA and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen .PERIOD 
And to support this ,COMMA I just recently -DASH -DASH one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria .PERIOD 
Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research .PERIOD 
People don't have voice .PERIOD 
There is no way you can know what people want .PERIOD 
One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue .PERIOD 
Like in every other country where this has been done ,COMMA jobs is the top issue .PERIOD 
I want to leave this up here and come back to it .PERIOD 
But before I get to this slide ,COMMA I just wanted to run you through this .PERIOD 
And to say that for me ,COMMA the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward -DASH -DASH and we mustn't make light of it .PERIOD 
It was only <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years ago we couldn't even talk about the next chapter ,COMMA because we were in the old chapter .PERIOD 
We were going nowhere .PERIOD 
The economies were not growing .PERIOD 
We were having negative per capita growth .PERIOD 
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there .PERIOD 
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this ,COMMA including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to .PERIOD 
Creating our own program to solve problems ,COMMA like fighting corruption ,COMMA building institutions ,COMMA stabilizing the micro economy .PERIOD 
So now we have this platform we can build on .PERIOD 
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here :COLON aid versus private sector ,COMMA aid versus trade ,COMMA etc .PERIOD 
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate .PERIOD 
And that's not what the debate should be about .PERIOD 
That's engaging in the wrong debate .PERIOD 
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors ,COMMA the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives ?QUESTIONMARK 
How do we combine all this ?QUESTIONMARK 
To move our continent forward ,COMMA to do the things that need doing that I talked about -DASH -DASH getting young people employed .PERIOD 
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent ,COMMA much of what you have seen here .PERIOD 
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate .PERIOD 
For me ,COMMA the issue about aid -DASH -DASH I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .PERIOD 
Africa has been giving the other countries aid .PERIOD 
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid .PERIOD 
And I said ,COMMA Mo ,COMMA you're right .PERIOD We have -DASH -DASH no ,COMMA but we've already been doing it !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
The U.K .PERIOD and the U.S .PERIOD could not have been built today without Africa's aid .PERIOD 
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa ,COMMA including human ,COMMA that built these countries today !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
So when they try to give back ,COMMA we shouldn't be on the defensive .PERIOD 
The issue is how are we using what has been given back .PERIOD 
How are we using it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Is it being directed effectively ?QUESTIONMARK 
I want to tell you a little story .PERIOD 
Why I don't mind if we get aid ,COMMA but we use it well .PERIOD 
From <NUM> to '<NUM> ,COMMA Nigeria fought a war -DASH -DASH the Nigeria-Biafra war .PERIOD 
And in the middle of that war ,COMMA I was <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking .PERIOD 
For the army -DASH -DASH my father joined the army as a brigadier -DASH -DASH the Biafran army .PERIOD 
We were on the Biafran side .PERIOD 
And we were down to eating one meal a day ,COMMA running from place to place ,COMMA but wherever we could help we did .PERIOD 
At a certain point in time ,COMMA in <NUM> ,COMMA things were really bad .PERIOD 
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day .PERIOD 
People ,COMMA children were dying of kwashiorkor .PERIOD 
I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA I was in the middle of it .PERIOD 
In the midst of all this ,COMMA my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days .PERIOD 
We thought she was going to die .PERIOD 
My father was not there .PERIOD 
He was in the army .PERIOD 
So I was the oldest person in the house .PERIOD 
My sister fell very ill with malaria .PERIOD 
And she had such a high fever .PERIOD We tried everything .PERIOD 
It didn't look like it was going to work .PERIOD 
Until we heard that <NUM> kilometers away there was a doctor ,COMMA who was looking at people and giving them meds .PERIOD 
It was really hot .PERIOD I was very hungry .PERIOD 
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman .PERIOD 
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people .PERIOD 
I walked <NUM> kilometers ,COMMA putting one foot in front of the other .PERIOD 
I got there and I saw huge crowds .PERIOD 
Almost a thousand people were there ,COMMA trying to break down the door .PERIOD 
She was doing this in a church .PERIOD How was I going to get in ?QUESTIONMARK 
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back ,COMMA find a way to a window .PERIOD 
And while they were trying to break down the door ,COMMA I climbed in through the window ,COMMA and jumped in .PERIOD 
This woman told me it was in the nick of time .PERIOD 
By the time we jumped into that hall ,COMMA she was barely moving .PERIOD 
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -DASH -DASH what I learned was the chloroquine then -DASH -DASH gave her some -DASH -DASH it must have been a re-hydration -DASH -DASH and some other therapies ,COMMA and put us in a corner .PERIOD 
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating ,COMMA which was a good sign .PERIOD 
And then my sister woke up .PERIOD 
And about five or six hours later ,COMMA she said we could go home .PERIOD 
I strapped her on my back .PERIOD 
I walked the <NUM> kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had .PERIOD 
I was so happy -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH that my sister was alive !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
Today she's <NUM> years old ,COMMA a mother of three ,COMMA and she's a physician saving other lives .PERIOD 
Why am I telling that ?QUESTIONMARK I'm telling you that because -DASH -DASH when it is you or your person involved -DASH -DASH you don't care where -DASH -DASH whether it's aid .PERIOD 
You don't care what it is !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
You just want the person to be alive !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And now let me become less sentimental ,COMMA and say that saving lives -DASH -DASH which some of the aid we get does on this continent -DASH -DASH when you save the life of anyone ,COMMA a farmer ,COMMA a teacher ,COMMA a mother ,COMMA they are contributing productively into the economy .PERIOD 
And as an economist ,COMMA we can also look at that side of the story .PERIOD 
These are people who are productive agents in the economy .PERIOD 
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS ,COMMA if we save them from malaria ,COMMA it means they can form the base of production for our economy .PERIOD 
And by the same token -DASH -DASH as someone said yesterday -DASH -DASH if we don't and they die ,COMMA their children will become a burden on the economy .PERIOD 
So even from an economic standpoint ,COMMA if we leave the social and the humanitarian ,COMMA we need to save lives now .PERIOD 
So that's one of the reasons ,COMMA from a personal experience ,COMMA that I say let's channel these resources we get into something productive .PERIOD 
However ,COMMA I will also tell you that I'm one of those who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer .PERIOD 
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated .PERIOD 
What has happened in Europe ?QUESTIONMARK 
Do you all know that Spain -DASH -DASH part of the EU -DASH -DASH got <NUM> billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU ?QUESTIONMARK 
Resources that were transferred to them -DASH -DASH and were the Spanish ashamed of this ?QUESTIONMARK No !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
The EU transferred <NUM> billion .PERIOD Where did they use it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Have you been to southern Spain lately ?QUESTIONMARK There are roads everywhere .PERIOD 
Infrastructure everywhere .PERIOD 
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy .PERIOD 
Did you know that Ireland got <NUM> billion dollars in aid ?QUESTIONMARK 
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today .PERIOD 
What did they do with the <NUM> billion dollars in aid ?QUESTIONMARK 
They used it to build an information superhighway ,COMMA gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution ,COMMA and to create jobs in their economy .PERIOD 
They didn't say ,COMMA No ,COMMA you know ,COMMA we're not going to take this .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA the European Union is busy transferring aid .PERIOD 
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain -DASH -DASH which is roads ,COMMA highways ,COMMA other things that they can build -DASH -DASH I say then ,COMMA why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries ?QUESTIONMARK 
When we ask them and tell them what we need ,COMMA one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now .PERIOD 
Now we talk about the World Bank ,COMMA IMF ,COMMA and accountability ,COMMA all that and the EU .PERIOD 
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -DASH -DASH some of them in this audience ,COMMA with private foundations .PERIOD 
And one day ,COMMA these foundations have so much money ,COMMA they will overtake the official aid that is being given .PERIOD 
But I fear -DASH -DASH and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -DASH -DASH but I'm also worried .PERIOD I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent .PERIOD 
And they're also going from country to country ,COMMA and many times trying to find what to do .PERIOD 
But I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way .PERIOD 
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent .PERIOD 
And many times I don't see Africans working with them .PERIOD 
They are just going alone !EXCLAMATIONMARK 
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know .PERIOD 
They want to visit us ,COMMA see what's happening on the ground and make a decision .PERIOD 
And now I'm maybe being harsh .PERIOD 
But I worry because this money is so important .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA who are they accountable to ?QUESTIONMARK 
Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money ?QUESTIONMARK Are we there ?QUESTIONMARK 
Will we make the same mistake that we made before ?QUESTIONMARK 
Have our presidents and our leaders -DASH -DASH everyone is talking about -DASH -DASH have they ever called these people together and said ,COMMA Look ,COMMA your foundation and your foundation -DASH -DASH you have so much money ,COMMA we are grateful .PERIOD 
Have we done that ?QUESTIONMARK The answer is no .PERIOD 
And each one is making their own individual effort .PERIOD 
And then <NUM> years from now ,COMMA billions will again have gone into Africa ,COMMA and we would still have the same problems .PERIOD 
This is what gives us the hopeless image .PERIOD 
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money ,COMMA Sit down .PERIOD 
And we don't do it because there are so many of us .PERIOD We don't coordinate .PERIOD 
We've not called the Bill Gates ,COMMA and the Soros ,COMMA and everybody else who is helping and say ,COMMA Sit down .PERIOD Let's have a conference with you .PERIOD 
As a continent ,COMMA here are our priorities .PERIOD 
Here is where we want you to channel this money .PERIOD 
Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best .PERIOD 
We're not trying to stop them at all !EXCLAMATIONMARK But to help them help us better .PERIOD 
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this .PERIOD 
Ten years from now we will have the same story ,COMMA and we will be repeating the same things .PERIOD 
So our problem right now is ,COMMA how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way ?QUESTIONMARK 
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too .PERIOD 
But it cannot do it alone .PERIOD 
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work .PERIOD 
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas .PERIOD 
So why don't we think of using some of this aid ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA why don't we first say to those helping us out ,COMMA Don't be shy about infrastructure .PERIOD 
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure .PERIOD 
That education will work better if we've got electricity and railroads ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market .PERIOD 
Don't be shy of it .PERIOD 
Invest some of your resources in that ,COMMA too .PERIOD 
And then we can see that this is one combination of private ,COMMA international ,COMMA multilateral money ,COMMA private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership ,COMMA so that aid can be a facilitator .PERIOD 
That is all aid can be .PERIOD 
But it can be catalytic .PERIOD And if we fail to use it as catalytic ,COMMA we would have failed .PERIOD 
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -DASH -DASH one of the reasons is not only just that ,COMMA you know ,COMMA these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources .PERIOD 
It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese .PERIOD 
If you tell them ,COMMA We need a road here ,COMMA they will help you build it .PERIOD 
They don't shy away from infrastructure .PERIOD 
He said ,COMMA There are two things you need only .PERIOD 
You are undisciplined .PERIOD 
It's the same .PERIOD We need infrastructure ,COMMA infrastructure and discipline .PERIOD 
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that .PERIOD 
Now I realize -DASH -DASH I'm not saying -DASH -DASH health and education -DASH -DASH no ,COMMA you can also provide that as well .PERIOD 
But I'm saying it's not either or .PERIOD 
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership .PERIOD 
One idea .PERIOD 
Second thing ,COMMA for the private sector ,COMMA people are afraid to take risks on the continent .PERIOD 
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms ,COMMA to enable people to take risk ?QUESTIONMARK 
And finally ,COMMA because they are both standing at my -DASH -DASH I'm out of time .PERIOD 
Am I out of time ?QUESTIONMARK 
OK ,COMMA so let me not forget my punchline .PERIOD 
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women ,COMMA to create jobs .PERIOD 
A lot has been said here about women ,COMMA I don't need to repeat it .PERIOD 
But there are people -DASH -DASH women -DASH -DASH creating jobs .PERIOD 
And we know ,COMMA studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -DASH -DASH in fact ,COMMA there's an econometric study ,COMMA the World Bank Review ,COMMA done in <NUM> ,COMMA showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children ,COMMA more for the household ,COMMA more for the economy and all that .PERIOD 
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here -DASH -DASH I'm not saying the men are not important -DASH -DASH obviously ,COMMA if you leave the husbands out ,COMMA what will they do ?QUESTIONMARK 
They'll come back home and get disgruntled ,COMMA and it will result in difficulties we don't want .PERIOD 
We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job ,COMMA and so on .PERIOD 
But at the margin ,COMMA we also -DASH -DASH I want to push this ,COMMA because the reason is the men automatically -DASH -DASH they get -DASH -DASH not automatically ,COMMA but they tend to get more support .PERIOD 
But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool .PERIOD 
There are people creating jobs .PERIOD 
Beatrice Gakuba has created <NUM> jobs from her flower business in Rwanda .PERIOD 
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria ,COMMA with the chair company .PERIOD 
She wants to expand .PERIOD 
She needs another <NUM> million .PERIOD 
She will create another <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> more jobs .PERIOD 
So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -DASH -DASH business people who want to expand and create more jobs .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity ,COMMA and I have never had a patient tell me that I really want you to be creative during surgery ,COMMA and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it .PERIOD 
And for me ,COMMA this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound ,COMMA particularly music .PERIOD 
And so I'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative .PERIOD 
I've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University ,COMMA but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously .PERIOD 
I'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .PERIOD 
I'm going to start off by playing a video for you .PERIOD 
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett ,COMMA who's a well-known jazz improviser and probably the most well-known ,COMMA iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level .PERIOD 
And he'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head ,COMMA and he'll never play it exactly the same way again ,COMMA and so ,COMMA as a form of intense creativity ,COMMA I think this is a great example .PERIOD 
And so why don't we go and click the video .PERIOD 
It's really a remarkable ,COMMA awesome thing that happens there .PERIOD 
I've always -DASH -DASH just as a listener ,COMMA as just a fan -DASH -DASH I listen to that ,COMMA and I'm just astounded .PERIOD 
I think -DASH -DASH how can this possibly be ?QUESTIONMARK 
How can the brain generate that much information ,COMMA that much music ,COMMA spontaneously ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so I set out with this concept ,COMMA scientifically ,COMMA that artistic creativity ,COMMA it's magical ,COMMA but it's not magic ,COMMA meaning that it's a product of the brain .PERIOD 
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art .PERIOD 
And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product ,COMMA I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process .PERIOD 
And I think there's some sub-questions there that I put there .PERIOD 
Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I think that's a good question .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music .PERIOD 
And so it brings the second question :COLON Why should scientists study creativity ?QUESTIONMARK 
Maybe we're not the right people to do it .PERIOD 
Well it may be ,COMMA but I will say that ,COMMA from a scientific perspective -DASH -DASH we talked a lot about innovation today -DASH -DASH the science of innovation ,COMMA how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy ,COMMA and truly ,COMMA we know very little about how we are able to be creative .PERIOD 
And so I think that we're going to see over the next <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years a real science of creativity that's burgeoning and is going to flourish .PERIOD 
Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this ,COMMA complex jazz improvisation ,COMMA and study it rigorously .PERIOD 
And so it gets down to the brain .PERIOD 
And so all of us have this remarkable brain ,COMMA which is poorly understood to say the least .PERIOD 
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers ,COMMA and I myself ,COMMA I'm not going to give you many answers today ,COMMA just ask a lot of questions .PERIOD 
And fundamentally that's what I do in my lab .PERIOD 
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this .PERIOD 
This is the main method that I use .PERIOD This is called functional MRI .PERIOD 
If you've been in an MRI scanner ,COMMA it's very much the same ,COMMA but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain ,COMMA but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain .PERIOD 
Now the way that's done is by the following .PERIOD 
There's something called BOLD imaging ,COMMA which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging .PERIOD 
Now when you're in an fMRI scanner ,COMMA you're in a big magnet that's aligning your molecules in certain areas .PERIOD 
When an area of the brain is active ,COMMA meaning a neural area is active ,COMMA it gets blood flow shunted to that area .PERIOD 
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI ,COMMA whereas oxyhemoglobin can't .PERIOD 
So through this method of inference -DASH -DASH and we're measuring blood flow ,COMMA not neural activity -DASH -DASH we say that an area of the brain that's getting more blood was active during a particular task ,COMMA and that's the crux of how fMRI works .PERIOD 
And it's been used since the '90s to study really complex processes .PERIOD 
Now I'm going to review a study that I did ,COMMA which was jazz in an fMRI scanner .PERIOD 
And this was done with a colleague of mine ,COMMA Alan Braun ,COMMA at the NIH .PERIOD 
This is a short video of how we did this project .PERIOD 
And it's a 35-key keyboard that is designed to fit both inside the scanner ,COMMA be magnetically safe ,COMMA have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players' legs while they're lying down in the scanner ,COMMA playing on their back .PERIOD 
And it works like this -DASH -DASH this doesn't actually produce any sound .PERIOD 
It sends out what's called a MIDI signal -DASH -DASH or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface -DASH -DASH through these wires into the box and then the computer ,COMMA which then trigger high-quality piano samples like this .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so it works .PERIOD 
And so through this piano keyboard ,COMMA we now have the means to take a musical process and study it .PERIOD 
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard ?QUESTIONMARK 
You can't just sort of -DASH -DASH It's great we've got this keyboard .PERIOD 
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .PERIOD 
And so the experiment really rests on the following :COLON What happens in the brain during something that's memorized and over-learned ,COMMA and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated ,COMMA or improvised ,COMMA in a way that's matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features ?QUESTIONMARK 
And so ,COMMA I have here what we call the paradigms .PERIOD 
There's a scale paradigm ,COMMA which is just playing a scale up and down ,COMMA memorized .PERIOD 
And then there's improvising on a scale -DASH -DASH quarter notes ,COMMA metronome ,COMMA right hand -DASH -DASH scientifically very safe ,COMMA but musically really boring .PERIOD 
And then there's the bottom one ,COMMA which is called the jazz paradigm .PERIOD 
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon ,COMMA that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner .PERIOD 
So in the end ,COMMA it's not the most natural environment ,COMMA but they're able to play real music .PERIOD 
And the musicians ,COMMA they were comfortable in the end .PERIOD 
And so we first measured the number of notes .PERIOD 
Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising ?QUESTIONMARK 
That was not what was going on .PERIOD 
And then we looked at the brain activity .PERIOD 
I'm going to try to condense this for you .PERIOD 
These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you're improvising versus when you're doing something memorized .PERIOD 
In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex ,COMMA the frontal lobe of the brain ,COMMA and in blue is this area that was deactivated .PERIOD 
As I like to say ,COMMA these are not the jazz areas of the brain .PERIOD 
They do a whole host of things that have to do with self-reflection ,COMMA introspection ,COMMA working memory and so forth .PERIOD 
Really ,COMMA consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe .PERIOD 
But we have this combination of an area that's thought to be involved in self-monitoring ,COMMA turning off ,COMMA and this area that's thought to be autobiographical ,COMMA or self-expressive ,COMMA turning on .PERIOD 
And we think ,COMMA at least in this preliminary -DASH -DASH it's one study ;SEMICOLON it's probably wrong ,COMMA but it's one study -DASH -DASH we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that ,COMMA to be creative ,COMMA you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe .PERIOD 
One area turns on ,COMMA and a big area shuts off ,COMMA so that you're not inhibited ,COMMA so that you're willing to make mistakes ,COMMA so that you're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses .PERIOD 
Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity -DASH -DASH sometimes it's done communicatively .PERIOD 
And so the next question was :COLON What happens when musicians are trading back and forth ,COMMA something called trading fours ,COMMA which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment ?QUESTIONMARK 
So this is a twelve-bar blues .PERIOD 
And I've broken it down into four-bar groups here ,COMMA so you would know how you would trade .PERIOD 
Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -DASH -DASH same way -DASH -DASH had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively .PERIOD 
So this is a musician ,COMMA Mike Pope ,COMMA one of the world's best bassists and a fantastic piano player .PERIOD 
So he's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it .PERIOD 
Mike ,COMMA come on in .PERIOD Mike Pope :COLON May the force be with you .PERIOD 
Nurse :COLON Nothing's in your pockets ,COMMA right Mike ?QUESTIONMARK 
Nope .PERIOD Nothing's in my pockets .PERIOD Nurse :COLON Okay .PERIOD 
You have to have the right attitude to agree to it .PERIOD 
It's kind of fun actually .PERIOD 
And so now we're playing back and forth .PERIOD 
He's in there .PERIOD You can see his legs up there .PERIOD 
And then I'm in the control room here ,COMMA playing back and forth .PERIOD 
Mike Pope :COLON This is a pretty good representation of what it's like .PERIOD 
And it's good that it's not too quick .PERIOD 
So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing ,COMMA of looking at my hands through two mirrors ,COMMA laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand .PERIOD 
That was challenging .PERIOD 
But again ,COMMA there were moments ,COMMA for sure ,COMMA there were moments of real ,COMMA honest-to-God musical interplay ,COMMA for sure .PERIOD 
At this point ,COMMA I'll take a few moments .PERIOD 
And so what you're seeing here -DASH -DASH and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science ,COMMA which is to show you preliminary data .PERIOD 
This is one subject's data .PERIOD 
This is ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA Mike Pope's data .PERIOD 
So what am I showing you here ?QUESTIONMARK 
When he was trading fours with me ,COMMA improvising versus memorized ,COMMA his language areas lit up ,COMMA his Broca's area ,COMMA which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left .PERIOD 
He actually had it also homologous on the right .PERIOD 
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication .PERIOD 
This whole notion that music is a language -DASH -DASH well maybe there's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all ,COMMA and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation .PERIOD 
And so we've done this actually on eight subjects now ,COMMA and we're just getting all the data together ,COMMA so hopefully we'll have something to say about it meaningfully .PERIOD 
Now when I think about improvisation and the language ,COMMA well what's next ?QUESTIONMARK 
Rap ,COMMA of course ,COMMA rap -DASH -DASH free-style .PERIOD 
And so I've always been fascinated by free-style .PERIOD 
And let's go ahead and play this video here .PERIOD 
Mos Def :COLON ♫ .. .PERIOD brown skin I be ,COMMA standing five-ten I be ♫ ♫ Rockin' it when I be ,COMMA in your vicinity ♫ ♫ Whole-style synergy ,COMMA recognize symmetry ♫ ♫ Go and try to injure me ,COMMA broke 'em down chemically ♫ ♫ Ain't the number <NUM> MC ,COMMA talk about how been I be ♫ ♫ Styled it like Kennedy ,COMMA late like a <NUM> to three ♫ ♫ When I say when I be ,COMMA girls say bend that key cut ♫ CL :COLON And so there's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free-style rap and jazz .PERIOD 
There are ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods .PERIOD 
In a lot a ways ,COMMA rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve .PERIOD 
And my colleagues kind of think I'm crazy ,COMMA but I think it's very viable .PERIOD 
And so this is what you do :COLON you have a free-style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them ,COMMA that they've never heard before ,COMMA and then you have them free-style .PERIOD 
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED ,COMMA and they said ,COMMA No ,COMMA you won't .PERIOD 
And then I thought -DASH -DASH But here's the thing .PERIOD 
So what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon ,COMMA please .PERIOD 
This is the control condition .PERIOD This is what they memorized .PERIOD 
Computer :COLON ♫ Memory ,COMMA thump .PERIOD ♫ CL :COLON ♫ Thump of the beat in a known repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme ,COMMA they make me complete ♫ ♫ The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ My passion's not fashion ,COMMA you can see how I'm dressed ♫ ♫ Psychopathic words in my head appear ♫ ♫ Whisper these lyrics only I can hear ♫ ♫ The art of discovering and that which is hovering ♫ ♫ Inside the mind of those unconfined ♫ ♫ All of these words keep pouring out like rain ♫ ♫ I need a mad scientist to check my brain ♫ I guarantee you that will never happen again .PERIOD 
So now ,COMMA what's great about these free-stylers ,COMMA they will get cued different words .PERIOD 
They don't know what's coming ,COMMA but they'll hear something off the cuff .PERIOD 
Go ahead and hit that right sound icon .PERIOD 
They are going to be cued these three square words :COLON like ,COMMA not and head .PERIOD 
He doesn't know what's coming .PERIOD 
Free-styler :COLON ♫ I'm like some kind of [unclear] ♫ ♫ [unclear] extraterrestrial ,COMMA celestial scene ♫ ♫ Back in the days ,COMMA I used to sit in pyramids and meditate ♫ ♫ With two microphones hovering over my head ♫ ♫ See if I could still listen ,COMMA spittin' off the sound ♫ ♫ See what you grinning ♫ ♫ I teach the children in the back of the classroom ♫ ♫ About the message of apocalyptical ♫ ♫ Not really though ,COMMA 'cause I've got to keep it simple ♫ ♫ [unclear] instrumental ♫ ♫ Detrimental playing Super Mario ♫ ♫ [unclear] boxes [unclear] hip hop ♫ CL :COLON So again ,COMMA it's an incredible thing that's taking place .PERIOD 
It's doing something that ,COMMA neurologically ,COMMA is remarkable .PERIOD 
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .PERIOD 
Creatively speaking ,COMMA it's just a phenomenal thing .PERIOD 
This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner .PERIOD 
We're here with Emmanuel .PERIOD 
That was recorded in the scanner ,COMMA by the way .PERIOD 
That's Emmanuel in the scanner .PERIOD 
Emmanuel :COLON ♫ Top of the beat with no repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme make me complete ♫ ♫ Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ I'm passing on fashion ;SEMICOLON you can see how I'm dressed ♫ CL :COLON Okay .PERIOD So I'm going to stop that there .PERIOD So what do we see in his brain ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA this is actually four rappers' brains .PERIOD 
You've got major cerebellar activity ,COMMA which is involved in motor coordination .PERIOD 
It's very preliminary ,COMMA but I think it's kind of cool .PERIOD 
So just to conclude ,COMMA we've got a lot of questions to ask ,COMMA and like I said ,COMMA we'll ask questions here ,COMMA not answer them .PERIOD 
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius ,COMMA neurologically ,COMMA and I think ,COMMA with these methods ,COMMA we're getting close to being there .PERIOD 
And I think hopefully in the next <NUM> ,COMMA <NUM> years you'll actually see real ,COMMA meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art ,COMMA and maybe we're starting now to get there .PERIOD 
And so I want to thank you for your time .PERIOD I appreciate it .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics ,COMMA then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country .PERIOD 
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .PERIOD 
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .PERIOD 
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .PERIOD 
And at top of that pyramid ,COMMA it's calculus .PERIOD 
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid .. .PERIOD 
that the correct summit -DASH -DASH that all of our students ,COMMA every high school graduate should know -DASH -DASH should be statistics :COLON probability and statistics .PERIOD 
It's one of the great products of the human mind .PERIOD 
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .PERIOD 
But I'm here to say ,COMMA as a professor of mathematics ,COMMA that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious ,COMMA meaningful way ,COMMA in their day-to-day lives .PERIOD 
On the other hand ,COMMA statistics -DASH -DASH that's a subject that you could ,COMMA and should ,COMMA use on daily basis .PERIOD Right ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's risk .PERIOD It's reward .PERIOD It's randomness .PERIOD 
I think if our students ,COMMA if our high school students -DASH -DASH if all of the American citizens -DASH -DASH knew about probability and statistics ,COMMA we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today .PERIOD 
Not only -DASH -DASH thank you -DASH -DASH not only that .. .PERIOD 
but if it's taught properly ,COMMA it can be a lot of fun .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA probability and statistics ,COMMA it's the mathematics of games and gambling .PERIOD 
It's analyzing trends .PERIOD It's predicting the future .PERIOD 
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital ,COMMA from the more classical ,COMMA continuous mathematics ,COMMA to the more modern ,COMMA discrete mathematics -DASH -DASH the mathematics of uncertainty ,COMMA of randomness ,COMMA of data -DASH -DASH that being probability and statistics .PERIOD 
In summary ,COMMA instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus ,COMMA I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means .PERIOD And I mean it .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
Up until now ,COMMA our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms .PERIOD 
Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch ,COMMA or even as complex as programming robotics ,COMMA we have always had to give a command to a machine ,COMMA or even a series of commands ,COMMA in order for it to do something for us .PERIOD 
Communication between people ,COMMA on the other hand ,COMMA is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .PERIOD 
We observe facial expressions ,COMMA body language ,COMMA and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .PERIOD 
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .PERIOD 
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do ,COMMA but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences .PERIOD 
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain ,COMMA our center for control and experience .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA it sounds like a pretty good idea ,COMMA but this task ,COMMA as Bruno mentioned ,COMMA isn't an easy one for two main reasons :COLON First ,COMMA the detection algorithms .PERIOD 
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons ,COMMA around <NUM> km of combined axon length .PERIOD 
When these neurons interact ,COMMA the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse ,COMMA which can be measured .PERIOD 
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses .PERIOD 
Each individual's cortex is folded differently ,COMMA very much like a fingerprint .PERIOD 
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain ,COMMA by the time the structure has been folded ,COMMA its physical location is very different between individuals ,COMMA even identical twins .PERIOD 
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals .PERIOD 
EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors ,COMMA like the one that you can see here in the photo .PERIOD 
A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion .PERIOD 
Now this is quite time consuming and isn't the most comfortable process .PERIOD 
And on top of that ,COMMA these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars .PERIOD 
So with that ,COMMA I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant ,COMMA who is one of last year's speakers ,COMMA who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop .PERIOD 
So the device that you see is a 14-channel ,COMMA high-fidelity EEG acquisition system .PERIOD 
It doesn't require any scalp preparation ,COMMA no conductive gel or paste .PERIOD 
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .PERIOD 
It's also wireless ,COMMA so it gives you the freedom to move around .PERIOD 
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system ,COMMA this headset only costs a few hundred dollars .PERIOD 
Now on to the detection algorithms .PERIOD 
So facial expressions -DASH -DASH as I mentioned before in emotional experiences -DASH -DASH are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .PERIOD 
But with the limited time we have available ,COMMA I'd like to show you the cognitive suite ,COMMA which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA Evan is new to this system ,COMMA so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him .PERIOD 
He's obviously not Joanne -DASH -DASH so we'll add user .PERIOD 
Evan .PERIOD Okay .PERIOD 
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal .PERIOD 
He just hangs out .PERIOD He's relaxed .PERIOD 
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain ,COMMA because every brain is different .PERIOD 
Evan Grant :COLON Let's do pull .PERIOD 
Tan Le :COLON Okay ,COMMA so let's choose pull .PERIOD 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .PERIOD 
So once we accept this ,COMMA the cube is live .PERIOD 
So let's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling .PERIOD 
So we have a little bit of time available ,COMMA so I'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task .PERIOD 
And this one is difficult because it's all about being able to visualize something that doesn't exist in our physical world .PERIOD 
This is disappear .PERIOD 
But with disappear ,COMMA there's really no analogies -DASH -DASH so Evan ,COMMA what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out ,COMMA okay .PERIOD 
Same sort of drill .PERIOD So :COLON one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA go .PERIOD 
Okay .PERIOD Let's try that .PERIOD 
Oh ,COMMA my goodness .PERIOD He's just too good .PERIOD 
Let's try that again .PERIOD 
Losing concentration .PERIOD 
But we can see that it actually works ,COMMA even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time .PERIOD 
As I said ,COMMA it's a very difficult process to imagine this .PERIOD 
And the great thing about it is that we've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about disappear .PERIOD 
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -DASH -DASH Thank you .PERIOD 
Good job .PERIOD Good job .PERIOD 
Thank you ,COMMA Evan ,COMMA you're a wonderful ,COMMA wonderful example of the technology .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA as you can see ,COMMA before ,COMMA there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan ,COMMA or any user ,COMMA becomes more familiar with the system ,COMMA they can continue to add more and more detections ,COMMA so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts .PERIOD 
And once you've trained up the detections ,COMMA these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform ,COMMA application or device .PERIOD 
In games and virtual worlds ,COMMA for example ,COMMA your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .PERIOD 
Obviously ,COMMA you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind .PERIOD 
And also ,COMMA colors ,COMMA lighting ,COMMA sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you're having ,COMMA in real time .PERIOD 
And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world ,COMMA with robots and simple machines ,COMMA for example -DASH -DASH in this case ,COMMA flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking lift with your mind .PERIOD 
The technology can also be applied to real world applications -DASH -DASH in this example ,COMMA a smart home .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains .PERIOD 
And of course ,COMMA also to the lighting -DASH -DASH turning them on or off .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA to real life-changing applications ,COMMA such as being able to control an electric wheelchair .PERIOD 
In this example ,COMMA facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .PERIOD 
Man :COLON Now blink right to go right .PERIOD 
Now blink left to turn back left .PERIOD 
Now smile to go straight .PERIOD 
We really -DASH -DASH Thank you .PERIOD 
We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today ,COMMA and with the community's input ,COMMA and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world ,COMMA we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here .PERIOD Thank you so much .PERIOD 
We invent .PERIOD 
My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas .PERIOD 
And we do that for a couple of reasons .PERIOD 
We invent for fun -DASH -DASH invention is a lot of fun to do -DASH -DASH and we also invent for profit .PERIOD 
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun ,COMMA you wouldn't have the time to do it .PERIOD 
So we do this fun and profit-oriented inventing for most of what we do ,COMMA but we also have a program where we invent for humanity -DASH -DASH where we take some of our best inventors ,COMMA and we say ,COMMA Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems ,COMMA which is with dramatic ,COMMA crazy ,COMMA out-of-the-box solutions .PERIOD 
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work ,COMMA so thank you .PERIOD 
So I'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we've got some solutions underway .PERIOD 
Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health ,COMMA a fantastic thing .PERIOD 
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered ,COMMA and that's because they need to be kept cold .PERIOD 
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures .PERIOD 
They go bad very quickly if you don't ,COMMA and if you don't have stable power grid ,COMMA this doesn't happen ,COMMA so kids die .PERIOD 
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters ;SEMICOLON it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated .PERIOD 
This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried :COLON These are Styrofoam chests .PERIOD These are being carried by people ,COMMA but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks .PERIOD 
We've got a different solution .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it .PERIOD 
And we thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA that's not really good enough .PERIOD 
So we made this thing .PERIOD 
This lasts six months with no power ;SEMICOLON absolutely zero power ,COMMA because it loses less than a half a watt .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is our second generations prototype .PERIOD 
The third generation prototype is ,COMMA right now ,COMMA in Uganda being tested .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas :COLON One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar ,COMMA something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in .PERIOD 
They have incredible insulation ,COMMA so let's put some incredible insulation here .PERIOD 
The other idea is kind of interesting ,COMMA which is ,COMMA you can't reach inside anymore .PERIOD 
Because if you open it up and reach inside ,COMMA you'd let the heat in ,COMMA the game would be over .PERIOD 
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine .PERIOD 
It vends out little individual vials .PERIOD 
So a simple idea ,COMMA which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world .PERIOD 
We'll move on to malaria .PERIOD 
Malaria is one of the great public health problems .PERIOD 
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this .PERIOD 
Two hundred million people a year .PERIOD 
Every <NUM> seconds a child in Africa dies ;SEMICOLON <NUM> will die during my talk .PERIOD 
And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved .PERIOD 
Another comment of Esther's was that we react when there's a tragedy like Haiti ,COMMA but that tragedy is ongoing .PERIOD 
So what can we do about it ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria .PERIOD 
You can spray ;SEMICOLON the problem is there are environmental issues .PERIOD 
You can try to treat people and create awareness .PERIOD 
That's great ,COMMA except the places that have malaria really bad ,COMMA they don't have health care systems .PERIOD 
A vaccine would be a terrific thing ,COMMA only they don't work yet .PERIOD 
People have tried for a long time .PERIOD There are a couple of interesting candidates .PERIOD 
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for .PERIOD 
You can distribute bed nets ,COMMA and bed nets are very effective if you use them .PERIOD 
You don't always use them for that .PERIOD People fish with them .PERIOD 
They don't always get to everyone .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA malaria is an incredibly complicated disease .PERIOD 
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle ;SEMICOLON they have sex ,COMMA they burrow into your liver ,COMMA they tunnel into your blood cells .. .PERIOD 
it's an incredibly complicated disease ,COMMA but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria :COLON There's a lot of potential ways in .PERIOD 
One of those ways might be better diagnosis .PERIOD 
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices .PERIOD 
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works :COLON You take a drop of blood ,COMMA you put it in there and it automatically tells you .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure ,COMMA create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it .PERIOD 
The other thing is ,COMMA you know ,COMMA it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood .PERIOD 
And if you look through the eye ,COMMA or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you may be able to do this directly ,COMMA without drawing any blood at all ,COMMA or through your nail beds .PERIOD 
Because if you actually look through your fingernails ,COMMA you can see blood vessels ,COMMA and once you see blood vessels ,COMMA we think we can see the malaria .PERIOD 
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin .PERIOD 
It's produced by the malaria parasite and it's a very interesting crystalline substance .PERIOD 
Interesting ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA if you're a solid-state physicist .PERIOD 
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it .PERIOD 
This is our femtosecond laser lab .PERIOD 
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond .PERIOD 
That's really ,COMMA really ,COMMA really short .PERIOD 
This is a pulse of light that's only about one wavelength of light long ,COMMA so it's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously .PERIOD 
So here's an image of red blood cells ,COMMA and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells .PERIOD 
Sort of like doing dialysis ,COMMA but for relieving the parasite load .PERIOD 
This is our thousand-core supercomputer .PERIOD 
We're kind of software guys ,COMMA and so nearly any problem that you pose ,COMMA we like to try to solve with some software .PERIOD 
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA we heard about bed nets earlier .PERIOD 
You spend a certain amount per bed net .PERIOD 
Or you could spray .PERIOD 
There's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness .PERIOD 
How can you tell ?QUESTIONMARK 
So we've created ,COMMA using our supercomputer ,COMMA the world's best computer model of malaria ,COMMA which we'll show you now .PERIOD 
We picked Madagascar .PERIOD 
We have every road ,COMMA every village ,COMMA every ,COMMA almost ,COMMA square inch of Madagascar .PERIOD 
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes ,COMMA and you have to model that and how they come and go .PERIOD 
Ultimately ,COMMA it gives you this .PERIOD 
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar .PERIOD 
And this is this latter part of the rainy season .PERIOD 
We're going to the dry season now .PERIOD 
It nearly goes away in the dry season ,COMMA because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed .PERIOD 
And then ,COMMA of course ,COMMA the next year it comes roaring back .PERIOD 
By doing these kinds of simulations ,COMMA we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ;SEMICOLON to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs -DASH -DASH how many bed nets versus how much spraying ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH or the social trade-offs -DASH -DASH what happens if unrest breaks out ?QUESTIONMARK 
We also try to study our foe .PERIOD 
This is a high-speed camera view of a mosquito .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA in a moment ,COMMA we're going to see a view of the airflow .PERIOD 
Here ,COMMA we're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we're illuminating with a laser .PERIOD 
By understanding how mosquitoes fly ,COMMA we hope to understand how to make them not fly .PERIOD 
This is a real ad .PERIOD 
This is one of those things you just can't make up .PERIOD 
Once upon a time ,COMMA this was the primary technique ,COMMA and ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA many countries got rid of malaria through DDT .PERIOD 
The United States did .PERIOD 
So we thought ,COMMA Well ,COMMA we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium ,COMMA the parasite involved .PERIOD 
What can we do to the mosquito ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA let's try to kill it with consumer electronics .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA that sounds silly ,COMMA but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use .PERIOD 
Your Blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser .PERIOD 
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately ;SEMICOLON that's what makes those little dots on the page .PERIOD 
And ,COMMA of course ,COMMA there's signal processing and digital cameras .PERIOD 
So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA in our company ,COMMA this is what we call the pinky-suck moment .PERIOD 
What if we could do that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Now ,COMMA just suspend disbelief for a moment ,COMMA and let's think of what could happen if we could do that .PERIOD 
Well ,COMMA we could protect very high-value targets like clinics .PERIOD 
Clinics are full of people that have malaria .PERIOD 
They're sick ,COMMA and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes .PERIOD 
You really want to protect them .PERIOD 
Of course ,COMMA if you do that ,COMMA you could also protect your backyard .PERIOD 
And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are <NUM> percent organic .PERIOD 
They're completely natural .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it actually gets better than this .PERIOD 
You could ,COMMA if you're really smart ,COMMA you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it ,COMMA and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size .PERIOD 
And then you could decide :COLON Is this an insect I want to kill ,COMMA or an insect I don't want to kill ?QUESTIONMARK 
Moore's law made computing cheap ;SEMICOLON so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes .PERIOD 
They're the only ones that are dangerous .PERIOD 
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .PERIOD 
Mosquitoes actually live .. .PERIOD their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar ,COMMA from flowers -DASH -DASH in fact ,COMMA in the lab ,COMMA we feed ours raisins -DASH -DASH but the female needs the blood meal .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA this sounds really crazy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK 
Would you like to see it ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA Eric Johanson ,COMMA who built the device ,COMMA actually ,COMMA with parts from eBay ;SEMICOLON and Pablos Holman over here ,COMMA he's got mosquitoes in the tank .PERIOD 
And we're going to show you ,COMMA instead of the kill laser ,COMMA which will be a very brief ,COMMA instantaneous pulse ,COMMA we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for ,COMMA actually ,COMMA quite a long period of time ;SEMICOLON otherwise ,COMMA you can't see it very well .PERIOD 
Take it away Eric .PERIOD 
Eric Johanson :COLON What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage .PERIOD 
And we have .. .PERIOD this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around .PERIOD 
And Pablos ,COMMA if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around .PERIOD 
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they're flying around ,COMMA which is kind of fun .PERIOD 
Next we can actually light them up with a laser .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA this is a low powered laser ,COMMA and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency .PERIOD 
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around .PERIOD 
That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing .PERIOD 
Finally ,COMMA let's see what this looks like .PERIOD 
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around ,COMMA being lit up .PERIOD 
This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening .PERIOD 
Here we have it running at high-speed mode .PERIOD 
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this ,COMMA and we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world .PERIOD 
So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em .PERIOD 
This is one of the first ones we did .PERIOD 
The energy's a little bit high here .PERIOD 
We'll loop around here in just a second ,COMMA and you'll see another one .PERIOD 
Here's another one .PERIOD Bang .PERIOD 
An interesting thing is ,COMMA we kill them all the time ;SEMICOLON we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair .PERIOD 
The wing motor is very resilient .PERIOD 
I mean ,COMMA here we're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's what I have .PERIOD Thanks very much .PERIOD 
Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world .PERIOD 
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today ,COMMA <NUM> calories are taken to produce it .PERIOD 
That's a lot .PERIOD 
I want to take something rather humble to discuss .PERIOD 
I found this in the farmers' market today ,COMMA and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later ,COMMA you're very welcome to .PERIOD 
The humble potato -DASH -DASH and I've spent a long time ,COMMA <NUM> years ,COMMA preparing these .PERIOD 
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime .PERIOD 
First of all ,COMMA it's planted ,COMMA and that takes energy .PERIOD 
It's then harvested .PERIOD 
It's then distributed ,COMMA and distribution is a massive issue .PERIOD 
It's then sold and bought ,COMMA and it's then delivered to me .PERIOD 
I basically take it ,COMMA prepare it ,COMMA and then people consume it -DASH -DASH hopefully they enjoy it .PERIOD 
The last stage is basically waste ,COMMA and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it .PERIOD 
There are different types of waste .PERIOD 
There's a waste of time ;SEMICOLON there's a waste of space ;SEMICOLON there's a waste of energy ;SEMICOLON and there's a waste of waste .PERIOD 
And every business I've been working on over the past five years ,COMMA I'm trying to lower each one of these elements .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like .PERIOD 
This is the restaurant ,COMMA Acorn House .PERIOD 
Front and back .PERIOD 
So let me run you through a few ideas .PERIOD 
Floor :COLON sustainable ,COMMA recyclable .PERIOD 
Tables :COLON Forestry Commission .PERIOD 
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood .PERIOD 
This bench ,COMMA although it was uncomfortable for my mom -DASH -DASH she didn't like sitting on it ,COMMA so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -DASH -DASH reusing ,COMMA a job that was pretty good .PERIOD 
I hate waste ,COMMA especially walls .PERIOD 
If they're not working ,COMMA put a shelf on it ,COMMA which I did ,COMMA and that shows all the customers my products .PERIOD 
The whole business is run on sustainable energy .PERIOD 
This is powered by wind .PERIOD All of the lights are daylight bulbs .PERIOD 
Paint is all low-volume chemical ,COMMA which is very important when you're working in the room all the time .PERIOD 
And that's a plastic polymer .PERIOD 
And I was thinking ,COMMA well I'm trying to think nature ,COMMA nature ,COMMA nature .PERIOD 
But I thought ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA experiment with resins ,COMMA experiment with polymers .PERIOD 
Will they outlive me ?QUESTIONMARK They probably might .PERIOD 
Right ,COMMA here's a reconditioned coffee machine .PERIOD 
It actually looks better than a brand new one -DASH -DASH so looking good there .PERIOD 
Now reusing is vital .PERIOD 
And we filter our own water .PERIOD 
We put them in bottles ,COMMA refrigerate them ,COMMA and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again .PERIOD 
Here's a great little example .PERIOD 
If you can see this orange tree ,COMMA it's actually growing in a car tire ,COMMA which has been turned inside out and sewn up .PERIOD 
It's got my compost in it ,COMMA which is growing an orange tree ,COMMA which is great .PERIOD 
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume .PERIOD 
Okay ,COMMA it's a small kitchen .PERIOD It's about five square meters .PERIOD 
It serves <NUM> people a day .PERIOD 
We generate quite a lot of waste .PERIOD 
You can't get rid of waste .PERIOD 
But this story's not about eliminating it ,COMMA it's about minimizing it .PERIOD 
I put my food waste into this dehydrating ,COMMA desiccating macerator -DASH -DASH turns food into an inner material ,COMMA which I can store and then compost later .PERIOD 
I compost it in this garden .PERIOD 
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food ,COMMA which is generated by the restaurant ,COMMA and it's growing in these tubs ,COMMA which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things .PERIOD 
Three compost bins -DASH -DASH go through about <NUM> kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -DASH -DASH really good ,COMMA makes fantastic compost .PERIOD 
A couple of wormeries in there too .PERIOD 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery .PERIOD I had a lot of worms in it .PERIOD 
And I tried taking the dried food waste ,COMMA putting it to the worms ,COMMA going ,COMMA There you go ,COMMA dinner .PERIOD 
It was like vegetable jerky ,COMMA and killed all of them .PERIOD 
I don't know how many worms [were] in there ,COMMA but I've got some heavy karma coming ,COMMA I tell you .PERIOD 
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system .PERIOD 
This takes the water out of the restaurant ,COMMA runs it through these stone beds -DASH -DASH this is going to be mint in there -DASH -DASH and I sort of water the garden with it .PERIOD 
And I ultimately want to recycle that ,COMMA put it back into the loos ,COMMA maybe wash hands with it ,COMMA I don't know .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA water is a very important aspect .PERIOD 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse .PERIOD 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with ,COMMA that would be great .PERIOD 
I managed to do it .PERIOD 
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -DASH -DASH same chairs ,COMMA same tables .PERIOD 
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable .PERIOD 
But this is an electrical restaurant .PERIOD 
The whole thing is electric ,COMMA the restaurant and the kitchen .PERIOD 
And it's run on hydroelectricity ,COMMA so I've gone from air to water .PERIOD 
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water ,COMMA heated by water ,COMMA filters its own water ,COMMA and it's powered by water .PERIOD 
It literally is Waterhouse .PERIOD 
The air handling system inside it -DASH -DASH I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there .PERIOD 
This is basically air-handling .PERIOD 
And this is an English willow air diffuser ,COMMA and that's softly moving that air current through the room .PERIOD 
Very advanced ,COMMA no air-conditioning -DASH -DASH I love it .PERIOD 
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange .PERIOD 
I have no idea how it works ,COMMA but I paid a lot of money for it .PERIOD 
And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -DASH -DASH it's off-grid ;SEMICOLON it generates all its own power .PERIOD 
There's no accident in names of these restaurants .PERIOD 
Acorn House is the element of wood ;SEMICOLON Waterhouse is the element of water ;SEMICOLON and I'm thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA I'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities .PERIOD 
I've got water and wood .PERIOD I'm just about to do fire .PERIOD 
I've got metal and earth to come .PERIOD 
Five weeks old ,COMMA it's my baby ,COMMA and it's hurting real bad .PERIOD 
The People's Supermarket .PERIOD 
So basically ,COMMA the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway .PERIOD 
What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people .PERIOD 
So people -DASH -DASH i.e. ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA more working-class -DASH -DASH or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative .PERIOD 
This is a social enterprise ,COMMA not-for-profit cooperative supermarket .PERIOD 
It really is about the social disconnect between food ,COMMA communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -DASH -DASH connecting communities in London to rural growers .PERIOD 
Really important .PERIOD 
So I'm committing to potatoes ;SEMICOLON I'm committing to milk ;SEMICOLON I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -DASH -DASH all very important stuff .PERIOD 
I've kept the tiles ;SEMICOLON I've kept the floors ;SEMICOLON I've kept the trunking ;SEMICOLON I've got in some recycled fridges ;SEMICOLON I've got some recycled tills ;SEMICOLON I've got some recycled trolleys .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA I'm trying and I'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world .PERIOD 
That's zero food waste .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA Sainsbury's ,COMMA if you're watching ,COMMA let's have a go .PERIOD Try it on .PERIOD 
I'm going to get there before you .PERIOD 
So nature doesn't create waste doesn't create waste as such .PERIOD 
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning ,COMMA and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time ,COMMA and it's an important statement to understand .PERIOD 
If we don't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food ,COMMA think about the sustainable nature of it ,COMMA then we may fail .PERIOD 
But ,COMMA I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we're more responsible .PERIOD 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable .PERIOD 
They're here .PERIOD You can see I've done three so far ;SEMICOLON I've got a few more to go .PERIOD 
The idea is embryonic .PERIOD 
I think it's important .PERIOD 
I think that if we reduce ,COMMA reuse ,COMMA refuse and recycle -DASH -DASH right at the end there -DASH -DASH recycling is the last point I want to make ;SEMICOLON but it's the four R's ,COMMA rather than the three R's -DASH -DASH then I think we're going to be on our way .PERIOD 
So these three are not perfect -DASH -DASH they're ideas .PERIOD 
I think that there are many problems to come ,COMMA but with help ,COMMA I'm sure I'm going to find solutions .PERIOD 
And I hope you all take part .PERIOD 
Thank you very much .PERIOD 
I would like to tell you about a project which I started about <NUM> years ago ,COMMA and it's about making new forms of life .PERIOD 
And these are made of this kind of tube -DASH -DASH electricity tube ,COMMA we call it in Holland .PERIOD 
And we can start a film about that ,COMMA and we can see a little bit backwards in time .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON Eventually ,COMMA these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches .PERIOD 
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution .PERIOD 
Theo Jansen :COLON I want to put these forms of life on the beaches .PERIOD 
And they should survive over there ,COMMA on their own ,COMMA in the future .PERIOD 
Learning to live on their own -DASH -DASH and it'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own .PERIOD 
Narrator :COLON The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food ,COMMA but from the wind .PERIOD 
The wind will move feathers on their back ,COMMA which will drive their feet .PERIOD 
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach ,COMMA with its nose pointed into the wind .PERIOD 
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand ,COMMA it stops ,COMMA and walks in the opposite direction .PERIOD 
Evolution has generated many species .PERIOD 
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa .PERIOD 
And it is a sort of race ,COMMA and each and every animal is different ,COMMA and the winning codes will multiply .PERIOD 
This is the wave ,COMMA going from left to right .PERIOD You can see this one .PERIOD 
And now it goes from -DASH -DASH yes ,COMMA now it goes from left to right .PERIOD 
This is a new generation ,COMMA a new family ,COMMA which is able to store the winds .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles ,COMMA which are on top of that .PERIOD 
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away ,COMMA and the tide is coming up ,COMMA and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives ,COMMA because they are drowned very easily .PERIOD 
I could show you this animal .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking .PERIOD 
There are <NUM> numbers ,COMMA which I call the <NUM> holy numbers .PERIOD 
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way .PERIOD 
It works the same as a wheel .PERIOD 
The axis of a wheel is staying on the same level ,COMMA and this hip is staying on the same level as well .PERIOD 
And the feet just step over the sand ,COMMA and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA <NUM> years after the invention of the wheel ,COMMA we have a new wheel .PERIOD And I will show you ,COMMA in the next video -DASH -DASH can you start it ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK -DASH -DASH that very heavy loads can be moved .PERIOD 
There's a guy pushing there ,COMMA behind ,COMMA but can also walk on the wind very well .PERIOD 
It's <NUM> tons .PERIOD 
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles .PERIOD 
It has a feeler ,COMMA where it can feel obstacles and turn around .PERIOD 
And that stuff ,COMMA you see ,COMMA is going to it the other way .PERIOD 
Can I have the feeler here ?QUESTIONMARK 
So ,COMMA they have to survive all the dangers of the beach ,COMMA and one of the big dangers is the sea .PERIOD This is the sea .PERIOD 
And it must feel the water of the sea .PERIOD 
And this is the water feeler .PERIOD 
And what's very important is this tube .PERIOD It sucks in air normally ,COMMA but when it swallows water ,COMMA it feels the resistance of it .PERIOD 
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea .PERIOD 
As soon as it touches the water ,COMMA you should hear a sort of sound of running air .PERIOD 
Yes !EXCLAMATIONMARK So if it doesn't feel ,COMMA it will be drowned ,COMMA OK ?QUESTIONMARK 
Here ,COMMA we have the brain of the animal .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA it is a step counter ,COMMA and it counts the steps .PERIOD 
It's a binary step counter .PERIOD 
It says ,COMMA well ,COMMA there's the sea ,COMMA there are dunes ,COMMA and I'm here .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
One of the biggest enemies are the storms .PERIOD 
This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere ,COMMA and when the nose is fixed -DASH -DASH of the animal -DASH -DASH the whole animal is fixed .PERIOD 
So when the storm is coming up ,COMMA it drives a pin into the ground .PERIOD 
And the nose is fixed ,COMMA the whole animal is fixed .PERIOD 
The wind may turn ,COMMA but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA another couple of years ,COMMA and these animals will survive on their own .PERIOD 
I still have to help them a lot .PERIOD 
Thank you very much ,COMMA ladies and gentlemen .PERIOD 
 .PERIOD 
We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell ,COMMA a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer ,COMMA building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals ,COMMA assembling that chromosome in yeast ,COMMA transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species .PERIOD 
So this is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer .PERIOD 
It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code .PERIOD 
But we'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute .PERIOD 
This is a project that had its inception <NUM> years ago when our team then -DASH -DASH we called the institute TIGR -DASH -DASH was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history .PERIOD 
And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought ,COMMA if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species ,COMMA could there be even a smaller genome ?QUESTIONMARK 
Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level ?QUESTIONMARK 
It's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions ,COMMA because it's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell .PERIOD 
You can only do them one at a time .PERIOD 
We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route ,COMMA even though nobody had been there before ,COMMA to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life .PERIOD 
That started our 15-year quest to get here .PERIOD 
But before we did the first experiments ,COMMA we actually asked Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks ,COMMA the challenges ,COMMA the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it hadn't been done before .PERIOD 
They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome ,COMMA but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA we started a new institute ,COMMA the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives ,COMMA where we set out two goals :COLON One ,COMMA to understand the impact of our technology on the environment ,COMMA and how to understand the environment better ,COMMA and two ,COMMA to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life .PERIOD 
Our first task was a <NUM> ,COMMA 000-letter code bacteriophage ,COMMA a virus that attacks only E .PERIOD coli .PERIOD 
So that was the phage phi X <NUM> ,COMMA which was chosen for historical reasons .PERIOD 
It was the first DNA phage ,COMMA DNA virus ,COMMA DNA genome that was actually sequenced .PERIOD 
So once we realized that we could make <NUM> ,COMMA 000-base pair viral-sized pieces ,COMMA we thought ,COMMA we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially .PERIOD 
There were several steps to this .PERIOD There were two sides :COLON We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules ,COMMA and we had to solve the biological side of how ,COMMA if we had this new chemical entity ,COMMA how would we boot it up ,COMMA activate it in a recipient cell .PERIOD 
We had two teams working in parallel :COLON one team on the chemistry ,COMMA and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells .PERIOD 
When we started this out ,COMMA we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem ,COMMA which is why we chose the smallest genome .PERIOD 
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one .PERIOD 
So there's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle .PERIOD 
And you should know that basically <NUM> ,COMMA probably <NUM> percent plus of our experiments failed .PERIOD 
So this was a debugging ,COMMA problem-solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA one of the most important publications we had was in <NUM> .PERIOD 
Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another .PERIOD 
I think philosophically ,COMMA that was one of the most important papers that we've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .PERIOD 
And we knew ,COMMA once that worked ,COMMA that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .PERIOD 
We didn't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there .PERIOD 
In <NUM> ,COMMA we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome ,COMMA a little over <NUM> letters of genetic code ,COMMA but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome .PERIOD 
We think in part ,COMMA because of its slow growth and ,COMMA in part ,COMMA cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening .PERIOD 
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease ,COMMA an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface ,COMMA and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations .PERIOD 
But at the time ,COMMA that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made .PERIOD 
And so both sides were progressing ,COMMA but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast ,COMMA putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us .PERIOD 
So in addition to doing the transplant ,COMMA we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell .PERIOD 
So our team developed new techniques for actually growing ,COMMA cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast .PERIOD 
So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted ,COMMA and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome .PERIOD 
When we did these experiments ,COMMA though ,COMMA we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell .PERIOD 
That little issue took the team two years to solve .PERIOD 
It turns out ,COMMA the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated ,COMMA and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme ,COMMA from digesting the DNA .PERIOD 
So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it ,COMMA we could then transplant it .PERIOD 
Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell .PERIOD 
And once we had done that ,COMMA now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it .PERIOD 
So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science ,COMMA we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast .PERIOD 
Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago ,COMMA we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome ,COMMA the mycoides chromosome ,COMMA knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation .PERIOD 
And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome .PERIOD 
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end ,COMMA and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence .PERIOD 
So the team developed new debugging software ,COMMA where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA .PERIOD 
And we found that <NUM> out of the <NUM> <NUM> ,COMMA 000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence .PERIOD 
So accuracy is essential .PERIOD 
There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error ,COMMA and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA ,COMMA as we did with the watermarks ,COMMA and it can tolerate all kinds of errors .PERIOD 
So it took about three months to find that error and repair it .PERIOD 
And then early one morning ,COMMA at <NUM> a.m .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA it's been a long route to get here :COLON <NUM> years from the beginning .PERIOD 
We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA .PERIOD 
Early on ,COMMA when you're working in a new area of science ,COMMA you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't ,COMMA and ,COMMA even worse ,COMMA leading others to believe it .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome ,COMMA leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell ,COMMA when it would have been just a contaminant .PERIOD 
And the first chromosome we built in <NUM> -DASH -DASH the <NUM> ,COMMA 000-base pair one -DASH -DASH we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code ,COMMA but it was using just amino acid single letter translations ,COMMA which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet .PERIOD 
So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code .PERIOD 
So it's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time ,COMMA but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because ,COMMA if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed ,COMMA it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions .PERIOD 
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons ,COMMA so it's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there are four major watermarks all over <NUM> base pairs of genetic code .PERIOD 
The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code .PERIOD 
So in the remaining information ,COMMA in the watermarks ,COMMA contain the names of ,COMMA I think it's <NUM> different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage .PERIOD 
And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code ,COMMA they can send an email to that address .PERIOD 
So it's clearly distinguishable from any other species ,COMMA having <NUM> names in it ,COMMA its own web address .PERIOD 
And we added three quotations ,COMMA because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work .PERIOD 
So we won't give the rest of the code ,COMMA but we will give the three quotations .PERIOD 
The first is ,COMMA To live ,COMMA to err ,COMMA to fall ,COMMA to triumph and to recreate life out of life .PERIOD 
It's a James Joyce quote .PERIOD 
The second quotation is ,COMMA See things not as they are ,COMMA but as they might be .PERIOD 
It's a quote from the American Prometheus book on Robert Oppenheimer .PERIOD 
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote :COLON What I cannot build ,COMMA I cannot understand .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science ,COMMA we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side .PERIOD 
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we've done -DASH -DASH asking for ethical review ,COMMA pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -DASH -DASH this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community ,COMMA in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government .PERIOD 
Even with this announcement ,COMMA as we did in <NUM> -DASH -DASH that work was funded by the Department of Energy ,COMMA so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House ,COMMA trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it .PERIOD 
And they came down on the side of open publication ,COMMA which is the right approach -DASH -DASH we've briefed the White House ,COMMA we've briefed members of Congress ,COMMA we've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances .PERIOD 
So with that ,COMMA I would like to open it first to the floor for questions .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA in the back .PERIOD 
Reporter :COLON Could you explain ,COMMA in layman's terms ,COMMA how significant a breakthrough this is please ?QUESTIONMARK 
Craig Venter :COLON Can we explain how significant this is ?QUESTIONMARK 
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is .PERIOD 
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change in how we view life .PERIOD 
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of ,COMMA it's taken us <NUM> years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do <NUM> years ago on understanding life at its basic level .PERIOD 
But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool .PERIOD 
We have ,COMMA at the Institute ,COMMA ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year .PERIOD 
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these ,COMMA Dan's team can now make these in less than <NUM> hours .PERIOD 
In the vaccine area ,COMMA Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that haven't been possible to date ,COMMA things where the viruses rapidly evolve ,COMMA such with rhinovirus .PERIOD 
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds ?QUESTIONMARK 
Or ,COMMA more importantly ,COMMA HIV ,COMMA where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today can't keep up with those evolutionary changes .PERIOD 
Also ,COMMA at Synthetic Genomics ,COMMA we've been working on major environmental issues .PERIOD 
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder .PERIOD 
We can't see CO2 -DASH -DASH we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it -DASH -DASH but we can see pre-CO2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf .PERIOD 
We need some alternatives for oil .PERIOD 
We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources ,COMMA make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO2 .PERIOD 
Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we're taking .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA here in the northwest ,COMMA we're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise ,COMMA defined <NUM> times as gardens watered by running streams .PERIOD 
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union ,COMMA this makes perfect sense to me .PERIOD 
But the thing is ,COMMA how come it's news to most people ?QUESTIONMARK 
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims who've begun reading the Koran ,COMMA but given up ,COMMA disconcerted by its otherness .PERIOD 
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world's greatest heroes ,COMMA yet even he called the Koran as toilsome reading as I ever undertook ,COMMA a wearisome ,COMMA confused jumble .PERIOD 
Part of the problem ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -DASH -DASH as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach ,COMMA as though God -DASH -DASH and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -DASH -DASH were just another author on the bestseller list .PERIOD 
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it's so easy to quote -DASH -DASH that is ,COMMA to misquote .PERIOD 
Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the highlighter version ,COMMA which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti-Muslim Islamophobes .PERIOD 
So this past spring ,COMMA as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad ,COMMA I realized I needed to read the Koran properly -DASH -DASH as properly as I could ,COMMA that is .PERIOD 
My Arabic's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary ,COMMA so I took four well-known translations and decided to read them side-by-side ,COMMA verse-by-verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh-century Arabic .PERIOD 
Now I did have an advantage .PERIOD 
My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a-Sunni split ,COMMA and for that I'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories ,COMMA so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers ,COMMA its frame of reference .PERIOD 
I knew enough ,COMMA that is ,COMMA to know that I'd be a tourist in the Koran -DASH -DASH an informed one ,COMMA an experienced one even ,COMMA but still an outsider ,COMMA an agnostic Jew reading some else's holy book .PERIOD 
So I read slowly .PERIOD 
I'd set aside three weeks for this project ,COMMA and that ,COMMA I think ,COMMA is what is meant by hubris -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH because it turned out to be three months .PERIOD 
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are .PERIOD 
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -DASH -DASH that feeling of I get it now -DASH -DASH it would slip away overnight ,COMMA and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land ,COMMA and yet the terrain was very familiar .PERIOD 
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels .PERIOD 
So one-third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham ,COMMA Moses ,COMMA Joseph ,COMMA Mary ,COMMA Jesus .PERIOD 
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -DASH -DASH jealously insisting on no other gods .PERIOD 
The presence of camels ,COMMA mountains ,COMMA desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert .PERIOD 
And then there was the language ,COMMA the rhythmic cadence of it ,COMMA reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours-long narrative poems entirely from memory .PERIOD 
And I began to grasp why it's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic .PERIOD 
Take the Fatihah ,COMMA the seven-verse opening chapter that is the Lord's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined .PERIOD 
And yet the more you add ,COMMA the more seems to go missing .PERIOD 
The Arabic has an incantatory ,COMMA almost hypnotic ,COMMA quality that begs to be heard rather than read ,COMMA felt more than analyzed .PERIOD 
It wants to be chanted out loud ,COMMA to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue .PERIOD 
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself ,COMMA or as Arthur Arberry called his version ,COMMA an interpretation .PERIOD 
As the Koran promises ,COMMA patience is rewarded ,COMMA and there are many surprises -DASH -DASH a degree of environmental awareness ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA and of humans as mere stewards of God's creation ,COMMA unmatched in the Bible .PERIOD 
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men ,COMMA using the second and third person masculine ,COMMA the Koran includes women -DASH -DASH talking ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA of believing men and believing women ,COMMA honorable men and honorable women .PERIOD 
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers .PERIOD 
Yes ,COMMA it does say that ,COMMA but in a very specific context :COLON the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden ,COMMA and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers .PERIOD 
Not You must kill unbelievers in Mecca ,COMMA but you can ,COMMA you are allowed to ,COMMA but only after a grace period is over and only if there's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba ,COMMA and only if they attack you first .PERIOD 
And even then -DASH -DASH God is merciful ;SEMICOLON forgiveness is supreme -DASH -DASH and so ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA better if you don't .PERIOD 
This was perhaps the biggest surprise -DASH -DASH how flexible the Koran is ,COMMA at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible .PERIOD 
Some of these verses are definite in meaning ,COMMA it says ,COMMA and others are ambiguous .PERIOD 
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities ,COMMA trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own .PERIOD 
Only God knows the true meaning .PERIOD 
The phrase God is subtle appears again and again ,COMMA and indeed ,COMMA the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe .PERIOD 
As in ,COMMA for instance ,COMMA that little matter of virgins and paradise .PERIOD 
Old-fashioned Orientalism comes into play here .PERIOD 
The word used four times is Houris ,COMMA rendered as dark-eyed maidens with swelling breasts ,COMMA or as fair ,COMMA high-bosomed virgins .PERIOD 
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word :COLON Houris .PERIOD 
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight .PERIOD 
Now this may be a way of saying pure beings -DASH -DASH like in angels -DASH -DASH or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē ,COMMA an eternal youth .PERIOD 
But the truth is nobody really knows ,COMMA and that's the point .PERIOD 
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be a new creation in paradise and that you will be recreated in a form unknown to you ,COMMA which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin .PERIOD 
That idea only came into being <NUM> years later ,COMMA and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps .PERIOD 
Paradise is quite the opposite .PERIOD 
It's not virginity ;SEMICOLON it's fecundity .PERIOD 
It's plenty .PERIOD 
It's gardens watered by running streams .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
I study ants ,COMMA and that's because I like to think about how organizations work .PERIOD 
And in particular ,COMMA how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that ,COMMA and there are many others .PERIOD The web is one .PERIOD 
There are many biological systems like that -DASH -DASH brains ,COMMA cells ,COMMA developing embryos .PERIOD 
There are about <NUM> species of ants .PERIOD 
And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control .PERIOD 
Nobody tells anybody what to do .PERIOD 
The queen just lays the eggs .PERIOD There's no management .PERIOD 
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant .PERIOD 
And I try to figure out how that works .PERIOD 
And I've been working for the past <NUM> years on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona .PERIOD 
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds .PERIOD 
This is the nest of the mature colony ,COMMA and there's the nest entrance .PERIOD 
And they forage maybe for about <NUM> meters away ,COMMA gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest ,COMMA and store them .PERIOD 
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site .PERIOD 
This is just a road .PERIOD And it's not very big :COLON it's about <NUM> meters on one side ,COMMA <NUM> on the other .PERIOD 
And every colony has a name ,COMMA which is a number ,COMMA which is painted on a rock .PERIOD And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before ,COMMA and figure out which ones have died ,COMMA and put all the new ones on the map .PERIOD 
And by doing this I know how old they all are .PERIOD 
And because of that ,COMMA I've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger .PERIOD 
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony .PERIOD 
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives -DASH -DASH those are the ones with wings -DASH -DASH on a mating flight .PERIOD 
So every year ,COMMA on the same day -DASH -DASH and it's a mystery exactly how that happens -DASH -DASH each colony sends out its virgin ,COMMA unmated queens with wings ,COMMA and the males ,COMMA and they all fly to a common place .PERIOD And they mate .PERIOD 
And she's in the process of mating with this male ,COMMA and there's another male on top waiting his turn .PERIOD 
Often the queens mate more than once .PERIOD 
And after that ,COMMA the males all die .PERIOD That's it for them .PERIOD 
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere ,COMMA drop their wings ,COMMA dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs .PERIOD 
And they will live for <NUM> or <NUM> years ,COMMA continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating .PERIOD 
So the queen goes down in there .PERIOD 
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves .PERIOD 
Then ,COMMA as soon as the ants -DASH -DASH the first group of ants -DASH -DASH emerge ,COMMA they're larvae .PERIOD Then they're pupae .PERIOD Then they come out as adult ants .PERIOD 
They go out ,COMMA they get the food ,COMMA they dig the nest ,COMMA and the queen never comes out again .PERIOD 
So this is a one-year-old colony -DASH -DASH this happens to be <NUM> .PERIOD 
There's the nest entrance ,COMMA there's a pencil for scale .PERIOD 
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer .PERIOD 
This is a three-year-old colony .PERIOD 
There's the nest entrance ,COMMA there's a pencil for scale .PERIOD 
They make a midden ,COMMA a pile of refuse -DASH -DASH mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat .PERIOD 
This is a five-year-old colony .PERIOD This is the nest entrance ,COMMA here's a pencil for scale .PERIOD 
This is about as big as they get ,COMMA about a meter across .PERIOD 
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -DASH -DASH so this is about <NUM> worker ants -DASH -DASH changes as a function of colony age ,COMMA in years .PERIOD 
So it starts out with zero ants ,COMMA just the founding queen ,COMMA and it grows to a size of about <NUM> or <NUM> thousand ants when the colony is five .PERIOD 
And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants ,COMMA when she's about <NUM> or <NUM> years old .PERIOD 
And it's when they reach this stable size ,COMMA in numbers of ants ,COMMA that they start to reproduce .PERIOD 
That is ,COMMA to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight .PERIOD 
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants .PERIOD 
So that's not the most fun part of this research ,COMMA although it's interesting .PERIOD 
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation .PERIOD 
That's not just how is the colony organized ,COMMA but how does it change what it's doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change ?QUESTIONMARK 
There's a lot of damage to the nest ,COMMA and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess .PERIOD 
When extra food becomes available -DASH -DASH and this is what everybody knows about picnics -DASH -DASH then extra ants are allocated to collect the food .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA with nobody telling anybody what to do ,COMMA how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task ?QUESTIONMARK 
And in harvester ants ,COMMA I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories :COLON where an ant is foraging ,COMMA when it's out along the foraging trail ,COMMA searching for food or bringing food back .PERIOD 
The patrollers -DASH -DASH that's supposed to be a magnifying glass -DASH -DASH are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active .PERIOD 
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go ,COMMA and by coming back -DASH -DASH just by making it back -DASH -DASH they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out .PERIOD 
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest ,COMMA and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house .PERIOD 
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area .PERIOD 
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest ,COMMA and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles .PERIOD 
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand ,COMMA put it down ,COMMA turn around ,COMMA and go back in .PERIOD 
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse .PERIOD 
On one day ,COMMA it'll all be here ,COMMA and then the next day they'll move it over there ,COMMA and then they'll move it back .PERIOD 
So that's what the midden workers do .PERIOD 
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest .PERIOD 
So that's only about <NUM> percent of the colony ,COMMA and they're the oldest ants .PERIOD 
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep as the colony is wide ,COMMA so about a meter deep for the big old nests .PERIOD 
And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber ,COMMA where we often find the queen ,COMMA after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes .PERIOD 
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes ,COMMA but instead because when there's flooding ,COMMA occasionally the colony has to go down deep .PERIOD 
So there's this whole network of chambers .PERIOD 
There's the larvae ,COMMA and they consume most of the food .PERIOD 
And this is true of most ants -DASH -DASH that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating .PERIOD 
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae .PERIOD 
When the foragers come in with food ,COMMA they just drop it into the upper chamber ,COMMA and other ants come up from below ,COMMA get the food ,COMMA bring it back ,COMMA husk the seeds ,COMMA and pile them up .PERIOD 
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest .PERIOD 
And curiously ,COMMA and interestingly ,COMMA it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA despite what it says in the Bible ,COMMA about ,COMMA you know ,COMMA Look to the ant ,COMMA thou sluggard ,COMMA in fact ,COMMA you could think of those ants as reserves .PERIOD 
That is to say ,COMMA if something happened -DASH -DASH and I've never seen anything like this happen ,COMMA but I've only been looking for <NUM> years -DASH -DASH if something happened ,COMMA they might all come out if they were needed .PERIOD 
But in fact ,COMMA mostly they're just hanging around in there .PERIOD 
And I think it's a very interesting question -DASH -DASH what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ?QUESTIONMARK 
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside .PERIOD 
And if you mark ants that are working outside ,COMMA and dig up a colony ,COMMA you never see them deep down .PERIOD 
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger .PERIOD 
They somehow get into this reserve .PERIOD 
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce .PERIOD 
And once they belong to the ants that work outside ,COMMA they never go back down .PERIOD 
Now ants -DASH -DASH most ants ,COMMA including these ,COMMA don't see very well .PERIOD 
They have eyes ,COMMA they can distinguish between light and dark ,COMMA but they mostly work by smell .PERIOD 
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony .PERIOD 
So when I first set out to work on task allocation ,COMMA my first question was ,COMMA What's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing ?QUESTIONMARK 
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others ,COMMA knowing its place on the assembly line .PERIOD 
And instead I wanted to ask ,COMMA How are the different task groups interdependent ?QUESTIONMARK 
So I did experiments where I changed one thing .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance ,COMMA early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active .PERIOD 
This is what it looks like about <NUM> minutes later .PERIOD 
Here it is about <NUM> minutes later .PERIOD 
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there .PERIOD 
And what I wanted to know was ,COMMA OK ,COMMA here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -DASH -DASH is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks ?QUESTIONMARK 
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked .PERIOD 
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers .PERIOD 
And lately we've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three-color system .PERIOD 
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA if I change the numbers performing one task ,COMMA it changes the numbers performing another .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up ,COMMA then I see fewer ants out foraging .PERIOD 
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks .PERIOD 
So for example ,COMMA if I put out extra food ,COMMA everybody else -DASH -DASH the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food ,COMMA they become foragers .PERIOD 
The nest maintenance workers become foragers .PERIOD 
The patrollers become foragers .PERIOD 
But not every transition is possible .PERIOD And this shows how it works .PERIOD 
Like I just said ,COMMA if there is more food to collect ,COMMA the patrollers ,COMMA the midden workers ,COMMA the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage .PERIOD 
If there's more patrolling to do -DASH -DASH so I created a disturbance ,COMMA so extra patrollers were needed -DASH -DASH the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol .PERIOD 
But if more nest maintenance work is needed -DASH -DASH for example ,COMMA if I put out a bunch of toothpicks -DASH -DASH then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance ,COMMA they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest .PERIOD 
So foraging acts as a sink ,COMMA and the ants inside the nest act as a source .PERIOD 
And finally ,COMMA it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA for example ,COMMA when there's extra nest maintenance work to do ,COMMA it's not that the foragers switch over .PERIOD I know that they don't do that .PERIOD 
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out .PERIOD 
And here was the most intriguing result :COLON the task allocation .PERIOD 
When I do these experiments with older colonies -DASH -DASH so ones that are five years or older -DASH -DASH they're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic .PERIOD The worse things get ,COMMA the more I hassle them ,COMMA the more they act like undisturbed colonies .PERIOD 
Whereas the young ,COMMA small colonies -DASH -DASH the two-year-old colonies of just <NUM> ants -DASH -DASH are much more variable .PERIOD 
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year .PERIOD 
It could be this year ,COMMA or this year .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony .PERIOD 
It's not due to the experience of older ,COMMA wiser ants .PERIOD 
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size .PERIOD 
So since I've had this result ,COMMA I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules -DASH -DASH very simple ,COMMA local ,COMMA probably olfactory ,COMMA chemical rules could an ant could be using ,COMMA since no ant can assess the global situation -DASH -DASH that would have the outcome that I see ,COMMA these predictable dynamics ,COMMA in who does what task .PERIOD 
And it would change as the colony gets larger .PERIOD 
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact .PERIOD 
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae .PERIOD 
They smell with their antennae .PERIOD 
When one ant touches another ,COMMA it's smelling it ,COMMA and it can tell ,COMMA for example ,COMMA whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other ,COMMA through grooming ,COMMA with a layer of grease ,COMMA which carries a colony-specific odor .PERIOD 
And so what the message is ,COMMA is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another ,COMMA but the pattern .PERIOD 
The pattern itself is the message .PERIOD 
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that .PERIOD 
But first you might be wondering :COLON how is it that an ant can tell ,COMMA for example ,COMMA I'm a forager .PERIOD 
I expect to meet another forager every so often .PERIOD 
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers ,COMMA I'm less likely to forage .PERIOD 
So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker .PERIOD 
And we've learned that ,COMMA in this species -DASH -DASH and I suspect in others as well -DASH -DASH these hydrocarbons ,COMMA this layer of grease on the outside of ants ,COMMA is different as ants perform different tasks .PERIOD 
And we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside ,COMMA the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change ,COMMA and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .PERIOD 
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -DASH -DASH they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks .PERIOD 
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it ,COMMA as they would to contact with real ants .PERIOD 
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance .PERIOD 
They've gone out to do different tasks ,COMMA and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines ,COMMA or influences ,COMMA each ant's decision about whether to go out ,COMMA and which task to perform .PERIOD 
In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope .PERIOD 
But the idea is that the ants are in there ,COMMA and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -DASH -DASH a stream of contacts with other ants .PERIOD 
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out ,COMMA and what it does when it comes back out .PERIOD 
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these .PERIOD 
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip ,COMMA are contacting the ants coming in .PERIOD 
It's variable .PERIOD It's noisy .PERIOD And ,COMMA in particular ,COMMA in two ways .PERIOD 
The first is that the experience of the ant -DASH -DASH of each ant -DASH -DASH can't be very predictable .PERIOD 
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside .PERIOD 
And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA we do a lot of simulation and modeling ,COMMA and also experimental work ,COMMA to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to ,COMMA in the aggregate ,COMMA produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies .PERIOD 
In fact ,COMMA if you watch ants at all ,COMMA you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it .PERIOD 
So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts ,COMMA perfection arises .PERIOD 
But it works pretty well .PERIOD 
Ants have been around for several hundred million years .PERIOD 
They cover the earth ,COMMA except for Antarctica .PERIOD 
Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts ,COMMA in the aggregate ,COMMA produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants .PERIOD 
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -DASH -DASH this network of interaction patterns -DASH -DASH to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies .PERIOD 
So the one thing ,COMMA though ,COMMA that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size .PERIOD 
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -DASH -DASH and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule ,COMMA like I expect to meet another forager every three seconds .PERIOD 
But in a small colony ,COMMA it's likely to meet fewer foragers ,COMMA just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet .PERIOD 
So this is the kind of rule that ,COMMA as the colony develops and gets older and larger ,COMMA will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one .PERIOD 
Thank you .PERIOD 
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution ,COMMA but I'd like to argue that it's done ;SEMICOLON we won .PERIOD 
We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it .PERIOD 
And I'd like to look after that ,COMMA to look what comes after the digital revolution .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA let me start projecting forward .PERIOD 
These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT ,COMMA looking what comes after computers .PERIOD 
This first one ,COMMA Internet Zero ,COMMA up here -DASH -DASH this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag -DASH -DASH about a dollar -DASH -DASH that can go in every light bulb and doorknob ,COMMA and this is getting commercialized very quickly .PERIOD 
And what's interesting about it isn't the cost ;SEMICOLON it's the way it encodes the Internet .PERIOD 
It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically ;SEMICOLON you can communicate acoustically through a power line ,COMMA through RF .PERIOD 
It takes the original principle of the Internet ,COMMA which is inter-networking computers ,COMMA and now lets devices inter-network .PERIOD 
So this is the next step from there to here ,COMMA and this is getting commercialized today .PERIOD 
A step after that is a project on fungible computers .PERIOD 
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA half as much grain is half as much useful ,COMMA but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer ,COMMA and we've been trying to make computers that work that way .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA what you see in the background is a prototype .PERIOD 
This was from a thesis of a student ,COMMA Bill Butow ,COMMA now at Intel ,COMMA who wondered why ,COMMA instead of making bigger and bigger chips ,COMMA you don't make small chips ,COMMA put them in a viscous medium ,COMMA and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch .PERIOD 
And that's what you see here .PERIOD 
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ;SEMICOLON on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made ,COMMA but there's no frame buffer ,COMMA IO processor ,COMMA any of that stuff -DASH -DASH it's just this material .PERIOD 
If you add twice as much of it ,COMMA you have twice as much display .PERIOD 
If you shoot a gun through the middle ,COMMA nothing happens .PERIOD 
If you need more resource ,COMMA you just apply more computer .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA that's the step after this -DASH -DASH of computing as a raw material .PERIOD 
That's still conventional bits ,COMMA the step after that is -DASH -DASH this is an earlier prototype in the lab ;SEMICOLON this is high-speed video slowed down .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA integrating chemistry in computation ,COMMA where the bits are bubbles .PERIOD 
This is showing making bits ,COMMA this is showing -DASH -DASH once again ,COMMA slowed down so you can see it ,COMMA bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information .PERIOD And ,COMMA ultimately ,COMMA these are some slides from an early project I did ,COMMA computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms ,COMMA so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules .PERIOD 
All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further ,COMMA not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms ,COMMA and they lead to the following recognition .PERIOD 
We all know we've had a digital revolution ,COMMA but what is that ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA Shannon took us ,COMMA in the '40s ,COMMA from here to here :COLON from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet .PERIOD And he proved the first threshold theorem ,COMMA that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal ,COMMA you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device .PERIOD 
And that's when we got the Internet .PERIOD 
Von Neumann ,COMMA in the '50s ,COMMA did the same thing for computing ;SEMICOLON he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect .PERIOD This was the last great analog computer at MIT :COLON a differential analyzer ,COMMA and the more you ran it ,COMMA the worse the answer got .PERIOD 
After Von Neumann ,COMMA we have the Pentium ,COMMA where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one .PERIOD 
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner .PERIOD 
A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal ,COMMA or you maybe melt some plastic .PERIOD A 10-billion-dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize -DASH -DASH you spread stuff around and bake it .PERIOD 
All the intelligence is external to the system ;SEMICOLON the materials don't have information .PERIOD 
Yesterday you heard about molecular biology ,COMMA which fundamentally computes to build .PERIOD 
It's an information processing system .PERIOD 
We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation ,COMMA but precisely the same idea ,COMMA precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did ,COMMA hasn't yet come out to the physical world .PERIOD So ,COMMA inspired by that ,COMMA colleagues in this program -DASH -DASH the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT -DASH -DASH which is a group of people ,COMMA like me ,COMMA who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science .PERIOD I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH because the canon -DASH -DASH computer science -DASH -DASH many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in <NUM> ,COMMA and nature's a much more powerful computer than that .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA you'll hear ,COMMA tomorrow ,COMMA from Saul Griffith .PERIOD He was one of the first students to emerge from this program .PERIOD 
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA there's no feedback to a tool metrology ;SEMICOLON the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated .PERIOD So ,COMMA you can ,COMMA for example ,COMMA do that .PERIOD 
You can do other things .PERIOD That's in 2D .PERIOD It works in 3D .PERIOD 
The video on the upper right -DASH -DASH I won't show for time -DASH -DASH shows self-replication ,COMMA templating so something can make something that can make something ,COMMA and we're doing that now over ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA nine orders of magnitude .PERIOD Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism ,COMMA in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly -DASH -DASH so ,COMMA much like the magnets ,COMMA but now on nanometer scales .PERIOD 
Laser micro-machining :COLON essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems ,COMMA all the way up to building buildings ,COMMA not by having blueprints ,COMMA but having the parts code for the structure of the building .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication .PERIOD Computers that don't control tools but computers that are tools ,COMMA where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .PERIOD 
Now ,COMMA to do that -DASH -DASH with your tax dollars ,COMMA thank you -DASH -DASH I bought all these machines .PERIOD We made a modest proposal to the NSF .PERIOD We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale ,COMMA all in one place ,COMMA because you can't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale .PERIOD 
So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems .PERIOD 
So I started teaching a class ,COMMA modestly called ,COMMA How To Make Almost Anything .PERIOD And that wasn't meant to be provocative ;SEMICOLON it was just for a few research students .PERIOD 
But the first day of class looked like this .PERIOD 
You know ,COMMA hundreds of people came in begging ,COMMA all my life I've been waiting for this class ;SEMICOLON I'll do anything to do it .PERIOD 
Then they'd ask ,COMMA can you teach it at MIT ?QUESTIONMARK It seems too useful ?QUESTIONMARK 
And then the next -DASH -DASH -DASH -DASH surprising thing was they weren't there to do research .PERIOD 
They were there because they wanted to make stuff .PERIOD 
They had no conventional technical background .PERIOD 
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills .PERIOD 
I'll show an old video .PERIOD Kelly was a sculptor ,COMMA and this is what she did with her semester project .PERIOD 
 :COLON Kelly :COLON Hi ,COMMA I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy .PERIOD 
Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream ,COMMA but you can't because you're at work ,COMMA or you're in a classroom ,COMMA or you're watching your children ,COMMA or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted ?QUESTIONMARK 
Well ,COMMA scream buddy is a portable space for screaming .PERIOD 
It is also recorded for later release where ,COMMA when and how the user chooses .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA Einstein would like this .PERIOD 
This student made a web browser for parrots -DASH -DASH lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots .PERIOD 
This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you're awake ;SEMICOLON this is one that defends -DASH -DASH a dress that defends your personal space .PERIOD 
This isn't technology for communication ;SEMICOLON it's technology to prevent it .PERIOD 
This is a device that lets you see your music .PERIOD 
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines ,COMMA and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing .PERIOD 
Just year after year -DASH -DASH and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person .PERIOD 
You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart ;SEMICOLON you need this for what makes you unique .PERIOD 
Ken Olsen famously said ,COMMA nobody needs a computer in the home .PERIOD 
You need it for what makes you unique ,COMMA just like personalization .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA with that ,COMMA in turn ,COMMA <NUM> million dollars today does this ;SEMICOLON <NUM> years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything .PERIOD 
The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication .PERIOD 
Today ,COMMA when you spend that much of your money ,COMMA there's a government requirement to do outreach ,COMMA which often means classes at a local school ,COMMA a website -DASH -DASH stuff that's just not that exciting .PERIOD 
So ,COMMA I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it ,COMMA I'd give people the tools .PERIOD 
This wasn't meant to be provocative or important ,COMMA but we put together these Fab Labs .PERIOD It's about <NUM> dollars in equipment that approximate both what the <NUM> million dollars does and where it's going .PERIOD 
A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D ,COMMA a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics ,COMMA a micron scale ,COMMA numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures ,COMMA programming tools for less than a dollar ,COMMA 100-nanosecond microcontrollers .PERIOD It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up ,COMMA and they exploded around the world .PERIOD
